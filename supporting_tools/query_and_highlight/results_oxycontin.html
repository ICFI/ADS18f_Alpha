<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are designed to provide controlled delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Breaking, chewing or crushing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets eliminates the controlled delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is pH independent. Oxycodone is well absorbed from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets with an oral bioavailability of 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing in normal volunteers in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Dose proportionality andor bioavailability has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC). Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively. These doses are 3 and 46 times a human dose of 160 mgday, based on mgkg basis. The results did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. The administration of oxycodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Interactions with other CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used with caution and started in a reduced dosage (13 to 12 of the usual dosage) in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for preemptive analgesia (administration preoperatively for the management of postoperative pain). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting has not been established. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the postoperative period if the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (See American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented. Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level. Tolerance and Physical Dependence Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy ). Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver Patients should be aware that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets will release all their contents at once if broken, chewed, or crushed, resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> without consulting the prescribing professional. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. Patients should be instructed to keep <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a secure place out of the reach of children. When <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addictive disorders. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence, either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Although clinical studies have not been conducted, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inducers of CYP3A4 Although clinical studies have not been conducted, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug, which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy, or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inducers. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance with this agent. Clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction, however. Use with CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies of oxycodone to evaluate its carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Oxycodone was not mutagenic in the following assays Ames Salmonella and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at doses of up to 5000 g, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes in the absence of metabolic activation at doses of up to 1500 gmL and with activation 48 hours after exposure at doses of up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in mice (at plasma levels of up to 48 gmL). Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation in the human chromosomal aberration test (at greater than or equal to 1250 gmL) at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure and in the mouse lymphoma assay at doses of 50 gmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 gmL or greater without metabolic activation. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively. These doses are 3 and 46 times a human dose of 160 mgday, based on mgkg basis. The results did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery. Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of oxycodone have been detected in breast milk. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because of the possibility of sedation andor respiratory depression in the infant. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18. It must be remembered that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets cannot be crushed or divided for administration. Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Laboratory Monitoring Due to the broad range of plasma concentrations seen in clinical populations, the varying degrees of pain, and the development of tolerance, plasma oxycodone measurements are usually not helpful in clinical management. Plasma concentrations of the active drug substance may be of value in selected, unusual or complex cases. Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment indicates greater plasma concentrations than those with normal function. The initiation of therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and careful dose titration is warranted. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. Dosages should be adjusted according to the clinical situation. Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation and in theory can be affected by drugs affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes. Oxycodone is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 to oxymorphone which represents less than 15 of the total administered dose. This route of elimination may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants). However, in a study involving 10 subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged., DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is NOT intended for use as a prn analgesic. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case, initiating therapy at the appropriate point along a progression from nonopioid analgesics, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acetaminophen to opioids in a plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly known as the Agency for HealthCare Policy and Research), the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines, or the American Pain Society. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 1224 hours following surgery), or if the pain is mild, or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate. (See American Pain Society guidelines.)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. In normal volunteers, the t of absorption is 0.4 hours for immediaterelease oral oxycodone. In contrast, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets exhibit a biphasic absorption pattern with two apparent absorption halflives of 0.6 and 6.9 hours, which describes the initial release of oxycodone from the tablet followed by a prolonged release., Plasma Oxycodone by Time Dose proportionality has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 1 below). Another study established that the 160 mg tablet is bioequivalent to 2 x 80 mg tablets as well as to 4 x 40 mg for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2 below). Given the short halflife of elimination of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Therefore, there is an increased risk of adverse events with rectal administration. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Figure, Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. However, the peak plasma concentration of oxycodone increased by 25 when a <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg Tablet was administered with a highfat meal., Distribution Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk (see PRECAUTIONS )., Metabolism Oxycodone hydrochloride is extensively metabolized to noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone, and their glucuronides. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation (to noroxycodone) is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation (to oxymorphone). Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions )., Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free oxycodone up to 19 conjugated oxycodone up to 50 free oxymorphone 0 conjugated oxymorphone  14 both free and conjugated noroxycodone have been found in the urine but not quantified. The total plasma clearance was 0.8 Lmin for adults., SAFETY AND HANDLING <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are solid dosage forms that contain oxycodone which is a controlled substance. Like morphine, oxycodone is controlled under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been targeted for theft and diversion by criminals.

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Serious adverse reactions which may be associated with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablet therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, and (to an even lesser degree) circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock (see OVERDOSAGE ). The nonserious adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are typical opioid side effects. These events are dosedependent, and their frequency depends upon the dose, the clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent (5) include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and asthenia. In many cases the frequency of these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large swings in the plasma concentrations of the opioid. Many of these adverse events will cease or decrease in intensity as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed. Clinical trials comparing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with immediaterelease oxycodone and placebo revealed a similar adverse event profile between <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and immediaterelease oxycodone. The most common adverse events (5) reported by patients at least once during therapy were TABLE 3 <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (n227) ImmediateRelease (n225) Placebo (n45) () () () Constipation (23) (26) (7) Nausea (23) (27) (11) Somnolence (23) (24) (4) Dizziness (13) (16) (9) Pruritus (13) (12) (2) Vomiting (12) (14) (7) Headache (7) (8) (7) Dry Mouth (6) (7) (2) Asthenia (6) (7)  Sweating (5) (6) (2) The following adverse experiences were reported in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>treated patients with an incidence between 1 and 5.

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to oxycodone, or in any situation where opioids are contraindicated. This includes patients with significant respiratory depression (in unmonitored settings or the absence of resuscitative equipment), and patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in any patient who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Principles <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO MORPHINE. OXYCODONE, LIKE MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN ANALGESIA, CAN BE ABUSED AND IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be started on the lowest appropriate dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiation of Therapy ). In treating pain it is vital to assess the patient regularly and systematically. Therapy should also be regularly reviewed and adjusted based upon the patients own reports of pain and side effects and the health professionals clinical judgment. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The controlledrelease nature of the formulation allows <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to be effectively administered every 12 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). While symmetric (same dose AM and PM), aroundtheclock, q12h dosing is appropriate for the majority of patients, some patients may benefit from asymmetric (different dose given in AM than in PM) dosing, tailored to their pain pattern. It is usually appropriate to treat a patient with only one opioid for aroundtheclock therapy. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING ). Initiation of Therapy It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior opioid and nonopioid analgesic treatment. Attention should be given to (1)the general condition and medical status of the patient (2)the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking (3)the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone (4)the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) (5)the Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg and (6)the balance between pain control and adverse experiences. Care should be taken to use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS DrugDrug Interactions ). For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios from Foley, KM. NEJM, 1985 3138495, found below, are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg q12h. If a nonopioid analgesic is being provided, it may be continued. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 4 below), multiply the mgday of the previous opioids by the appropriate multiplication factors to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. When converting from oxycodone, divide the 24hour oxycodone dose in half to obtain the twice a day (q12h) dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down to a dose which is appropriate for the tablet strengths available. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. The recommended doses shown in Table 4 are only a starting point, and close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 4. Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Prior Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (MgDay Prior Opioid x Factor  MgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Prior Opioid Parenteral Prior Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 In all cases, supplemental analgesia should be made available in the form of a suitable shortacting analgesic. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be safely used concomitantly with usual doses of nonopioid analgesics and analgesic adjuvants, provided care is taken to select a proper initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg q12h of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 ghr fentanyl transdermal patch. The patient should be followed closely for early titration, as there is very limited clinical experience with this conversion. Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Experiences Most patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative andor stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids. Other opioidrelated side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually selflimited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered. Patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence. Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose at each increase. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiverfamily. Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg Tablets or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg (for use in opioidtolerant patients only) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, are for use in opioidtolerant patients only. A single daily dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets. Supplemental Analgesia Most patients given aroundtheclock therapy with controlledrelease opioids may need to have immediaterelease medication available for exacerbations of pain or to prevent pain that occurs predictably during certain patient activities (incident pain). Maintenance of Therapy The intent of the titration period is to establish a patientspecific q12h dose that will maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects for as long as pain relief is necessary. Should pain recur then the dose can be incrementally increased to reestablish pain control. The method of therapy adjustment outlined above should be employed to reestablish pain control. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, conservative dose conversion ratios should be followed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a full muagonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive use, use for nonmedical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, has been diverted for nonmedical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> consists of a dualpolymer matrix, intended for oral use only. Abuse of the crushed tablet poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients, especially talc, can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard from oxycodone, the active ingredient in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as with all opioid agonists. Respiratory depression is a particular problem in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative nonopioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphinetype, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery.</td></tr>

A single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been reported as being abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death (see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ). Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Oxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure agonist opioid whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonistantagonists or nonopioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdose (See OVERDOSAGE ). Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for analgesia will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Experience Relationships <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are associated with typical opioidrelated adverse experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse experiences such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant. As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL TRIALS A doubleblind placebocontrolled, fixeddose, parallel group, twoweek study was conducted in 133 patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain, who were judged as having inadequate pain control with their current therapy. In this study, 20 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h but not 10 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h decreased pain compared with placebo, and this difference was statistically significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects., Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of oxycodone overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 40 mg and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) Single dose 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites (a and soxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics Avoid use with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS because they may reduce analgesic effect of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.4) 7.1 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, or death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4). 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 2D6 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could me more pronounced with concomitant use of CYP2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 7.4 Mixed AgonistAntagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. 7.5 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Opioids may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention andor severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS contain oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be abused and are subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The high drug content in extendedrelease formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. 9.2 Abuse All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuseand addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Drug abuse is the intentional nontherapeutic use of an overthecounter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug abuse includes, but is not limited to, the following examples the use of a prescription or overthecounter drug to get high, or the use of steroids for performance enhancement and muscle build up. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.Drugseeking behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s).Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to reduce abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are for oral use only. Abuse of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS pose a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. With parenteral abuse, the inactive ingredients in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV.. Abuse Deterrence Studies OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are formulated with inactive ingredients intended to make the tablet more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. For the purposes of describing the results of studies of the abusedeterrent characteristics of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS resulting from a change in formulation, in this section, the original formulation of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, which is no longer marketed, will be referred to as original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and the reformulated, currently marketed product will be referred to as OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS". In Vitro Testing In vitro physical and chemical tablet manipulation studies were performed to evaluate the success of different extraction methods in defeating the extendedrelease formulation. Results support that, relative to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, there is an increase in the ability of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to resist crushing, breaking, and dissolution using a variety of tools and solvents. The results of these studies also support this finding for OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to an immediaterelease oxycodone. When subjected to an aqueous environment, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS gradually form a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle. Clinical Studies In a randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled 5period crossover pharmacodynamic study, 30 recreational opioid users with a history of intranasal drug abuse received intranasally administered active and placebo drug treatments. The five treatment arms were finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 30 mg tablets, coarsely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 30 mg tablets, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, powdered oxycodone HCl 30 mg, and placebo. Data for finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, and powdered oxycodone HCl are described below. Drug liking was measured on a bipolar drug liking scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response of neither liking nor disliking, 0 represents maximum disliking and 100 represents maximum liking. Response to whether the subject would take the study drug again was also measured on a bipolar scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response, 0 represents the strongest negative response (definitely would not take drug again) and 100 represents the strongest positive response (definitely would take drug again). Twentyseven of the subjects completed the study. Incomplete dosing due to granules falling from the subjects nostrils occurred in 34 (n  10) of subjects with finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, compared with 7 (n  2) of subjects with finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and no subjects with powdered oxycodone HCl. The intranasal administration of finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was associated with a numerically lower mean and median drug liking score and a lower mean and median score for take drug again, compared to finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or powdered oxycodone HCl as summarized in Table 2.. Table 2 Summary of Maximum Drug Liking (Emax) Data Following Intranasal Administration  Bipolar scales (0  maximum negative response, 50  neutral response, 100  maximum positive response) VAS Scale (100 mm) OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (finely crushed) Original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (finely crushed) Oxycodone HCl (powdered) Drug Liking Mean (SE) 80.4 (3.9) 94.0 (2.7) 89.3 (3.1) Median (Range) 88 (36100) 100 (51100) 100 (50100) Take Drug Again Mean (SE) 64.0 (7.1) 89.6 (3.9) 86.6 (4.4) Median (Range) 78 (0100) 100 (20100) 100 (0100) Figure 1 demonstrates a comparison of drug liking for finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to powdered oxycodone HCl in subjects who received both treatments. The Yaxis represents the percent of subjects attaining a percent reduction in drug liking for OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS vs. oxycodone HCl powder greater than or equal to the value on the Xaxis. Approximately 44 (n  12) had no reduction in liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to oxycodone HCl. Approximately 56 (n  15) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to oxycodone HCl. Thirtythree percent (n  9) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30 in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to oxycodone HCl, and approximately 22 (n  6) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50 in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to oxycodone HCl..

Approximately 43 (n  12) of subjects had no reduction in liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Approximately 57 (n  16) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking, 36 (n  10) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30 in drug liking, and approximately 29 (n  8) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50 in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Summary The in vitro data demonstrate that OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS have physicochemical properties expected to make abuse via injection difficult. The data from the clinical study, along with support from the in vitro, data, also indicate that OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS have physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce abuse via the intranasal route. However, abuse of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS by these routes, as well as by the oral route, is still possible. Additional data, including epidemiological data, when available, may provide further information on the impact of the current formulation of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS on the abuse liability of the drug. Accordingly, this section may be updated in the future as appropriate. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS contain oxycodone, an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be abused and are subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1) graph Section 9.1 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.4). If OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are abruptly discontinued in a physicallydependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs see Use in Specific Populations (8.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. (2.1) For opioidnave and opioid nontolerant patients, initiate with 10 mg tablets orally every 12 hours. (2.1) Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in a physically dependent patient. (2.4) Tablets must be swallowed intact and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.5, 5.1) OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.5, 5.9, 17) 2.1 Initial Dosing OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) . Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ). OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . Crushing, chewing, or dissolving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) . Use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate treatment with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS with one 10 mg tablet orally every 12 hours. Use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg orally every 12 hours. Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Conversion from other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS by administering onehalf of the patients total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours. Conversion from other Opioids to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS defined by clinical trials. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg orally every 12 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patients 24hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediaterelease opioid) than to overestimate the 24hour oral oxycodone requirements which could result in adverse reactions. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial interpatient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products. Conversion from Methadone to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long halflife and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.2 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiverfamily during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediaterelease analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS dose. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioidrelated adverse reactions. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 2.4 Discontinuation of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS When the patient no longer requires therapy with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS tablets, use a gradual downward titration of the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. 2.5 Administration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Instruct patients to swallow OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Instruct patients to take OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS one tablet at a time and with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Patient Counseling Information (17)."</td></tr>

The safety of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock see Overdosage (10). The most common adverse reactions (5) reported by patients in clinical trials comparing OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS with placebo are shown in Table 1 below TABLE 1 Common Adverse Reactions (5) Adverse Reaction OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (n227) Placebo (n45) () () Constipation (23) (7) Nausea (23) (11) Somnolence (23) (4) Dizziness (13) (9) Pruritus (13) (2) Vomiting (12) (7) Headache (7) (7) Dry Mouth (6) (2) Asthenia (6)  Sweating (5) (2) In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS with an incidence between 1 and 5 Gastrointestinal disorders abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastritis General disorders and administration site conditions chills, fever Metabolism and nutrition disorders anorexia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders twitching Psychiatric disorders abnormal dreams, anxiety, confusion, dysphoria, euphoria, insomnia, nervousness, thought abnormalities Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders dyspnea, hiccups Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders rash Vascular disorders postural hypotension The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1 of patients involved in clinical trials Blood and lymphatic system disorders lymphadenopathy Ear and labyrinth disorders tinnitus Eye disorders abnormal vision Gastrointestinal disorders dysphagia, eructation, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, increased appetite, stomatitis General disorders and administration site conditions withdrawal syndrome (with and without seizures), edema, peripheral edema, thirst, malaise, chest pain, facial edema Injury, poisoning and procedural complications accidental injury Investigations ST depression Metabolism and nutrition disorders dehydration Nervous system disorders syncope, migraine, abnormal gait, amnesia, hyperkinesia, hypesthesia, hypotonia, paresthesia, speech disorder, stupor, tremor, vertigo, taste perversion Psychiatric disorders depression, agitation, depersonalization, emotional lability, hallucination Renal and urinary disorders dysuria, hematuria, polyuria, urinary retention Reproductive system and breast disorders impotence Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders cough increased, voice alteration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders dry skin, exfoliative dermatitis 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of controlledrelease oxycodone abuse, addiction, amenorrhea, cholestasis, death, dental caries, increased hepatic enzymes, hyperalgesia, hypogonadism, hyponatremia, ileus, muscular hypertonia, overdose, palpitations (in the context of withdrawal), seizures, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and urticaria. Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention. In addition to the events listed above, the following have also been reported, potentially due to the swelling and hydrogelling property of the tablet choking, gagging, regurgitation, tablets stuck in the throat and difficulty swallowing the tablet.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone hydrochloride is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics using OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1) 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 40 mg and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) Single dose 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites (a and soxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers Oxycodone has been detected in human milk. Closely monitor infants of nursing women receiving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. (8.3) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Do not initiate OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal signs can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, opioidnave females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>"10 OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be administered as directed in the products prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics using OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression and death. If coadminstration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs. (5.4) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease Monitor closely because of increased risk for lifethreatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effects Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.7) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.9) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects. (5.14) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ). As modifiedrelease products such as OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patients risk for opioid addiction, abuse or misuse prior to prescribing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, and monitor all patients receiving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modifiedrelease opioid formulations such as OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death see Overdosage ( 10 ). Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug see Patient Counseling Information (17). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 LifeThreatening Respiratory Depression Serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modifiedrelease opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status see Overdosage ( 10 ) . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioidinduced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are essential see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) . Overestimating the OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension and profound sedation, coma, or respiratory depression may result if OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are used concomitantly with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patients response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patients use of alcohol or illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy is made, start with 13 to 12 the usual dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.2). 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Lifethreatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and when OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve,hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients if possible.. 5.7 Hypotensive Effects OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) see Drug Interactions (7.1). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In patients with circulatory shock, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase.. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In these patients, mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, gradually taper the dose see Dosage and Administration (2.4). Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid effects. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for opioids or opiates detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified cutoff value as negative. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS GeneralOpioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. The administration of oxycodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Interactions with other CNS Depressants<b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used with caution and started in a reduced dosage (13 to 12 of the usual dosage) in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid AnalgesicsAgonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for preemptive analgesia (administration preoperatively for the management of postoperative pain). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting has not been established. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the postoperative period if the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (See American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented. Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract DiseaseOxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level. Tolerance and Physical DependenceTolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy )."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, ARE FOR USE IN OPIOIDTOLERANT PATIENTS ONLY. A single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of OpioidsOxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been reported as being abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death (see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ). Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of AbuseOxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Serious adverse reactions which may be associated with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablet therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, and (to an even lesser degree) circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock (see OVERDOSAGE ). The nonserious adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are typical opioid side effects. These events are dosedependent, and their frequency depends upon the dose, the clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent (5) include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and asthenia. In many cases the frequency of these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large swings in the plasma concentrations of the opioid. Many of these adverse events will cease or decrease in intensity as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed. Clinical trials comparing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with immediaterelease oxycodone and placebo revealed a similar adverse event profile between <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and immediaterelease oxycodone. The most common adverse events (5) reported by patients at least once during therapy were The following adverse experiences were reported in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>treated patients with an incidence between 1 and 5. In descending order of frequency they were anorexia, nervousness, insomnia, fever, confusion, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, rash, anxiety, euphoria, dyspnea, postural hypotension, chills, twitching, gastritis, abnormal dreams, thought abnormalities, and hiccups. The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1 of patients involved in clinical trials or were reported in postmarketing experience.

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>DESCRIPTION<b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease) Tablets are an opioid analgesic supplied in 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for oral administration</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Principles <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO MORPHINE. OXYCODONE, LIKE MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN ANALGESIA, CAN BE ABUSED AND IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be started on the lowest appropriate dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiation of Therapy ). In treating pain it is vital to assess the patient regularly and systematically. Therapy should also be regularly reviewed and adjusted based upon the patients own reports of pain and side effects and the health professionals clinical judgment. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The controlledrelease nature of the formulation allows <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to be effectively administered every 12 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). While symmetric (same dose AM and PM), aroundtheclock, q12h dosing is appropriate for the majority of patients, some patients may benefit from asymmetric (different dose given in AM than in PM) dosing, tailored to their pain pattern. It is usually appropriate to treat a patient with only one opioid for aroundtheclock therapy. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING ). Initiation of TherapyIt is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior opioid and nonopioid analgesic treatment. Attention should be given to(1)the general condition and medical status of the patient(2)the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking(3)the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone(4)the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any)(5)the Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg and (6)the balance between pain control and adverse experiences. Care should be taken to use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS DrugDrug Interactions ). For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios from Foley, KM. NEJM, 1985 3138495, found below, are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg q12h. If a nonopioid analgesic is being provided, it may be continued. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 4 below), multiply the mgday of the previous opioids by the appropriate multiplication factors to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. When converting from oxycodone, divide the 24hour oxycodone dose in half to obtain the twice a day (q12h) dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down to a dose which is appropriate for the tablet strengths available. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. The recommended doses shown in Table 4 are only a starting point, and close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. In all cases, supplemental analgesia should be made available in the form of a suitable shortacting analgesic. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be safely used concomitantly with usual doses of nonopioid analgesics and analgesic adjuvants, provided care is taken to select a proper initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg q12h of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 ghr fentanyl transdermal patch. The patient should be followed closely for early titration, as there is very limited clinical experience with this conversion. Managing Expected Opioid Adverse ExperiencesMost patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative andor stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids. Other opioidrelated side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually selflimited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered. Patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence. Individualization of DosageOnce therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose at each increase. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiverfamily. Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg Tablets or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg (for use in opioidtolerant patients only) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, are for use in opioidtolerant patients only. A single daily dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets. Supplemental AnalgesiaMost patients given aroundtheclock therapy with controlledrelease opioids may need to have immediaterelease medication available for exacerbations of pain or to prevent pain that occurs predictably during certain patient activities (incident pain). Maintenance of TherapyThe intent of the titration period is to establish a patientspecific q12h dose that will maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects for as long as pain relief is necessary. Should pain recur then the dose can be incrementally increased to reestablish pain control. The method of therapy adjustment outlined above should be employed to reestablish pain control. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. Cessation of TherapyWhen the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral OpioidsTo avoid overdose, conservative dose conversion ratios should be followed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure agonist opioid whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonistantagonists or nonopioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. Central Nervous SystemThe precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdose (See OVERDOSAGE ). Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth MuscleOxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular SystemOxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Concentration  Efficacy RelationshipsStudies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for analgesia will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Experience Relationships<b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are associated with typical opioidrelated adverse experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse experiences such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant. As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg for use in opioidtolerant patients only WARNING <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are NOT intended for use as a prn analgesic. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, ARE FOR USE IN OPIOIDTOLERANT PATIENTS ONLY. A single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGEAcute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of oxycodone overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are designed to provide controlled delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Breaking, chewing or crushing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets eliminates the controlled delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is pH independent. Oxycodone is well absorbed from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets with an oral bioavailability of 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing in normal volunteers in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Dose proportionality andor bioavailability has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC). Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. The administration of oxycodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Interactions with other CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used with caution and started in a reduced dosage (13 to 12 of the usual dosage) in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for preemptive analgesia (administration preoperatively for the management of postoperative pain). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting has not been established. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the postoperative period if the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (See American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented. Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level. Tolerance and Physical Dependence Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy ). Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver Patients should be aware that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets will release all their contents at once if broken, chewed, or crushed, resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> without consulting the prescribing professional. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. Patients should be instructed to keep <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a secure place out of the reach of children. When <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addictive disorders. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence, either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Although clinical studies have not been conducted, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inducers of CYP3A4 Although clinical studies have not been conducted, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug, which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy, or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inducers. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance with this agent. Clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction, however. Use with CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies of oxycodone to evaluate its carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Oxycodone was not mutagenic in the following assays Ames Salmonella and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at doses of up to 5000 g, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes in the absence of metabolic activation at doses of up to 1500 gmL and with activation 48 hours after exposure at doses of up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in mice (at plasma levels of up to 48 gmL). Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation in the human chromosomal aberration test (at greater than or equal to 1250 gmL) at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure and in the mouse lymphoma assay at doses of 50 gmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 gmL or greater without metabolic activation. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively. These doses are 3 and 46 times a human dose of 160 mgday, based on mgkg basis. The results did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery. Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of oxycodone have been detected in breast milk. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because of the possibility of sedation andor respiratory depression in the infant. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18. It must be remembered that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets cannot be crushed or divided for administration. Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Laboratory Monitoring Due to the broad range of plasma concentrations seen in clinical populations, the varying degrees of pain, and the development of tolerance, plasma oxycodone measurements are usually not helpful in clinical management. Plasma concentrations of the active drug substance may be of value in selected, unusual or complex cases. Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment indicates greater plasma concentrations than those with normal function. The initiation of therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and careful dose titration is warranted. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. Dosages should be adjusted according to the clinical situation. Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation and in theory can be affected by drugs affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes. Oxycodone is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 to oxymorphone which represents less than 15 of the total administered dose. This route of elimination may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants). However, in a study involving 10 subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged., DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Although clinical studies have not been conducted, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inducers of CYP3A4 Although clinical studies have not been conducted, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug, which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy, or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inducers. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance with this agent. Clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction, however.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. In normal volunteers, the t of absorption is 0.4 hours for immediaterelease oral oxycodone. In contrast, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets exhibit a biphasic absorption pattern with two apparent absorption halflives of 0.6 and 6.9 hours, which describes the initial release of oxycodone from the tablet followed by a prolonged release., Plasma Oxycodone by Time Dose proportionality has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 1 below). Another study established that the 160 mg tablet is bioequivalent to 2 x 80 mg tablets as well as to 4 x 40 mg for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2 below). Given the short halflife of elimination of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets.

Therefore, there is an increased risk of adverse events with rectal administration. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Figure, Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. However, the peak plasma concentration of oxycodone increased by 25 when a <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg Tablet was administered with a highfat meal., Distribution Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk (see PRECAUTIONS )., Metabolism Oxycodone hydrochloride is extensively metabolized to noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone, and their glucuronides. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation (to noroxycodone) is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation (to oxymorphone). Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions )., Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free oxycodone up to 19 conjugated oxycodone up to 50 free oxymorphone 0 conjugated oxymorphone  14 both free and conjugated noroxycodone have been found in the urine but not quantified. The total plasma clearance was 0.8 Lmin for adults., SAFETY AND HANDLING <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are solid dosage forms that contain oxycodone which is a controlled substance. Like morphine, oxycodone is controlled under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been targeted for theft and diversion by criminals.

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Serious adverse reactions which may be associated with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablet therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, and (to an even lesser degree) circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock (see OVERDOSAGE ). The nonserious adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are typical opioid side effects. These events are dosedependent, and their frequency depends upon the dose, the clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent (5) include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and asthenia. In many cases the frequency of these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large swings in the plasma concentrations of the opioid. Many of these adverse events will cease or decrease in intensity as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed. Clinical trials comparing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with immediaterelease oxycodone and placebo revealed a similar adverse event profile between <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and immediaterelease oxycodone.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Principles <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO MORPHINE. OXYCODONE, LIKE MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN ANALGESIA, CAN BE ABUSED AND IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be started on the lowest appropriate dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiation of Therapy ). In treating pain it is vital to assess the patient regularly and systematically. Therapy should also be regularly reviewed and adjusted based upon the patients own reports of pain and side effects and the health professionals clinical judgment. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The controlledrelease nature of the formulation allows <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to be effectively administered every 12 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). While symmetric (same dose AM and PM), aroundtheclock, q12h dosing is appropriate for the majority of patients, some patients may benefit from asymmetric (different dose given in AM than in PM) dosing, tailored to their pain pattern. It is usually appropriate to treat a patient with only one opioid for aroundtheclock therapy. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING ). Initiation of Therapy It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior opioid and nonopioid analgesic treatment. Attention should be given to (1)the general condition and medical status of the patient (2)the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking (3)the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone (4)the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) (5)the Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg and (6)the balance between pain control and adverse experiences. Care should be taken to use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS DrugDrug Interactions ). For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios from Foley, KM. NEJM, 1985 3138495, found below, are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg q12h. If a nonopioid analgesic is being provided, it may be continued. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 4 below), multiply the mgday of the previous opioids by the appropriate multiplication factors to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. When converting from oxycodone, divide the 24hour oxycodone dose in half to obtain the twice a day (q12h) dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down to a dose which is appropriate for the tablet strengths available. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. The recommended doses shown in Table 4 are only a starting point, and close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 4. Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Prior Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (MgDay Prior Opioid x Factor  MgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Prior Opioid Parenteral Prior Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 In all cases, supplemental analgesia should be made available in the form of a suitable shortacting analgesic. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be safely used concomitantly with usual doses of nonopioid analgesics and analgesic adjuvants, provided care is taken to select a proper initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg q12h of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 ghr fentanyl transdermal patch. The patient should be followed closely for early titration, as there is very limited clinical experience with this conversion. Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Experiences Most patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative andor stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids. Other opioidrelated side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually selflimited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered. Patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence. Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose at each increase. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiverfamily. Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg Tablets or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg (for use in opioidtolerant patients only) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, are for use in opioidtolerant patients only. A single daily dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets. Supplemental Analgesia Most patients given aroundtheclock therapy with controlledrelease opioids may need to have immediaterelease medication available for exacerbations of pain or to prevent pain that occurs predictably during certain patient activities (incident pain). Maintenance of Therapy The intent of the titration period is to establish a patientspecific q12h dose that will maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects for as long as pain relief is necessary. Should pain recur then the dose can be incrementally increased to reestablish pain control. The method of therapy adjustment outlined above should be employed to reestablish pain control. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, conservative dose conversion ratios should be followed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a full muagonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive use, use for nonmedical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, has been diverted for nonmedical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> consists of a dualpolymer matrix, intended for oral use only. Abuse of the crushed tablet poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients, especially talc, can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard from oxycodone, the active ingredient in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as with all opioid agonists. Respiratory depression is a particular problem in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative nonopioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphinetype, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery.</td></tr>

Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been reported as being abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product.

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure agonist opioid whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonistantagonists or nonopioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdose (See OVERDOSAGE ). Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for analgesia will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Experience Relationships <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are associated with typical opioidrelated adverse experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse experiences such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant. As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL TRIALS A doubleblind placebocontrolled, fixeddose, parallel group, twoweek study was conducted in 133 patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain, who were judged as having inadequate pain control with their current therapy. In this study, 20 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h but not 10 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h decreased pain compared with placebo, and this difference was statistically significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects., Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of oxycodone overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.</td></tr>

Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.

Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics Avoid use with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because they may reduce analgesic effect of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.4) 7.1 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, or death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4). 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 2D6 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could me more pronounced with concomitant use of CYP2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 7.4 Mixed AgonistAntagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 7.5 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Opioids may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention andor severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The high drug content in extendedrelease formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. 9.2 Abuse All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Drug abuse is the intentional nontherapeutic use of an overthecounter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug abuse includes, but is not limited to, the following examples the use of a prescription or overthecounter drug to get high, or the use of steroids for performance enhancement and muscle build up. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to reduce abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is for oral use only. Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. With parenteral abuse, the inactive ingredients in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Abuse Deterrence Studies <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is formulated with inactive ingredients intended to make the tablet more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. For the purposes of describing the results of studies of the abusedeterrent characteristics of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> resulting from a change in formulation, in this section, the original formulation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, which is no longer marketed, will be referred to as original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and the reformulated, currently marketed product will be referred to as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>". In Vitro Testing In vitro physical and chemical tablet manipulation studies were performed to evaluate the success of different extraction methods in defeating the extendedrelease formulation. Results support that, relative to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, there is an increase in the ability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to resist crushing, breaking, and dissolution using a variety of tools and solvents. The results of these studies also support this finding for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> relative to an immediaterelease oxycodone. When subjected to an aqueous environment, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle. Clinical Studies In a randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled 5period crossover pharmacodynamic study, 30 recreational opioid users with a history of intranasal drug abuse received intranasally administered active and placebo drug treatments. The five treatment arms were finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, coarsely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, powdered oxycodone HCl 30 mg, and placebo. Data for finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, and powdered oxycodone HCl are described below. Drug liking was measured on a bipolar drug liking scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response of neither liking nor disliking, 0 represents maximum disliking and 100 represents maximum liking. Response to whether the subject would take the study drug again was also measured on a bipolar scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response, 0 represents the strongest negative response (definitely would not take drug again) and 100 represents the strongest positive response (definitely would take drug again). Twentyseven of the subjects completed the study. Incomplete dosing due to granules falling from the subjects nostrils occurred in 34 (n  10) of subjects with finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, compared with 7 (n  2) of subjects with finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and no subjects with powdered oxycodone HCl. The intranasal administration of finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was associated with a numerically lower mean and median drug liking score and a lower mean and median score for take drug again, compared to finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or powdered oxycodone HCl as summarized in Table 2.

Approximately 43 (n  12) of subjects had no reduction in liking with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> relative to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Approximately 57 (n  16) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking, 36 (n  10) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30 in drug liking, and approximately 29 (n  8) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50 in drug liking with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> compared to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Summary The in vitro data demonstrate that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has physicochemical properties expected to make abuse via injection difficult. The data from the clinical study, along with support from the in vitro data, also indicate that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce abuse via the intranasal route. However, abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by these routes, as well as by the oral route, is still possible. Additional data, including epidemiological data, when available, may provide further information on the impact of the current formulation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> on the abuse liability of the drug. Accordingly, this section may be updated in the future as appropriate. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1). 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.4). If <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abruptly discontinued in a physicallydependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs see Use in Specific Populations (8.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. (2.1) For opioidnave and opioid nontolerant patients, initiate with 10 mg tablets orally every 12 hours. (2.1) Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a physically dependent patient. (2.4) Tablets must be swallowed intact and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.5, 5.1) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.5, 5.9, 17) 2.1 Initial Dosing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information (17). Crushing, chewing, or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with one 10 mg tablet orally every 12 hours. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg orally every 12 hours. Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Conversion from other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by administering onehalf of the patients total daily oral oxycodone dose as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours. Conversion from other Opioids to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> defined by clinical trials. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg orally every 12 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patients 24hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediaterelease opioid) than to overestimate the 24hour oral oxycodone requirements which could result in adverse reactions. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial interpatient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products. Conversion from Methadone to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long halflife and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.2 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiverfamily during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediaterelease analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioidrelated adverse reactions. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 2.4 Discontinuation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets, use a gradual downward titration of the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 2.5 Administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Instruct patients to swallow <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Instruct patients to take <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> one tablet at a time and with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Patient Counseling Information (17)."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone hydrochloride is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers Oxycodone has been detected in human milk. Closely monitor infants of nursing women receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. (8.3) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Do not initiate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal signs can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, opioidnave females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be administered as directed in the products prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression and death. If coadminstration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs. (5.4) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease Monitor closely because of increased risk for lifethreatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effects Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.7) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.9) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects. (5.14) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9). As modifiedrelease products such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9). Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patients risk for opioid addiction, abuse or misuse prior to prescribing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, and monitor all patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modifiedrelease opioid formulations such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death see Overdosage (10). Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug see Patient Counseling Information (17). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 LifeThreatening Respiratory Depression Serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modifiedrelease opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status see Overdosage (10). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioidinduced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are essential see Dosage and Administration (2). Overestimating the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension and profound sedation, coma, or respiratory depression may result if <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concomitantly with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patients response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patients use of alcohol or illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is made, start with 13 to 12 the usual dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.2). 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Lifethreatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Hypotensive Effects <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) see Drug Interactions (7.1). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In patients with circulatory shock, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In these patients, mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, gradually taper the dose see Dosage and Administration (2.4). Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid effects. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for opioids or opiates detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified cutoff value as negative. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are designed to provide controlled delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets eliminates the controlled delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is pH independent. Oxycodone is well absorbed from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets with an oral bioavailability of 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing in normal volunteers in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Dose proportionality andor bioavailability has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC). Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. In normal volunteers, the t of absorption is 0.4 hours for immediaterelease oral oxycodone. In contrast, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets exhibit a biphasic absorption pattern with two apparent absorption halflives of 0.6 and 6.9 hours, which describes the initial release of oxycodone from the tablet followed by a prolonged release. Plasma Oxycodone by Time Dose proportionality has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 1 below). Another study established that the 160 mg tablet is bioequivalent to 2 x 80 mg tablets as well as to 4 x 40 mg for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2 below). Given the short halflife of elimination of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Data from a study involving 21 normal volunteers show that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets administered per rectum resulted in an AUC 39 greater and a Cmax 9 higher than tablets administered by mouth. Therefore, there is an increased risk of adverse events with rectal administration. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Figure Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. However, the peak plasma concentration of oxycodone increased by 25 when a <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg Tablet was administered with a highfat meal. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk (see PRECAUTIONS ). Metabolism Oxycodone hydrochloride is extensively metabolized to noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone, and their glucuronides. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation (to noroxycodone) is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation (to oxymorphone). Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions ). Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free oxycodone up to 19 conjugated oxycodone up to 50 free oxymorphone 0 conjugated oxymorphone  14 both free and conjugated noroxycodone have been found in the urine but not quantified. The total plasma clearance was 0.8 Lmin for adults. Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ). DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation and can be affected by drugs affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxycodone is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 to oxymorphone which represents less than 15 of the total administered dose. This route of elimination may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants). However, in a study involving 10 subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone. Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. Twenty and 30 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> were superior in reducing pain compared with placebo, and this difference was statistically significant. The onset of analgesic action with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> occurred within 1 hour in most patients following oral administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. The administration of oxycodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Interactions with other CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used with caution and started in a reduced dosage (13 to 12 of the usual dosage) in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for preemptive analgesia (administration preoperatively for the management of postoperative pain). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting has not been established. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the postoperative period if the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (See American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented. Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level. Tolerance and Physical Dependence Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy ). Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients accordingly. Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver Patients should be aware that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets will release all their contents at once if cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> without consulting the prescribing professional. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. Patients should be instructed to keep <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a secure place out of the reach of children. When <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addictive disorders. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence, either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. A published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Although clinical studies have not been conducted with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug, which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy, or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inducers. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance during oxycodone treatment. Use with CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies of oxycodone to evaluate its carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Oxycodone was not mutagenic in the following assays Ames Salmonella and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at doses of up to 5000 g, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes in the absence of metabolic activation at doses of up to 1500 gmL and with activation 48 hours after exposure at doses of up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in mice (at plasma levels of up to 48 gmL). Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation in the human chromosomal aberration test (at greater than or equal to 1250 gmL) at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure and in the mouse lymphoma assay at doses of 50 gmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 gmL or greater without metabolic activation. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively. These doses are 3 and 46 times a human dose of 160 mgday, based on mgkg basis. The results did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery. Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of oxycodone have been detected in breast milk. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because of the possibility of sedation andor respiratory depression in the infant. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18. It must be remembered that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets cannot be crushed or divided for administration. Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Laboratory Monitoring Due to the broad range of plasma concentrations seen in clinical populations, the varying degrees of pain, and the development of tolerance, plasma oxycodone measurements are usually not helpful in clinical management. Plasma concentrations of the active drug substance may be of value in selected, unusual or complex cases. Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment indicates greater plasma concentrations than those with normal function. The initiation of therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and careful dose titration is warranted. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. Dosages should be adjusted according to the clinical situation. Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation and can be affected by drugs affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxycodone is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 to oxymorphone which represents less than 15 of the total administered dose. This route of elimination may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants). However, in a study involving 10 subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone., DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Principles <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO MORPHINE. OXYCODONE, LIKE MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN ANALGESIA, CAN BE ABUSED AND IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissloved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be started on the lowest appropriate dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiation of Therapy ). In treating pain it is vital to assess the patient regularly and systematically. Therapy should also be regularly reviewed and adjusted based upon the patients own reports of pain and side effects and the health professionals clinical judgment. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The controlledrelease nature of the formulation allows <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to be effectively administered every 12 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). While symmetric (same dose AM and PM), aroundtheclock, q12h dosing is appropriate for the majority of patients, some patients may benefit from asymmetric (different dose given in AM than in PM) dosing, tailored to their pain pattern. It is usually appropriate to treat a patient with only one opioid for aroundtheclock therapy. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING ). Initiation of Therapy It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior opioid and nonopioid analgesic treatment. Attention should be given to (1)risk factors for abuse or addiction including whether the patient has a previous or current substance abuse problem, a family history of substance abuse, or a history of mental illness or depression (2)the age, general condition and medical status of the patient (3)the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking (4)the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone (5)the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) (6)the Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg and (7)the balance between pain control and adverse experiences. Care should be taken to use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS DrugDrug Interactions ). For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios from Foley, KM. NEJM, 1985 3138495, found below, are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg q12h. If a nonopioid analgesic is being provided, it may be continued. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 4 below), multiply the mgday of the previous opioids by the appropriate multiplication factors to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. When converting from oxycodone, divide the 24hour oxycodone dose in half to obtain the twice a day (q12h) dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down to a dose which is appropriate for the tablet strengths available. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. The recommended doses shown in Table 4 are only a starting point, and close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 4. Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Prior Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (MgDay Prior Opioid x Factor  MgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Prior Opioid Parenteral Prior Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 In all cases, supplemental analgesia should be made available in the form of a suitable shortacting analgesic. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be safely used concomitantly with usual doses of nonopioid analgesics and analgesic adjuvants, provided care is taken to select a proper initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg q12h of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 ghr fentanyl transdermal patch. The patient should be followed closely for early titration, as there is very limited clinical experience with this conversion. Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Experiences Most patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative andor stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids. Other opioidrelated side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually selflimited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered. Patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence. Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose at each increase. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiverfamily. Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg (for use in opioidtolerant patients only) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in opioidtolerant patients, as they may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratorydepressant, or sedating effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets. Supplemental Analgesia Most patients given aroundtheclock therapy with controlledrelease opioids may need to have immediaterelease medication available for exacerbations of pain or to prevent pain that occurs predictably during certain patient activities (incident pain). Maintenance of Therapy The intent of the titration period is to establish a patientspecific q12h dose that will maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects for as long as pain relief is necessary. Should pain recur then the dose can be incrementally increased to reestablish pain control. The method of therapy adjustment outlined above should be employed to reestablish pain control. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, conservative dose conversion ratios should be followed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a full muagonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive use, use for nonmedical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, has been diverted for nonmedical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> consists of a dualpolymer matrix, intended for oral use only. Abuse of the crushed tablet poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients, especially talc, can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard from oxycodone, the active ingredient in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as with all opioid agonists. Respiratory depression is a particular problem in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative nonopioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphinetype, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in opioidtolerant patients, as they may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been reported as being abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death (see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ). Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Oxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Serious adverse reactions which may be associated with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablet therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, and (to an even lesser degree) circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock (see OVERDOSAGE ). The nonserious adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are typical opioid side effects. These events are dosedependent, and their frequency depends upon the dose, the clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent (5) include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and asthenia. In many cases the frequency of these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large swings in the plasma concentrations of the opioid. Many of these adverse events will cease or decrease in intensity as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed. Clinical trials comparing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with immediaterelease oxycodone and placebo revealed a similar adverse event profile between <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and immediaterelease oxycodone.

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure agonist opioid whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonistantagonists or nonopioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdose (See OVERDOSAGE ). Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for analgesia will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Experience Relationships <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are associated with typical opioidrelated adverse experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse experiences such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant. As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects., Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of oxycodone overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.</td></tr>

Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3 Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC ( nghr mL) for singledose AUC  AUC0inf Cmax (ngmL) Tmax ( hr ) Single Dosedata obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics Avoid use with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS because they may reduce analgesic effect of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.4) 7.1 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, or death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4). 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 2D6 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could me more pronounced with concomitant use of CYP2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 7.4 Mixed AgonistAntagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. 7.5 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Opioids may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention andor severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.</td></tr>

OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be abused and are subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The high drug content in extendedrelease formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. 9.2 Abuse All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Drug abuse is the intentional nontherapeutic use of an overthecounter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug abuse includes, but is not limited to, the following examples the use of a prescription or overthecounter drug to get high, or the use of steroids for performance enhancement and muscle build up. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to reduce abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are for oral use only. Abuse of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS pose a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. With parenteral abuse, the inactive ingredients in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Abuse Deterrence Studies OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are formulated with inactive ingredients intended to make the tablet more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. For the purposes of describing the results of studies of the abusedeterrent characteristics of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS resulting from a change in formulation, in this section, the original formulation of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, which is no longer marketed, will be referred to as original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and the reformulated, currently marketed product will be referred to as OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In Vitro Testing In vitro physical and chemical tablet manipulation studies were performed to evaluate the success of different extraction methods in defeating the extendedrelease formulation. Results support that, relative to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, there is an increase in the ability of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to resist crushing, breaking, and dissolution using a variety of tools and solvents. The results of these studies also support this finding for OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to an immediaterelease oxycodone. When subjected to an aqueous environment, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle. Clinical Studies In a randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled 5period crossover pharmacodynamic study, 30 recreational opioid users with a history of intranasal drug abuse received intranasally administered active and placebo drug treatments. The five treatment arms were finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 30 mg tablets, coarsely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 30 mg tablets, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, powdered oxycodone HCl 30 mg, and placebo. Data for finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, and powdered oxycodone HCl are described below. Drug liking was measured on a bipolar drug liking scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response of neither liking nor disliking, 0 represents maximum disliking and 100 represents maximum liking. Response to whether the subject would take the study drug again was also measured on a bipolar scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response, 0 represents the strongest negative response (definitely would not take drug again) and 100 represents the strongest positive response (definitely would take drug again). Twentyseven of the subjects completed the study. Incomplete dosing due to granules falling from the subjects nostrils occurred in 34 (n  10) of subjects with finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, compared with 7 (n  2) of subjects with finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and no subjects with powdered oxycodone HCl. The intranasal administration of finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was associated with a numerically lower mean and median drug liking score and a lower mean and median score for take drug again, compared to finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or powdered oxycodone HCl as summarized in Table 2. Table 2 Summary of Maximum Drug Liking (Emax) Data Following Intranasal Administration VAS Scale (100 mm)Bipolar scales (0  maximum negative response, 50  neutral response, 100  maximum positive response) OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (finely crushed) Original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (finely crushed) Oxycodone HCl (powdered) Drug Liking Mean (SE) 80.4 (3.9) 94.0 (2.7) 89.3 (3.1) Median (Range) 88 (36100) 100 (51100) 100 (50100) Take Drug Again Mean (SE) 64.0 (7.1) 89.6 (3.9) 86.6 (4.4) Median (Range) 78 (0100) 100 (20100) 100 (0100) Figure 1 demonstrates a comparison of drug liking for finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to powdered oxycodone HCl in subjects who received both treatments. The Yaxis represents the percent of subjects attaining a percent reduction in drug liking for OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS vs. oxycodone HCl powder greater than or equal to the value on the Xaxis. Approximately 44 (n  12) had no reduction in liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to oxycodone HCl. Approximately 56 (n  15) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to oxycodone HCl. Thirtythree percent (n  9) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30 in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to oxycodone HCl, and approximately 22 (n  6) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50 in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to oxycodone HCl. Figure 1 Percent Reduction Profiles for Emax of Drug Liking VAS for OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS vs. oxycodone HCl , N27 Following Intranasal Administration The results of a similar analysis of drug liking for finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> were comparable to the results of finely crushed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to powdered oxycodone HCl. Approximately 43 (n  12) of subjects had no reduction in liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Approximately 57 (n  16) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking, 36 (n  10) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30 in drug liking, and approximately 29 (n  8) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50 in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Summary The in vitro data demonstrate that OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS have physicochemical properties expected to make abuse via injection difficult. The data from the clinical study, along with support from the in vitro data, also indicate that OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS have physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce abuse via the intranasal route. However, abuse of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS by these routes, as well as by the oral route, is still possible. Additional data, including epidemiological data, when available, may provide further information on the impact of the current formulation of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS on the abuse liability of the drug. Accordingly, this section may be updated in the future as appropriate. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS contain oxycodone, an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be abused and are subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1). Figure 1 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.4). If OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are abruptly discontinued in a physicallydependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs see Use in Specific Populations (8.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. (2.1) For opioidnave and opioid nontolerant patients, initiate with 10 mg tablets orally every 12 hours. (2.1) Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in a physically dependent patient. (2.4) Tablets must be swallowed intact and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.5, 5.1) OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.5, 5.9, 17) 2.1 Initial Dosing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphone day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information (17). Crushing, chewing, or dissolving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate treatment with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS with one 10 mg tablet orally every 12 hours. Use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg orally every 12 hours. Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Conversion from other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS by administering onehalf of the patients total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours. Conversion from other Opioids to OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS defined by clinical trials. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg orally every 12 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patients 24hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediaterelease opioid) than to overestimate the 24hour oral oxycodone requirements which could result in adverse reactions. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial interpatient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products. Conversion from Methadone to OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long halflife and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.2 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiverfamily during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediaterelease analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS dose. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioidrelated adverse reactions. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 2.4 Discontinuation of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS When the patient no longer requires therapy with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, use a gradual downward titration of the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. 2.5 Administration of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Instruct patients to swallow OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Instruct patients to take OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS one tablet at a time and with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Patient Counseling Information (17)."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone hydrochloride is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3 Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC ( nghr mL) for singledose AUC  AUC0inf Cmax (ngmL) Tmax ( hr ) Single Dosedata obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers Oxycodone has been detected in human milk. Closely monitor infants of nursing women receiving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. (8.3) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Do not initiate OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal signs can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, opioidnave females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be administered as directed in the products prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression and death. If coadminstration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs. (5.4) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease Monitor closely because of increased risk for lifethreatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effects Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.7) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.9) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects. (5.14) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS contain oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9). As modifiedrelease products such as OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9). Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patients risk for opioid addiction, abuse or misuse prior to prescribing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, and monitor all patients receiving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modifiedrelease opioid formulations such as OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death see Overdosage (10). Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug see Patient Counseling Information (17). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 LifeThreatening Respiratory Depression Serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modifiedrelease opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status see Overdosage ( 10 ) . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioidinduced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are essential see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) . Overestimating the OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension and profound sedation, coma, or respiratory depression may result if OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are used concomitantly with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patients response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patients use of alcohol or illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy is made, start with 13 to 12 the usual dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) . 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Lifethreatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and when OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) . 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale , and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Hypotensive Effects OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) see Drug Interactions (7.1). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In patients with circulatory shock, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine , nalbuphine , and butorphanol ) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In these patients, mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, gradually taper the dose see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) . Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid effects. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for opioids or opiates detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified cutoff value as negative. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 2.0 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone which can enhance absorption Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) Single Dose 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 15 mg 196 28 16.8 29 4.59 19 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 30 mg 377 24 34.6 21 4.61 19 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 60 mg 705 22 64.6 24 4.15 26 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly ( 65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Muscle relaxants Avoid use with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because of increased risk of respiratory depression. (7.2) The CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. (7.3) Mixed agonistantagonist opioid analgesics Avoid use with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because they may reduce analgesic effect of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.4) 7.1 CNS Depressants Concurrent use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression and hypotension. When such combined therapy is contemplated, start <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant. 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, significantly increased the plasma concentrations of oxycodone. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may prolong opioid effects. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inducers of CYP3A4 A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, significantly decreased plasma oxycodone concentrations. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance during oxycodone treatment. However, clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction. 7.4 Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should generally not be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 7.5 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Opioids may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention andor severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The high drug content in extendedrelease formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. 9.2 Abuse Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Drug abuse is the intentional nontherapeutic use of an overthecounter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug abuse includes, but is not limited to the following examples the use of a prescription or overthecounter drug to get high, or the use of steroids for performance enhancement and muscle build up. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. "Drug seeking" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to reduce abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is for oral use only. Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol and other substances. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> enhances drug release and increases the risk of over dose and death. Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, or mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.4). If <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abruptly discontinued in a physicallydependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs see Use in Specific Populations (8.9).</td></tr>

Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosing based on patients prior analgesic treatment experience, and titrate as needed to provide adequate analgesia and minimize adverse reactions. (2.1, 2.2) Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a physically dependent patient. (2.4) Tablets must be swallowed intact and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.5, 5.1) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.5, 5.9, 17) 2.1 Initial Dosing Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior analgesic treatment experience. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Consider the following factors when selecting an initial dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Total daily dose, potency, and any prior opioid the patient has been taking previously Reliability of the relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent dose of oxycodone needed (Note potency estimates may vary with the route of administration) Patients degree of opioid experience and opioid tolerance General condition and medical status of the patient Concurrent medication Type and severity of the patients pain. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate therapy with 10 mg every 12 hours. Conversion from other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by administering onehalf of the patients total daily oral oxycodone dose as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours. Conversion from other Opioids to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> While there are useful tables of oral and parenteral equivalents, there is substantial interpatient variation in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and formulations. Specific recommendations are not available because of a lack of systematic evidence for these types of analgesic substitutions. As such, it is safer to underestimate a patients 24hour oral oxycodone requirement and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediaterelease oxycodone) than to overestimate and precipitate an adverse reaction. In general, begin with half of the estimated daily oxycodone requirement as the initial dose, managing inadequate analgesia by supplementation with immediaterelease oxycodone. Published relative potency data are available and may be referred to in clinical practice guidelines such as those published by authorities in the field of pain medicine, but such ratios are approximations. Consider contacting your specific state medical or pharmacy professional societies for further information on how to safely convert patients from one opioid to another. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.2 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancerrelated pain (or pain associated with other terminal illnesses), periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. If the level of pain increases, attempt to identify the source of increased pain, while adjusting the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose to decrease the level of pain. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dosage adjustments may be done every 1 to 2 days. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediaterelease opioid and nonopioid medication. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the next dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioidrelated adverse reactions. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. During chronic, aroundtheclock opioid therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, reassess the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy regularly (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 2.4 Discontinuation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets, use a gradual downward titration of the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physicallydependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 2.5 Administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Instruct patients to swallow <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2). Instruct patients to take <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> one tablet at a time and with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), and Patient Counseling Information (17)."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients.</td></tr>

The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock see Overdosage (10).

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure mu receptor opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, hydrocodone and oxymorphone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Increasing doses of pure mu receptor agonists are associated with increasing analgesia. There is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by adverse reactions, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone which can enhance absorption Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) Single Dose 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 15 mg 196 28 16.8 29 4.59 19 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 30 mg 377 24 34.6 21 4.61 19 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 60 mg 705 22 64.6 24 4.15 26 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly ( 65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers Oxycodone has been detected in human milk. Closely monitor infants of nursing women receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. (8.3) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 2.0 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Do not initiate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal signs can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, opioidnave females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials. 8.9 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Chronic maternal use of oxycodone during pregnancy can affect the fetus with subsequent withdrawal signs. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration and severity of neonatal withdrawal syndrome vary based on the drug used, duration of use, the dose of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of drug by the newborn. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</td></tr>

Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6.

Assess each patients risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. The risk for opioid abuse is increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depressive disorder). Routinely monitor all patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction during treatment see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9).

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be administered as directed in the products prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients, and patients with chronic pulmonary disease Monitor closely because of increased risk of respiratory depression. (5.4, 5.5) Interaction with CNS depressants Consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive effects. (5.6, 7.1) Hypotensive effects Monitor during dose initiation and titration (5.7) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.9) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where there is concern about increased risks of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain. Assess each patients risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. The risk for opioid abuse is increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modifiedrelease opioid formulations however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because these drugs carry a risk for addiction even under appropriate medical use. Misuse or abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk that could result in overdose and death see Overdosage (10). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 LifeThreatening Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Respiratory depression if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a sighing pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioidinduced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status see Overdosage (10). While serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and following dose increases. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed and to keep <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> out of the reach of children, as such inappropriate use may result in fatal respiratory depression. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are essential see Dosage and Administration (2). Overestimating the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Respiratory depression has also been reported with use of modifiedrelease opioids when used as recommended and not misused or abused. To further reduce the risk of respiratory depression, consider the following Proper dosing and titration are essential and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets are for use in opioidtolerant patients only. Ingestion of these strengths of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients not already tolerant to high doses of opioids. Instruct patients to swallow <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed. The resulting oxycodone dose may be fatal, particularly in opioidnave individuals. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with respiratory depression and in patients with conditions that increase the risk of lifethreatening respiratory depression see Contraindications (4). 5.3 Accidental Exposure Accidental ingestion of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Therefore, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). 5.5 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Interactions with Alcohol, CNS Depressants, and Illicit Drugs Hypotension, and profound sedation, coma or respiratory depression may result if <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concomitantly with other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, muscle relaxants, other opioids). When considering the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patients response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, consider the patients use, if any, of alcohol andor illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is to be initiated in a patient taking a CNS depressant, start with a lower <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose than usual and monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant see Drug Interactions (7.1). 5.7 Hypotensive Effects <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) see Drug Interactions (7.1). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In patients with circulatory shock, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In these patients, mixed agonistsantagonists analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, gradually taper the dose see Dosage and Administration (2.4). Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid effects. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.3), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for opioids or opiates detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified cutoff value as negative. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.</td></tr>

Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) Single Dose 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 15 mg 196 28 16.8 29 4.59 19 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 30 mg 377 24 34.6 21 4.61 19 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 60 mg 705 22 64.6 24 4.15 26 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics Avoid use with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because they may reduce analgesic effect of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.4) 7.1 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, or death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4). 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 2D6 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could me more pronounced with concomitant use of CYP2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 7.4 Mixed AgonistAntagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 7.5 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Opioids may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention andor severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The high drug content in extendedrelease formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. 9.2 Abuse All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Drug abuse is the intentional nontherapeutic use of an overthecounter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug abuse includes, but is not limited to, the following examples the use of a prescription or overthecounter drug to get high, or the use of steroids for performance enhancement and muscle build up. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to reduce abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is for oral use only. Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. With parenteral abuse, the inactive ingredients in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Abuse Deterrence Studies <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is formulated with inactive ingredients intended to make the tablet more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. For the purposes of describing the results of studies of the abusedeterrent characteristics of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> resulting from a change in formulation, in this section, the original formulation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, which is no longer marketed, will be referred to as original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and the reformulated, currently marketed product will be referred to as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>". In Vitro Testing In vitro physical and chemical tablet manipulation studies were performed to evaluate the success of different extraction methods in defeating the extendedrelease formulation. Results support that, relative to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, there is an increase in the ability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to resist crushing, breaking, and dissolution using a variety of tools and solvents. The results of these studies also support this finding for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> relative to an immediaterelease oxycodone. When subjected to an aqueous environment, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle. Clinical Studies In a randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled 5period crossover pharmacodynamic study, 30 recreational opioid users with a history of intranasal drug abuse received intranasally administered active and placebo drug treatments. The five treatment arms were finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, coarsely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, powdered oxycodone HCl 30 mg, and placebo. Data for finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, and powdered oxycodone HCl are described below. Drug liking was measured on a bipolar drug liking scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response of neither liking nor disliking, 0 represents maximum disliking and 100 represents maximum liking. Response to whether the subject would take the study drug again was also measured on a bipolar scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response, 0 represents the strongest negative response (definitely would not take drug again) and 100 represents the strongest positive response (definitely would take drug again). Twentyseven of the subjects completed the study. Incomplete dosing due to granules falling from the subjects nostrils occurred in 34 (n  10) of subjects with finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, compared with 7 (n  2) of subjects with finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and no subjects with powdered oxycodone HCl. The intranasal administration of finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was associated with a numerically lower mean and median drug liking score and a lower mean and median score for take drug again, compared to finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or powdered oxycodone HCl as summarized in Table 2. Table 2 Summary of Maximum Drug Liking (Emax) Data Following Intranasal Administration  Bipolar scales (0  maximum negative response, 50  neutral response, 100  maximum positive response) VAS Scale (100 mm) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (finely crushed) Original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (finely crushed) Oxycodone HCl (powdered) Drug Liking Mean (SE) 80.4 (3.9) 94.0 (2.7) 89.3 (3.1) Median (Range) 88 (36100) 100 (51100) 100 (50100) Take Drug Again Mean (SE) 64.0 (7.1) 89.6 (3.9) 86.6 (4.4) Median (Range) 78 (0100) 100 (20100) 100 (0100) Figure 1 demonstrates a comparison of drug liking for finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> compared to powdered oxycodone HCl in subjects who received both treatments.

Summary The in vitro data demonstrate that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has physicochemical properties expected to make abuse via injection difficult. The data from the clinical study, along with support from the in vitro data, also indicate that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce abuse via the intranasal route. However, abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by these routes, as well as by the oral route, is still possible. Additional data, including epidemiological data, when available, may provide further information on the impact of the current formulation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> on the abuse liability of the drug. Accordingly, this section may be updated in the future as appropriate. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1). Figure 1 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.4). If <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abruptly discontinued in a physicallydependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs see Use in Specific Populations (8.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. (2.1) For opioidnave and opioid nontolerant patients, initiate with 10 mg tablets orally every 12 hours. (2.1) Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a physically dependent patient. (2.4) Tablets must be swallowed intact and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.5, 5.1) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.5, 5.9, 17) 2.1 Initial Dosing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information (17). Crushing, chewing, or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with one 10 mg tablet orally every 12 hours. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg orally every 12 hours. Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Conversion from other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by administering onehalf of the patients total daily oral oxycodone dose as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours. Conversion from other Opioids to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> defined by clinical trials. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg orally every 12 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patients 24hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediaterelease opioid) than to overestimate the 24hour oral oxycodone requirements which could result in adverse reactions. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial interpatient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products. Conversion from Methadone to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long halflife and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.2 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiverfamily during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediaterelease analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioidrelated adverse reactions. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 2.4 Discontinuation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets, use a gradual downward titration of the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 2.5 Administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Instruct patients to swallow <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Instruct patients to take <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> one tablet at a time and with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Patient Counseling Information (17)."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone hydrochloride is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) Single Dose 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 15 mg 196 28 16.8 29 4.59 19 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 30 mg 377 24 34.6 21 4.61 19 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 60 mg 705 22 64.6 24 4.15 26 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers Oxycodone has been detected in human milk. Closely monitor infants of nursing women receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. (8.3) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Do not initiate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal signs can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, opioidnave females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be administered as directed in the products prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1).</td></tr>

(5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effects Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.7) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.9) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects. (5.14) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9). As modifiedrelease products such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9). Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patients risk for opioid addiction, abuse or misuse prior to prescribing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, and monitor all patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modifiedrelease opioid formulations such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death see Overdosage (10). Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug see Patient Counseling Information (17). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 LifeThreatening Respiratory Depression Serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modifiedrelease opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status see Overdosage (10). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioidinduced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are essential see Dosage and Administration (2). Overestimating the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension and profound sedation, coma, or respiratory depression may result if <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concomitantly with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patients response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patients use of alcohol or illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is made, start with 13 to 12 the usual dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.2). 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Lifethreatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Hypotensive Effects <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) see Drug Interactions (7.1). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In patients with circulatory shock, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In these patients, mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, gradually taper the dose see Dosage and Administration (2.4). Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid effects. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for opioids or opiates detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified cutoff value as negative. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 2.0 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly ( 65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Muscle relaxants Avoid use with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because of increased risk of respiratory depression. (7.2) The CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. (7.3) Mixed agonistantagonist opioid analgesics Avoid use with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because they may reduce analgesic effect of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.4) 7.1 CNS Depressants Concurrent use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression and hypotension. When such combined therapy is contemplated, start <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant. 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, significantly increased the plasma concentrations of oxycodone. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may prolong opioid effects. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inducers of CYP3A4 A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, significantly decreased plasma oxycodone concentrations. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance during oxycodone treatment. However, clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction. 7.4 Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should generally not be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 7.5 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Opioids may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention andor severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The high drug content in extendedrelease formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. 9.2 Abuse Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Drug abuse is the intentional nontherapeutic use of an overthecounter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug abuse includes, but is not limited to, the following examples the use of a prescription or overthecounter drug to get high, or the use of steroids for performance enhancement and muscle build up. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to reduce abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is for oral use only. Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol and other substances. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, or mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.4). If <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abruptly discontinued in a physicallydependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs see Use in Specific Populations (8.9).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosing based on patients prior analgesic treatment experience, and titrate as needed to provide adequate analgesia and minimize adverse reactions. (2.1, 2.2) Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a physically dependent patient. (2.4) Tablets must be swallowed intact and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.5, 5.1) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.5, 5.9, 17) 2.1 Initial Dosing Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior analgesic treatment experience. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Consider the following factors when selecting an initial dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Total daily dose, potency, and any prior opioid the patient has been taking previously Reliability of the relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent dose of oxycodone needed (Note potency estimates may vary with the route of administration) Patients degree of opioid experience and opioid tolerance General condition and medical status of the patient Concurrent medication Type and severity of the patients pain. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate therapy with 10 mg every 12 hours. Conversion from other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by administering onehalf of the patients total daily oral oxycodone dose as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours. Conversion from other Opioids to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> While there are useful tables of oral and parenteral equivalents, there is substantial interpatient variation in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and formulations. Specific recommendations are not available because of a lack of systematic evidence for these types of analgesic substitutions. As such, it is safer to underestimate a patients 24hour oral oxycodone requirement and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediaterelease oxycodone) than to overestimate and precipitate an adverse reaction. In general, begin with half of the estimated daily oxycodone requirement as the initial daily <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> estimate, then divide into two doses taken 12 hours apart, and manage inadequate analgesia by supplementation with immediaterelease oxycodone. Published relative potency data are available and may be referred to in clinical practice guidelines such as those published by authorities in the field of pain medicine, but such ratios are approximations. Consider contacting your specific state medical or pharmacy professional societies for further information on how to safely convert patients from one opioid to another. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.2 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancerrelated pain (or pain associated with other terminal illnesses), periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. If the level of pain increases, attempt to identify the source of increased pain, while adjusting the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose to decrease the level of pain. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dosage adjustments may be done every 1 to 2 days. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediaterelease opioid and nonopioid medication. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the next dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioidrelated adverse reactions. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 2.4 Discontinuation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets, use a gradual downward titration of the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physicallydependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 2.5 Administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Instruct patients to swallow <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2). Instruct patients to take <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> one tablet at a time and with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), and Patient Counseling Information (17)."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients.</td></tr>

The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock see Overdosage (10).

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure mu receptor opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, hydrocodone and oxymorphone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Increasing doses of pure mu receptor agonists are associated with increasing analgesia. There is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by adverse reactions, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly ( 65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers Oxycodone has been detected in human milk. Closely monitor infants of nursing women receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. (8.3) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 2.0 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Do not initiate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal signs can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, opioidnave females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials. 8.9 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Chronic maternal use of oxycodone during pregnancy can affect the fetus with subsequent withdrawal signs. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration and severity of neonatal withdrawal syndrome vary based on the drug used, duration of use, the dose of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of drug by the newborn. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be administered as directed in the products prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients, and patients with chronic pulmonary disease Monitor closely because of increased risk of respiratory depression. (5.4, 5.5) Interaction with CNS depressants Consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive effects. (5.6, 7.1) Hypotensive effects Monitor during dose initiation and titration (5.7) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.9) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where there is concern about increased risks of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain. Assess each patients risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. The risk for opioid abuse is increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modifiedrelease opioid formulations however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because these drugs carry a risk for addiction even under appropriate medical use. Misuse or abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk that could result in overdose and death see Overdosage (10). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 LifeThreatening Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Respiratory depression if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a sighing pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioidinduced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status see Overdosage (10). While serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and following dose increases. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed and to keep <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> out of the reach of children, as such inappropriate use may result in fatal respiratory depression. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are essential see Dosage and Administration (2). Overestimating the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Respiratory depression has also been reported with use of modifiedrelease opioids when used as recommended and not misused or abused. To further reduce the risk of respiratory depression, consider the following Proper dosing and titration are essential and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets are for use in opioidtolerant patients only. Ingestion of these strengths of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients not already tolerant to high doses of opioids. Instruct patients to swallow <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed. The resulting oxycodone dose may be fatal, particularly in opioidnave individuals. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with respiratory depression and in patients with conditions that increase the risk of lifethreatening respiratory depression see Contraindications (4). 5.3 Accidental Exposure Accidental ingestion of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Therefore, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). 5.5 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Interactions with Alcohol, CNS Depressants, and Illicit Drugs Hypotension, and profound sedation, coma or respiratory depression may result if <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concomitantly with other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, muscle relaxants, other opioids). When considering the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patients response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, consider the patients use, if any, of alcohol andor illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is to be initiated in a patient taking a CNS depressant, start with a lower <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose than usual and monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant see Drug Interactions (7.1). 5.7 Hypotensive Effects <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) see Drug Interactions (7.1). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In patients with circulatory shock, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In these patients, mixed agonistsantagonists analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, gradually taper the dose see Dosage and Administration (2.4). Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid effects. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.3), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for opioids or opiates detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified cutoff value as negative. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are designed to provide controlled delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Breaking, chewing or crushing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets eliminates the controlled delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is pH independent. Oxycodone is well absorbed from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets with an oral bioavailability of 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing in normal volunteers in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Dose proportionality andor bioavailability has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC). Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. The administration of oxycodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Interactions with other CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used with caution and started in a reduced dosage (13 to 12 of the usual dosage) in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for preemptive analgesia (administration preoperatively for the management of postoperative pain). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting has not been established. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the postoperative period if the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (See American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented. Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level. Tolerance and Physical Dependence Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy ). Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver Patients should be aware that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets will release all their contents at once if broken, chewed, or crushed, resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> without consulting the prescribing professional. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. Patients should be instructed to keep <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a secure place out of the reach of children. When <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addictive disorders. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence, either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Although clinical studies have not been conducted, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inducers of CYP3A4 Although clinical studies have not been conducted, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug, which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy, or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inducers. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance with this agent. Clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction, however. Use with CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies of oxycodone to evaluate its carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Oxycodone was not mutagenic in the following assays Ames Salmonella and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at doses of up to 5000 g, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes in the absence of metabolic activation at doses of up to 1500 gmL and with activation 48 hours after exposure at doses of up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in mice (at plasma levels of up to 48 gmL). Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation in the human chromosomal aberration test (at greater than or equal to 1250 gmL) at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure and in the mouse lymphoma assay at doses of 50 gmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 gmL or greater without metabolic activation. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively. These doses are 3 and 46 times a human dose of 160 mgday, based on mgkg basis. The results did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery. Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of oxycodone have been detected in breast milk. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because of the possibility of sedation andor respiratory depression in the infant. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18. It must be remembered that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets cannot be crushed or divided for administration. Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Laboratory Monitoring Due to the broad range of plasma concentrations seen in clinical populations, the varying degrees of pain, and the development of tolerance, plasma oxycodone measurements are usually not helpful in clinical management. Plasma concentrations of the active drug substance may be of value in selected, unusual or complex cases. Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment indicates greater plasma concentrations than those with normal function. The initiation of therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and careful dose titration is warranted. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. Dosages should be adjusted according to the clinical situation. Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation and in theory can be affected by drugs affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes. Oxycodone is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 to oxymorphone which represents less than 15 of the total administered dose. This route of elimination may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants). However, in a study involving 10 subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged., DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.

<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. In normal volunteers, the t of absorption is 0.4 hours for immediaterelease oral oxycodone. In contrast, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets exhibit a biphasic absorption pattern with two apparent absorption halflives of 0.6 and 6.9 hours, which describes the initial release of oxycodone from the tablet followed by a prolonged release., Plasma Oxycodone by Time Dose proportionality has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 1 below). Another study established that the 160 mg tablet is bioequivalent to 2 x 80 mg tablets as well as to 4 x 40 mg for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2 below).

Oxycodone has been found in breast milk (see PRECAUTIONS )., Metabolism Oxycodone hydrochloride is extensively metabolized to noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone, and their glucuronides. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation (to noroxycodone) is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation (to oxymorphone). Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions )., Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free oxycodone up to 19 conjugated oxycodone up to 50 free oxymorphone 0 conjugated oxymorphone  14 both free and conjugated noroxycodone have been found in the urine but not quantified. The total plasma clearance was 0.8 Lmin for adults., SAFETY AND HANDLING <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are solid dosage forms that contain oxycodone which is a controlled substance.

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Serious adverse reactions which may be associated with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablet therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, and (to an even lesser degree) circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock (see OVERDOSAGE ). The nonserious adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are typical opioid side effects. These events are dosedependent, and their frequency depends upon the dose, the clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent (5) include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and asthenia. In many cases the frequency of these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large swings in the plasma concentrations of the opioid. Many of these adverse events will cease or decrease in intensity as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed. Clinical trials comparing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with immediaterelease oxycodone and placebo revealed a similar adverse event profile between <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and immediaterelease oxycodone. The most common adverse events (5) reported by patients at least once during therapy were TABLE 3 <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (n227) ImmediateRelease (n225) Placebo (n45) () () () Constipation (23) (26) (7) Nausea (23) (27) (11) Somnolence (23) (24) (4) Dizziness (13) (16) (9) Pruritus (13) (12) (2) Vomiting (12) (14) (7) Headache (7) (8) (7) Dry Mouth (6) (7) (2) Asthenia (6) (7)  Sweating (5) (6) (2) The following adverse experiences were reported in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>treated patients with an incidence between 1 and 5.

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to oxycodone, or in any situation where opioids are contraindicated. This includes patients with significant respiratory depression (in unmonitored settings or the absence of resuscitative equipment), and patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in any patient who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Principles <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO MORPHINE. OXYCODONE, LIKE MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN ANALGESIA, CAN BE ABUSED AND IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be started on the lowest appropriate dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiation of Therapy ). In treating pain it is vital to assess the patient regularly and systematically. Therapy should also be regularly reviewed and adjusted based upon the patients own reports of pain and side effects and the health professionals clinical judgment. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The controlledrelease nature of the formulation allows <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to be effectively administered every 12 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). While symmetric (same dose AM and PM), aroundtheclock, q12h dosing is appropriate for the majority of patients, some patients may benefit from asymmetric (different dose given in AM than in PM) dosing, tailored to their pain pattern. It is usually appropriate to treat a patient with only one opioid for aroundtheclock therapy. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING ). Initiation of Therapy It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior opioid and nonopioid analgesic treatment. Attention should be given to (1)the general condition and medical status of the patient (2)the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking (3)the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone (4)the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) (5)the Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg and (6)the balance between pain control and adverse experiences. Care should be taken to use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS DrugDrug Interactions ). For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios from Foley, KM. NEJM, 1985 3138495, found below, are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg q12h. If a nonopioid analgesic is being provided, it may be continued. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 4 below), multiply the mgday of the previous opioids by the appropriate multiplication factors to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. When converting from oxycodone, divide the 24hour oxycodone dose in half to obtain the twice a day (q12h) dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down to a dose which is appropriate for the tablet strengths available. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. The recommended doses shown in Table 4 are only a starting point, and close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 4. Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Prior Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (MgDay Prior Opioid x Factor  MgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Prior Opioid Parenteral Prior Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 In all cases, supplemental analgesia should be made available in the form of a suitable shortacting analgesic. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be safely used concomitantly with usual doses of nonopioid analgesics and analgesic adjuvants, provided care is taken to select a proper initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg q12h of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 ghr fentanyl transdermal patch. The patient should be followed closely for early titration, as there is very limited clinical experience with this conversion. Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Experiences Most patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative andor stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids. Other opioidrelated side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually selflimited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered. Patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence. Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose at each increase. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiverfamily. Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg Tablets or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg (for use in opioidtolerant patients only) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, are for use in opioidtolerant patients only. A single daily dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets. Supplemental Analgesia Most patients given aroundtheclock therapy with controlledrelease opioids may need to have immediaterelease medication available for exacerbations of pain or to prevent pain that occurs predictably during certain patient activities (incident pain). Maintenance of Therapy The intent of the titration period is to establish a patientspecific q12h dose that will maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects for as long as pain relief is necessary. Should pain recur then the dose can be incrementally increased to reestablish pain control. The method of therapy adjustment outlined above should be employed to reestablish pain control. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, conservative dose conversion ratios should be followed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a full muagonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive use, use for nonmedical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, has been diverted for nonmedical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> consists of a dualpolymer matrix, intended for oral use only. Abuse of the crushed tablet poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients, especially talc, can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard from oxycodone, the active ingredient in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as with all opioid agonists. Respiratory depression is a particular problem in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative nonopioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphinetype, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</td></tr>

A single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been reported as being abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death (see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ). Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Oxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure agonist opioid whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonistantagonists or nonopioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdose (See OVERDOSAGE ). Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for analgesia will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Experience Relationships <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are associated with typical opioidrelated adverse experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse experiences such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant. As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL TRIALS A doubleblind placebocontrolled, fixeddose, parallel group, twoweek study was conducted in 133 patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain, who were judged as having inadequate pain control with their current therapy. In this study, 20 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h but not 10 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h decreased pain compared with placebo, and this difference was statistically significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects., Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of oxycodone overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) . NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis).

The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration Over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination halflife of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use In Specific Populations (8.3) . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions) . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration in to the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly (65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use In Specific Populations (8.8) . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation followed by CYP2B6, CYP2C919 and CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxymorphone is a minor metabolite, its formation is catalyzed primarily by CYP2D6 and to a small extent by CYP2C19. The formation of oxymorphone may be blocked by a variety of drugs (such as antipsychotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, etc.) that inhibit these enzymes. However, in a study involving ten subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of CYP2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone see Drug Interactions (7.2) .</td></tr>

(7.1) The CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. (7.2) Concurrent use of other CNS depressants may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. (7.3) Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. (7.4) 7.1 Neuromuscular Junction Blocking Agents <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants (such as pancuronium) and produce an increased degree andor duration of respiratory depression. 7.2 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. A published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Although clinical studies have not been conducted with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance during oxycodone treatment. 7.3 CNS Depressants Start <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other CNS depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ) . 7.4 Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should generally not be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. Neonates whose mothers have been taking opioids chronically may also exhibit withdrawal signs, either at birth andor in the nursery, because they have developed physical dependence. This is not, however, synonymous with addiction see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) . Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. 9.2 Abuse Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Opioid drugs are sought by people with substance use disorders (abuse or addiction, the latter of which is also called "substance dependence") and criminals who supply them by diverting medicines out of legitimate distribution channels. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a target for theft and diversion. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drugseeking tactics include, but are not limited to, emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, altering or forging of prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among people with untreated substance use disorders, and criminals who divert controlled substances. The risks of misuse and abuse should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Concerns about abuse and addiction, should not prevent the proper management of pain, however. Treatment of pain should be individualized, balancing the potential benefits and risks for each patient. Compromising an extended or controlledrelease delivery system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The risk of fatal overdose is further increased when oxycodone is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive abuse, repeated use for nonmedical purposes, loss of control over intake, craving of psychic effects and continued abuse despite harm or risk of harm in medical, social, legal or occupational domains. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, but relapse is common. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by intentional misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been diverted for nonmedical use. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, proper dispensing and correct storage and handling are appropriate measures that help to limit misuse and abuse of opioid drugs. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence to an opioid is manifested by characteristic withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug, significant dose reduction or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome in adults is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, piloerection, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate see Use In Specific Populations (8.2) .

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use low initial doses in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other central nervous system (CNS) active medications. (2.2) For patients already receiving opioids, use standard conversion ratio estimates. (2.2) Tablets must be swallowed whole and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.1) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.1, 17.1) 2.1 Safe Administration Instructions <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time. Take each tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) . Selection of patients for treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, Federation of State Medical Boards Model Policy, and the American Pain Society. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring. 2.2 Initiating Therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually. Attention should be given to risk factors for abuse or addiction including whether the patient has a previous or current substance abuse problem, a family history of substance abuse, or a history of mental illness or depression the age, general condition and medical status of the patient the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone the special instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg see Dosage and Administration (2.7)  and the balance between pain control and adverse reactions. Use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3). Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg every 12 hours. Individually titrate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions while maintaining an everytwelvehour dosing regimen. For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios found in Table 1 are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. A reasonable approach for converting from existing opioid therapy to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is as follows Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. Using standard conversion ratio estimates ( see Table 1 ), multiply the mgday of each of the current opioids to be converted by their appropriate multiplication factor to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. Divide the calculated 24hour oxycodone dose in half to approximate the every 12hour dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablet strengths available. Close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 1 Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Current Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone1  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (mgDay Opioid x Factor  mgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Opioid Parenteral Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 2.3 Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.4 Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 2.5 Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Reactions Most patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience adverse reactions. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids, therefore, anticipate constipation and treat aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative with or without a stool softener. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, consider treatment with antiemetics or other modalities to relieve these symptoms. 2.6 Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, assess pain relief and other opioid effects frequently. Titrate patients to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. Increase the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose by increasing the total daily dose, not by changing the 12hour dosing interval. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse reactions. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, maintain frequent contact between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and, with proper consent, the caregiverfamily. 2.7 Special Instructions for Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant Do not begin treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg in patients who are not already tolerant to the respiratorydepressant and sedating effects of opioids. Use of these doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. These doses are only for use in opioidtolerant patients. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Instruct patients not to share or permit use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. 2.8 Continuation of Therapy During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, reassess the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy regularly (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. 2.9 Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, taper the dose gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physicallydependent patient. 2.10 Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, follow conservative dose conversion ratios. When converting from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to parenteral opioids, it is advisable to calculate an equivalent parenteral dose and then initiate treatment at half of this calculated value."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure mu receptor opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, hydrocodone and oxymorphone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Increasing doses of pure mu receptor agonists are associated with increasing analgesia. There is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by adverse reactions, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10) . Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Endocrine System Opioids may influence the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal or gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. Immune System In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions, depending on the context in which they are used. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration Over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination halflife of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3 Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr)  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone which can enhance absorption Single Dose 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 15 mg 196 28 16.8 29 4.59 19 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 30 mg 377 24 34.6 21 4.61 19 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 60 mg 705 22 64.6 24 4.15 26 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use In Specific Populations (8.3) . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions) . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration in to the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly (65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use In Specific Populations (8.8) . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation followed by CYP2B6, CYP2C919 and CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxymorphone is a minor metabolite, its formation is catalyzed primarily by CYP2D6 and to a small extent by CYP2C19. The formation of oxymorphone may be blocked by a variety of drugs (such as antipsychotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, etc.) that inhibit these enzymes. However, in a study involving ten subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of CYP2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone see Drug Interactions (7.2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>abuse</i>:</td><td>9.2 Abuse Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Opioid drugs are sought by people with substance use disorders (abuse or addiction, the latter of which is also called "substance dependence") and criminals who supply them by diverting medicines out of legitimate distribution channels. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a target for theft and diversion. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drugseeking tactics include, but are not limited to, emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, altering or forging of prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among people with untreated substance use disorders, and criminals who divert controlled substances. The risks of misuse and abuse should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Concerns about abuse and addiction, should not prevent the proper management of pain, however. Treatment of pain should be individualized, balancing the potential benefits and risks for each patient. Compromising an extended or controlledrelease delivery system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The risk of fatal overdose is further increased when oxycodone is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive abuse, repeated use for nonmedical purposes, loss of control over intake, craving of psychic effects and continued abuse despite harm or risk of harm in medical, social, legal or occupational domains. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, but relapse is common. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by intentional misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been diverted for nonmedical use. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, proper dispensing and correct storage and handling are appropriate measures that help to limit misuse and abuse of opioid drugs. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Labor and Delivery Not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor and delivery (8.2) Nursing Mothers Nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. (8.3) Pediatrics Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established. (8.4) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) Renal impairment Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) . NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. Neonates whose mothers have been taking opioids chronically may also exhibit withdrawal signs, either at birth andor in the nursery, because they have developed physical dependence. This is not, however, synonymous with addiction see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) . Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Do not initiate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>

Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested (8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. It is important to take the pharmacokinetic profile of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> into account when treating overdose. Even in the face of improvement, continued medical monitoring is required because of the possibility of extended effects as opioid continues to be absorbed from ingested tablets. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of whole <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets, and with abuse and misuse by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdosage, primary attention should be given to the maintenance of a patent airway, and of effective ventilation (clearance of CO2) and oxygenation, whether by spontaneous, assisted or controlled respiration. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Since the duration of action of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may exceed that of the antagonist, especially when the overdose involves intact tablets, keep the patient under continued surveillance and administer repeated doses of the antagonist according to the antagonist labeling as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Do not administer opioid antagonists in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt partial or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence (or withdrawal) syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. See the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of its proper use.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10) . Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Endocrine System Opioids may influence the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal or gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. Immune System In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions, depending on the context in which they are used. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dependence</i>:</td><td>9.3 Dependence Physical dependence to an opioid is manifested by characteristic withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug, significant dose reduction or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome in adults is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, piloerection, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate see Use In Specific Populations (8.2) . In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.9) .</td></tr>

(5.13) May impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. (5.14) No approved use in the treatment of addiction. (5.15) Not every urine drug test for "opioids" or "opiates" detects oxycodone reliably. (5.16) 5.1 Information Essential for Safe Administration <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in opioidtolerant patients . Use of these doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. 5.2 CNS Depression <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause somnolence, dizziness, alterations in judgment and alterations in levels of consciousness, including coma. 5.3 Interactions with Alcohol, CNS Depressants and Illicit Drugs Hypotension, profound sedation, coma or respiratory depression may result if <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is added to a regimen that includes other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). Therefore, use caution when deciding to initiate therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are taking other CNS depressants. Take into account the types of other medications being taken, the duration of therapy with them, and the patients response to those medicines, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Consider the patients use, if any, of alcohol andor illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is made, start with a lower <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose than usual see Drug Interactions (7.3) . Consider using a lower initial dose of a CNS depressant when given to a patient currently taking <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> due to the potential of additive CNS depressant effects. 5.4 Respiratory Depression Decreased respiratory drive resulting in respiratory depression is the chief hazard from the use or abuse of opioid agonists, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. The risk of opioidinduced respiratory depression is increased, for example, in elderly see Use In Specific Populations (8.5) or debilitated patients following large initial doses in any patient who is not tolerant to the respiratorydepressant or sedating effects of opioids or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that either depress respiratory drive or consciousness. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with extreme caution in patients with any of the following significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale other risk of substantially decreased respiratory reserve hypoxia hypercapnia preexisting respiratory depression Respiratory depression induced by opioids typically follows a pattern entailing first a shift in CO2 responsiveness of the CNS respiratory drive center, which results in a decrease in the urge to breathe, despite the presence of hypercapnia. The increase in brain CO2 can result in sedation that can accentuate the sedation from the opioid itself. Profound sedation, unresponsiveness, infrequent deep ("sighing") breaths or atypical snoring frequently accompany opioidinduced respiratory depression. Eventually, hypoxia ensues. In addition to further decreasing consciousness, hypoxia, along with hypercapnia, can predispose to lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5 Seizures Oxycodone, as with other opioids, may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorders. 5.6 Difficulty Swallowing and Gastrointestinal Effects There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Use caution when prescribing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. The administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in patients who are at risk of developing ileus. 5.7 Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention, which can lead to an elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. This effect may be exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone may produce miosis that is independent of ambient light, and altered consciousness, either of which may obscure neurologic signs associated with increased intracranial pressure in persons with head injuries. 5.8 Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Administer <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.9 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. The expected clinical results with CYP3A4 inhibitors would be an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and possibly increased or prolonged opioid effects. The expected clinical results with CYP3A4 inducers would be a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 5.10 Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics It is generally not advisable to administer mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) to a patient receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 5.11 Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.12 Tolerance Tolerance to opioids is demonstrated by the need for increasing doses to maintain adequate analgesic effect (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). If tolerance develops, or if pain severity increases, a gradual increase in dose may be required. The first sign of tolerance is usually a reduced duration of effect. Tolerance to different effects of opioids may develop to varying degrees and at varying rates in a given individual. There is also interpatient variability in the rate and extent of tolerance that develops to various opioid effects, whether the effect is desirable (e.g., analgesia) or undesirable (e.g., nausea). 5.13 Special Risk Groups Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in the following conditions, due to increased risk of adverse reactions alcoholism delirium tremens adrenocortical insufficiency CNS depression debilitation kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory compromise myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. 5.14 Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients accordingly. 5.15 Use in Addiction Treatment <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has no approved use in the treatment of addiction. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol addiction (substance dependence), either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. 5.16 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for "opioids" or "opiates" detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified "cutoff" value as "negative". Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and use caution in interpreting results.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are designed to provide controlled delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Breaking, chewing or crushing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets eliminates the controlled delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is pH independent. Oxycodone is well absorbed from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets with an oral bioavailability of 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing in normal volunteers in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Dose proportionality andor bioavailability has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC). Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. The administration of oxycodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Interactions with other CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used with caution and started in a reduced dosage (13 to 12 of the usual dosage) in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for preemptive analgesia (administration preoperatively for the management of postoperative pain). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting has not been established. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the postoperative period if the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (See American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented. Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level. Tolerance and Physical Dependence Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy ). Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver Patients should be aware that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets will release all their contents at once if broken, chewed, or crushed, resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> without consulting the prescribing professional. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. Patients should be instructed to keep <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a secure place out of the reach of children. When <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addictive disorders. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence, either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Although clinical studies have not been conducted, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inducers of CYP3A4 Although clinical studies have not been conducted, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug, which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy, or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inducers. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance with this agent. Clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction, however. Use with CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies of oxycodone to evaluate its carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Oxycodone was not mutagenic in the following assays Ames Salmonella and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at doses of up to 5000 g, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes in the absence of metabolic activation at doses of up to 1500 gmL and with activation 48 hours after exposure at doses of up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in mice (at plasma levels of up to 48 gmL). Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation in the human chromosomal aberration test (at greater than or equal to 1250 gmL) at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure and in the mouse lymphoma assay at doses of 50 gmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 gmL or greater without metabolic activation. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively. These doses are 3 and 46 times a human dose of 160 mgday, based on mgkg basis. The results did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery. Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of oxycodone have been detected in breast milk. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because of the possibility of sedation andor respiratory depression in the infant. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18. It must be remembered that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets cannot be crushed or divided for administration. Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Laboratory Monitoring Due to the broad range of plasma concentrations seen in clinical populations, the varying degrees of pain, and the development of tolerance, plasma oxycodone measurements are usually not helpful in clinical management. Plasma concentrations of the active drug substance may be of value in selected, unusual or complex cases. Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment indicates greater plasma concentrations than those with normal function. The initiation of therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and careful dose titration is warranted. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. Dosages should be adjusted according to the clinical situation. Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation and in theory can be affected by drugs affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes. Oxycodone is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 to oxymorphone which represents less than 15 of the total administered dose. This route of elimination may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants). However, in a study involving 10 subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged., DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is NOT intended for use as a prn analgesic. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case, initiating therapy at the appropriate point along a progression from nonopioid analgesics, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acetaminophen to opioids in a plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly known as the Agency for HealthCare Policy and Research), the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines, or the American Pain Society. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 1224 hours following surgery), or if the pain is mild, or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time.

<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. In normal volunteers, the t of absorption is 0.4 hours for immediaterelease oral oxycodone. In contrast, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets exhibit a biphasic absorption pattern with two apparent absorption halflives of 0.6 and 6.9 hours, which describes the initial release of oxycodone from the tablet followed by a prolonged release., Plasma Oxycodone by Time Dose proportionality has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 1 below). Another study established that the 160 mg tablet is bioequivalent to 2 x 80 mg tablets as well as to 4 x 40 mg for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2 below). Given the short halflife of elimination of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Data from a study involving 21 normal volunteers show that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets administered per rectum resulted in an AUC 39 greater and a Cmax 9 higher than tablets administered by mouth. Therefore, there is an increased risk of adverse events with rectal administration. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Figure, Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. However, the peak plasma concentration of oxycodone increased by 25 when a <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg Tablet was administered with a highfat meal., Distribution Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk (see PRECAUTIONS )., Metabolism Oxycodone hydrochloride is extensively metabolized to noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone, and their glucuronides. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation (to noroxycodone) is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation (to oxymorphone). Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions )., Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free oxycodone up to 19 conjugated oxycodone up to 50 free oxymorphone 0 conjugated oxymorphone  14 both free and conjugated noroxycodone have been found in the urine but not quantified. The total plasma clearance was 0.8 Lmin for adults., SAFETY AND HANDLING <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are solid dosage forms that contain oxycodone which is a controlled substance. Like morphine, oxycodone is controlled under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been targeted for theft and diversion by criminals.

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Serious adverse reactions which may be associated with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablet therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, and (to an even lesser degree) circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock (see OVERDOSAGE ). The nonserious adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are typical opioid side effects. These events are dosedependent, and their frequency depends upon the dose, the clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent (5) include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and asthenia. In many cases the frequency of these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large swings in the plasma concentrations of the opioid. Many of these adverse events will cease or decrease in intensity as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed. Clinical trials comparing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with immediaterelease oxycodone and placebo revealed a similar adverse event profile between <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and immediaterelease oxycodone.

This includes patients with significant respiratory depression (in unmonitored settings or the absence of resuscitative equipment), and patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in any patient who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Principles <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO MORPHINE. OXYCODONE, LIKE MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN ANALGESIA, CAN BE ABUSED AND IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be started on the lowest appropriate dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiation of Therapy ). In treating pain it is vital to assess the patient regularly and systematically. Therapy should also be regularly reviewed and adjusted based upon the patients own reports of pain and side effects and the health professionals clinical judgment. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The controlledrelease nature of the formulation allows <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to be effectively administered every 12 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). While symmetric (same dose AM and PM), aroundtheclock, q12h dosing is appropriate for the majority of patients, some patients may benefit from asymmetric (different dose given in AM than in PM) dosing, tailored to their pain pattern. It is usually appropriate to treat a patient with only one opioid for aroundtheclock therapy. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING ). Initiation of Therapy It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior opioid and nonopioid analgesic treatment. Attention should be given to (1)the general condition and medical status of the patient (2)the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking (3)the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone (4)the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) (5)the Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg and (6)the balance between pain control and adverse experiences. Care should be taken to use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS DrugDrug Interactions ). For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios from Foley, KM. NEJM, 1985 3138495, found below, are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg q12h. If a nonopioid analgesic is being provided, it may be continued. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 4 below), multiply the mgday of the previous opioids by the appropriate multiplication factors to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. When converting from oxycodone, divide the 24hour oxycodone dose in half to obtain the twice a day (q12h) dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down to a dose which is appropriate for the tablet strengths available. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. The recommended doses shown in Table 4 are only a starting point, and close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 4. Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Prior Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (MgDay Prior Opioid x Factor  MgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Prior Opioid Parenteral Prior Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 In all cases, supplemental analgesia should be made available in the form of a suitable shortacting analgesic. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be safely used concomitantly with usual doses of nonopioid analgesics and analgesic adjuvants, provided care is taken to select a proper initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg q12h of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 ghr fentanyl transdermal patch. The patient should be followed closely for early titration, as there is very limited clinical experience with this conversion. Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Experiences Most patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative andor stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids. Other opioidrelated side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually selflimited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered. Patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence. Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose at each increase. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiverfamily. Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg Tablets or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg (for use in opioidtolerant patients only) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, are for use in opioidtolerant patients only. A single daily dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets. Supplemental Analgesia Most patients given aroundtheclock therapy with controlledrelease opioids may need to have immediaterelease medication available for exacerbations of pain or to prevent pain that occurs predictably during certain patient activities (incident pain). Maintenance of Therapy The intent of the titration period is to establish a patientspecific q12h dose that will maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects for as long as pain relief is necessary. Should pain recur then the dose can be incrementally increased to reestablish pain control. The method of therapy adjustment outlined above should be employed to reestablish pain control. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, conservative dose conversion ratios should be followed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a full muagonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive use, use for nonmedical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, has been diverted for nonmedical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> consists of a dualpolymer matrix, intended for oral use only. Abuse of the crushed tablet poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients, especially talc, can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard from oxycodone, the active ingredient in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as with all opioid agonists. Respiratory depression is a particular problem in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative nonopioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphinetype, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</td></tr>

Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been reported as being abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death (see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ). Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Oxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure agonist opioid whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonistantagonists or nonopioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdose (See OVERDOSAGE ). Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for analgesia will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Experience Relationships <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are associated with typical opioidrelated adverse experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse experiences such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant. As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL TRIALS A doubleblind placebocontrolled, fixeddose, parallel group, twoweek study was conducted in 133 patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain, who were judged as having inadequate pain control with their current therapy. In this study, 20 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h but not 10 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h decreased pain compared with placebo, and this difference was statistically significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects., Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of oxycodone overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) Single Dose 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics Avoid use with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS because they may reduce analgesic effect of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.4) 7.1 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, or death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4). 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 2D6 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could me more pronounced with concomitant use of CYP2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 7.4 Mixed AgonistAntagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. 7.5 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Opioids may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention andor severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS contain oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The high drug content in extendedrelease formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. 9.2 Abuse All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Drug abuse is the intentional nontherapeutic use of an overthecounter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug abuse includes, but is not limited to, the following examples the use of a prescription or overthecounter drug to get high, or the use of steroids for performance enhancement and muscle build up. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to reduce abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are for oral use only. Abuse of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS pose a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. With parenteral abuse, the inactive ingredients in OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Abuse Deterrence Studies OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are formulated with inactive ingredients intended to make the tablet more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. For the purposes of describing the results of studies of the abusedeterrent characteristics of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS resulting from a change in formulation, in this section, the original formulation of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, which is no longer marketed, will be referred to as original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and the reformulated, currently marketed product will be referred to as OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS ". In Vitro Testing In vitro physical and chemical tablet manipulation studies were performed to evaluate the success of different extraction methods in defeating the extendedrelease formulation. Results support that, relative to original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, there is an increase in the ability of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to resist crushing, breaking, and dissolution using a variety of tools and solvents. The results of these studies also support this finding for OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to an immediaterelease oxycodone. When subjected to an aqueous environment, OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle. Clinical Studies In a randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled 5period crossover pharmacodynamic study, 30 recreational opioid users with a history of intranasal drug abuse received intranasally administered active and placebo drug treatments. The five treatment arms were finely crushed OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 30 mg tablets, coarsely crushed OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 30 mg tablets, finely crushed original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 30 mg tablets, powdered oxycodone HCl 30 mg, and placebo. Data for finely crushed OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, finely crushed original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, and powdered oxycodone HCl are described below. Drug liking was measured on a bipolar drug liking scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response of neither liking nor disliking, 0 represents maximum disliking and 100 represents maximum liking. Response to whether the subject would take the study drug again was also measured on a bipolar scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response, 0 represents the strongest negative response (definitely would not take drug again) and 100 represents the strongest positive response (definitely would take drug again). Twentyseven of the subjects completed the study. Incomplete dosing due to granules falling from the subjects nostrils occurred in 34 (n  10) of subjects with finely crushed OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, compared with 7 (n  2) of subjects with finely crushed original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and no subjects with powdered oxycodone HCl. The intranasal administration of finely crushed OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was associated with a numerically lower mean and median drug liking score and a lower mean and median score for take drug again, compared to finely crushed original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS or powdered oxycodone HCl as summarized in Table 2.

Approximately 44 (n  12) had no reduction in liking with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to oxycodone HCl. Approximately 56 (n  15) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to oxycodone HCl. Thirtythree percent (n  9) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30 in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to oxycodone HCl, and approximately 22 (n  6) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50 in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to oxycodone HCl. Figure 1 Percent Reduction Profiles for Emax of Drug Liking VAS for OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS vs. oxycodone HCl, N27 Following Intranasal Administration The results of a similar analysis of drug liking for finely crushed OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to finely crushed original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS were comparable to the results of finely crushed OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to powdered oxycodone HCl. Approximately 43 (n  12) of subjects had no reduction in liking with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS relative to original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS . Approximately 57 (n  16) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking, 36 (n  10) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30 in drug liking, and approximately 29 (n  8) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50 in drug liking with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS compared to original OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS . Summary The in vitro data demonstrate that OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS have physicochemical properties expected to make abuse via injection difficult. The data from the clinical study, along with support from the in vitro data, also indicate that OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS have physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce abuse via the intranasal route. However, abuse of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS by these routes, as well as by the oral route, is still possible. Additional data, including epidemiological data, when available, may provide further information on the impact of the current formulation of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS on the abuse liability of the drug. Accordingly, this section may be updated in the future as appropriate. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS contains oxycodone, an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1). Figure 1 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.4). If OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is abruptly discontinued in a physicallydependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs see Use in Specific Populations (8.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. (2.1) For opioidnave and opioid nontolerant patients, initiate with 10 mg tablets orally every 12 hours. (2.1) Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in a physically dependent patient. (2.4) Tablets must be swallowed intact and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.5, 5.1) OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.5, 5.9, 17) 2.1 Initial Dosing OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) . Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ). OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . Crushing, chewing, or dissolving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) . Use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate treatment with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS with one 10 mg tablet orally every 12 hours. Use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg orally every 12 hours. Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Conversion from other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS by administering onehalf of the patients total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours. Conversion from other Opioids to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS defined by clinical trials. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg orally every 12 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patients 24hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediaterelease opioid) than to overestimate the 24hour oral oxycodone requirements which could result in adverse reactions. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial interpatient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products. Conversion from Methadone to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long halflife and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.2 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiverfamily during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediaterelease analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS dose. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioidrelated adverse reactions. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 2.4 Discontinuation of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS When the patient no longer requires therapy with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, use a gradual downward titration of the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. 2.5 Administration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS Instruct patients to swallow OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Instruct patients to take OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS one tablet at a time and with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Patient Counseling Information (17)."</td></tr>

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical Inc. at 18008289393 or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock see Overdosage (10).

Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention. In addition to the events listed above, the following have also been reported, potentially due to the swelling and hydrogelling property of the tablet choking, gagging, regurgitation, tablets stuck in the throat and difficulty swallowing the tablet.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone hydrochloride is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) Single Dose 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers Oxycodone has been detected in human milk. Closely monitor infants of nursing women receiving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. (8.3) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Do not initiate OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal signs can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, opioidnave females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be administered as directed in the products prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression and death. If coadminstration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs. (5.4) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease Monitor closely because of increased risk for lifethreatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effects Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.7) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.9) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects. (5.14) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS contain oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ). As modifiedrelease products such as OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patients risk for opioid addiction, abuse or misuse prior to prescribing OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, and monitor all patients receiving OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modifiedrelease opioid formulations such as OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death see Overdosage ( 10 ). Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 LifeThreatening Respiratory Depression Serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modifiedrelease opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status see Overdosage ( 10 ) . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioidinduced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are essential see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) . Overestimating the OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension and profound sedation, coma, or respiratory depression may result if OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is used concomitantly with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patients response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patients use of alcohol or illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy is made, start with 13 to 12 the usual dose of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) . 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Lifethreatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and when OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) . 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS , as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Hypotensive Effects OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) see Drug Interactions (7.1). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In patients with circulatory shock, OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS are contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. In these patients, mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, gradually taper the dose see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) . Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid effects. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating OXYCODONE HCL EXTENDEDRELEASE TABLETS treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for opioids or opiates detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified cutoff value as negative. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested (8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups. see Nonclinical Toxicology (13) NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration Over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination halflife of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use In Specific Populations (8.3) . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions) . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration in to the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly (65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use In Specific Populations (8.8) . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation followed by CYP2B6, CYP2C919 and CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxymorphone is a minor metabolite, its formation is catalyzed primarily by CYP2D6 and to a small extent by CYP2C19. The formation of oxymorphone may be blocked by a variety of drugs (such as antipsychotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, etc.) that inhibit these enzymes. However, in a study involving ten subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of CYP2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone. see Drug Interactions (7.2)</td></tr>

(7.1) The CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. (7.2) Concurrent use of other CNS depressants may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. (7.3) Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. (7.4) 7.1 Neuromuscular Junction Blocking Agents <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants (such as pancuronium) and produce an increased degree andor duration of respiratory depression. 7.2 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. A published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Although clinical studies have not been conducted with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance during oxycodone treatment. 7.3 CNS Depressants Start <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other CNS depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ) 7.4 Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should generally not be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. Neonates whose mothers have been taking opioids chronically may also exhibit withdrawal signs, either at birth andor in the nursery, because they have developed physical dependence. This is not, however, synonymous with addiction see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) . Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. 9.2 Abuse Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Opioid drugs are sought by people with substance use disorders (abuse or addiction, the latter of which is also called "substance dependence") and criminals who supply them by diverting medicines out of legitimate distribution channels. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a target for theft and diversion. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drugseeking tactics include, but are not limited to, emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, altering or forging of prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among people with untreated substance use disorders, and criminals who divert controlled substances. The risks of misuse and abuse should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Concerns about abuse and addiction, should not prevent the proper management of pain, however. Treatment of pain should be individualized, balancing the potential benefits and risks for each patient. Compromising an extended or controlledrelease delivery system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The risk of fatal overdose is further increased when oxycodone is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive abuse, repeated use for nonmedical purposes, loss of control over intake, craving of psychic effects and continued abuse despite harm or risk of harm in medical, social, legal or occupational domains. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, but relapse is common. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by intentional misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been diverted for nonmedical use. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, proper dispensing and correct storage and handling are appropriate measures that help to limit misuse and abuse of opioid drugs. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence to an opioid is manifested by characteristic withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug, significant dose reduction or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome in adults is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, piloerection, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use low initial doses in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other central nervous system (CNS) active medications. (2.2) For patients already receiving opioids, use standard conversion ratio estimates. (2.2) Tablets must be swallowed whole and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.1) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.1, 17.1) 2.1 Safe Administration Instructions <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time. Take each tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) . Selection of patients for treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, Federation of State Medical Boards Model Policy, and the American Pain Society. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring. 2.2 Initiating Therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually. Attention should be given to risk factors for abuse or addiction including whether the patient has a previous or current substance abuse problem, a family history of substance abuse, or a history of mental illness or depression the age, general condition and medical status of the patient the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone the special instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg see Dosage and Administration (2.7)  and the balance between pain control and adverse reactions. Use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3). Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg every 12 hours. Individually titrate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions while maintaining an everytwelvehour dosing regimen. For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios found in Table 1 are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. A reasonable approach for converting from existing opioid therapy to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is as follows Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 1), multiply the mgday of each of the current opioids to be converted by their appropriate multiplication factor to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. Divide the calculated 24hour oxycodone dose in half to approximate the every 12hour dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablet strengths available. Close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 1 Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Current Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone1  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (mgDay Opioid x Factor  mgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Opioid Parenteral Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 2.3 Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.4 Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 2.5 Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Reactions Most patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience adverse reactions. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids, therefore, anticipate constipation and treat aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative with or without a stool softener. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, consider treatment with antiemetics or other modalities to relieve these symptoms. 2.6 Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, assess pain relief and other opioid effects frequently. Titrate patients to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. Increase the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose by increasing the total daily dose, not by changing the 12hour dosing interval. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse reactions. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, maintain frequent contact between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and, with proper consent, the caregiverfamily. 2.7 Special Instructions for Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant Do not begin treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg in patients who are not already tolerant to the respiratorydepressant and sedating effects of opioids. Use of these doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. These doses are only for use in opioidtolerant patients. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Instruct patients not to share or permit use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. 2.8 Continuation of Therapy During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, reassess the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy regularly (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. 2.9 Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, taper the dose gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physicallydependent patient. 2.10 Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, follow conservative dose conversion ratios. When converting from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to parenteral opioids, it is advisable to calculate an equivalent parenteral dose and then initiate treatment at half of this calculated value."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure mu receptor opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, hydrocodone and oxymorphone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Increasing doses of pure mu receptor agonists are associated with increasing analgesia. There is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by adverse reactions, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose See Overdosage (10) . Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Endocrine System Opioids may influence the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal or gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. Immune System In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions, depending on the context in which they are used. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration Over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination halflife of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use In Specific Populations (8.3) . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions) . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration in to the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly (65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use In Specific Populations (8.8) . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation followed by CYP2B6, CYP2C919 and CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxymorphone is a minor metabolite, its formation is catalyzed primarily by CYP2D6 and to a small extent by CYP2C19. The formation of oxymorphone may be blocked by a variety of drugs (such as antipsychotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, etc.) that inhibit these enzymes. However, in a study involving ten subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of CYP2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone. see Drug Interactions (7.2)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>abuse</i>:</td><td>9.2 Abuse Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Opioid drugs are sought by people with substance use disorders (abuse or addiction, the latter of which is also called "substance dependence") and criminals who supply them by diverting medicines out of legitimate distribution channels. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a target for theft and diversion. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drugseeking tactics include, but are not limited to, emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, altering or forging of prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among people with untreated substance use disorders, and criminals who divert controlled substances. The risks of misuse and abuse should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Concerns about abuse and addiction, should not prevent the proper management of pain, however. Treatment of pain should be individualized, balancing the potential benefits and risks for each patient. Compromising an extended or controlledrelease delivery system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The risk of fatal overdose is further increased when oxycodone is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive abuse, repeated use for nonmedical purposes, loss of control over intake, craving of psychic effects and continued abuse despite harm or risk of harm in medical, social, legal or occupational domains. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, but relapse is common. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by intentional misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been diverted for nonmedical use. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, proper dispensing and correct storage and handling are appropriate measures that help to limit misuse and abuse of opioid drugs. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Labor and Delivery Not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor and delivery (8.2) Nursing Mothers Nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. (8.3) Pediatrics Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established. (8.4) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to  of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) Renal impairment Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups. see Nonclinical Toxicology (13) NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. Neonates whose mothers have been taking opioids chronically may also exhibit withdrawal signs, either at birth andor in the nursery, because they have developed physical dependence. This is not, however, synonymous with addiction see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) . Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Do not initiate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to  the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested (8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

It is important to take the pharmacokinetic profile of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> into account when treating overdose. Even in the face of improvement, continued medical monitoring is required because of the possibility of extended effects as opioid continues to be absorbed from ingested tablets. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of whole <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets, and with abuse and misuse by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdosage, primary attention should be given to the maintenance of a patent airway, and of effective ventilation (clearance of CO2) and oxygenation, whether by spontaneous, assisted or controlled respiration. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Since the duration of action of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may exceed that of the antagonist, especially when the overdose involves intact tablets, keep the patient under continued surveillance and administer repeated doses of the antagonist according to the antagonist labeling as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Do not administer opioid antagonists in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt partial or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence (or withdrawal) syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. See the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of its proper use.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose See Overdosage (10) . Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Endocrine System Opioids may influence the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal or gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. Immune System In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions, depending on the context in which they are used. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dependence</i>:</td><td>9.3 Dependence Physical dependence to an opioid is manifested by characteristic withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug, significant dose reduction or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome in adults is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, piloerection, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. See Use In Specific Populations (8.2) In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.9) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Must be swallowed whole (5.1) May cause somnolence, dizziness, alterations in judgment and alterations in levels of consciousness, including coma. (5.2) Additive CNS effects are expected when used with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.1, 5.3, 7.3) Use with caution in patients who are receiving other CNS depressants. (5.1, 5.3, 7.3) May cause respiratory depression, use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression, elderly and debilitated patients (5.4) May aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. (5.5) May worsen increased intracranial pressure and obscure its signs, such as level of consciousness or pupillary signs. (5.6) May cause hypotension, use with caution in patients at increased risk of hypotension and in patients in circulatory shock. (5.7) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects (5.8) Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.9) Use with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. (5.10) Use with caution in patients at risk for ileus. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients. (5.10) Tolerance may develop. (5.11) Use with caution in alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. (5.12) May impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. (5.13) No approved use in the treatment of addiction. (5.14) Not every urine drug test for "opioids" or "opiates" detects oxycodone reliably. (5.15) 5.1 Information Essential for Safe Administration <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in opioidtolerant patients . Use of these doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. 5.2 CNS Depression <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause somnolence, dizziness, alterations in judgment and alterations in levels of consciousness, including coma. 5.3 Interactions with Alcohol, CNS Depressants and Illicit Drugs Hypotension, profound sedation, coma or respiratory depression may result if <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is added to a regimen that includes other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). Therefore, use caution when deciding to initiate therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are taking other CNS depressants. Take into account the types of other medications being taken, the duration of therapy with them, and the patients response to those medicines, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Consider the patients use, if any, of alcohol andor illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is made, start with a lower <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose than usual. see Drug Interactions (7.3) Consider using a lower initial dose of a CNS depressant when given to a patient currently taking <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> due to the potential of additive CNS depressant effects. 5.4 Respiratory Depression Decreased respiratory drive resulting in respiratory depression is the chief hazard from the use or abuse of opioid agonists, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. The risk of opioidinduced respiratory depression is increased, for example, in elderly see Use In Specific Populations (8.5) or debilitated patients following large initial doses in any patient who is not tolerant to the respiratorydepressant or sedating effects of opioids or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that either depress respiratory drive or consciousness. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with extreme caution in patients with any of the following significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale other risk of substantially decreased respiratory reserve hypoxia hypercapnia preexisting respiratory depression Respiratory depression induced by opioids typically follows a pattern entailing first a shift in CO2 responsiveness of the CNS respiratory drive center, which results in a decrease in the urge to breathe, despite the presence of hypercapnia. The increase in brain CO2 can result in sedation that can accentuate the sedation from the opioid itself. Profound sedation, unresponsiveness, infrequent deep ("sighing") breaths or atypical snoring frequently accompany opioidinduced respiratory depression. Eventually, hypoxia ensues. In addition to further decreasing consciousness, hypoxia, along with hypercapnia, can predispose to lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5 Seizures Oxycodone, as with other opioids, may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorders. 5.6 Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention, which can lead to an elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. This effect may be exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone may produce miosis that is independent of ambient light, and altered consciousness, either of which may obscure neurologic signs associated with increased intracranial pressure in persons with head injuries. 5.7 Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Administer <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.8 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. The expected clinical results with CYP3A4 inhibitors would be an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and possibly increased or prolonged opioid effects. The expected clinical results with CYP3A4 inducers would be a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12) . 5.9 Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics It is generally not advisable to administer mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) to a patient receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 5.10 Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease and Other Gastrointestinal Conditions Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. The administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in patients who are at risk of developing ileus. 5.11 Tolerance Tolerance to opioids is demonstrated by the need for increasing doses to maintain adequate analgesic effect (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). If tolerance develops, or if pain severity increases, a gradual increase in dose may be required. The first sign of tolerance is usually a reduced duration of effect. Tolerance to different effects of opioids may develop to varying degrees and at varying rates in a given individual. There is also interpatient variability in the rate and extent of tolerance that develops to various opioid effects, whether the effect is desirable (e.g., analgesia) or undesirable (e.g., nausea). 5.12 Special Risk Groups Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in the following conditions, due to increased risk of adverse reactions alcoholism delirium tremens adrenocortical insufficiency CNS depression debilitation kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory compromise myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients accordingly. 5.14 Use in Addiction Treatment <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has no approved use in the treatment of addiction. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol addiction (substance dependence), either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for "opioids" or "opiates" detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified "cutoff" value as "negative". Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and use caution in interpreting results.</td></tr>

Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested ( 8 mgkgday).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone, which can enhance absorption Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) Single Dose 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 15 mg 196 28 16.8 29 4.59 19 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 30 mg 377 24 34.6 21 4.61 19 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 60 mg 705 22 64.6 24 4.15 26 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics Avoid use with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because they may reduce analgesic effect of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.4) 7.1 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, or death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4). 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 2D6 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could me more pronounced with concomitant use of CYP2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 7.4 Mixed AgonistAntagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 7.5 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Opioids may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention andor severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The high drug content in extendedrelease formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. 9.2 Abuse All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Drug abuse is the intentional nontherapeutic use of an overthecounter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug abuse includes, but is not limited to, the following examples the use of a prescription or overthecounter drug to get high, or the use of steroids for performance enhancement and muscle build up. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to reduce abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is for oral use only. Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. With parenteral abuse, the inactive ingredients in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Abuse Deterrence Studies <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is formulated with inactive ingredients intended to make the tablet more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. For the purposes of describing the results of studies of the abusedeterrent characteristics of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> resulting from a change in formulation, in this section, the original formulation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, which is no longer marketed, will be referred to as original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and the reformulated, currently marketed product will be referred to as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>". In Vitro Testing In vitro physical and chemical tablet manipulation studies were performed to evaluate the success of different extraction methods in defeating the extendedrelease formulation. Results support that, relative to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, there is an increase in the ability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to resist crushing, breaking, and dissolution using a variety of tools and solvents. The results of these studies also support this finding for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> relative to an immediaterelease oxycodone. When subjected to an aqueous environment, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle. Clinical Studies In a randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled 5period crossover pharmacodynamic study, 30 recreational opioid users with a history of intranasal drug abuse received intranasally administered active and placebo drug treatments. The five treatment arms were finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, coarsely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 30 mg tablets, powdered oxycodone HCl 30 mg, and placebo. Data for finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, and powdered oxycodone HCl are described below. Drug liking was measured on a bipolar drug liking scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response of neither liking nor disliking, 0 represents maximum disliking and 100 represents maximum liking. Response to whether the subject would take the study drug again was also measured on a bipolar scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response, 0 represents the strongest negative response (definitely would not take drug again) and 100 represents the strongest positive response (definitely would take drug again). Twentyseven of the subjects completed the study. Incomplete dosing due to granules falling from the subjects nostrils occurred in 34 (n  10) of subjects with finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, compared with 7 (n  2) of subjects with finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and no subjects with powdered oxycodone HCl. The intranasal administration of finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was associated with a numerically lower mean and median drug liking score and a lower mean and median score for take drug again, compared to finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or powdered oxycodone HCl as summarized in Table 2. Table 2 Summary of Maximum Drug Liking (Emax) Data Following Intranasal Administration  Bipolar scales (0  maximum negative response, 50  neutral response, 100  maximum positive response) VAS Scale (100 mm) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (finely crushed) Original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (finely crushed) Oxycodone HCl (powdered) Drug Liking Mean (SE) 80.4 (3.9) 94.0 (2.7) 89.3 (3.1) Median (Range) 88 (36100) 100 (51100) 100 (50100) Take Drug Again Mean (SE) 64.0 (7.1) 89.6 (3.9) 86.6 (4.4) Median (Range) 78 (0100) 100 (20100) 100 (0100) Figure 1 demonstrates a comparison of drug liking for finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> compared to powdered oxycodone HCl in subjects who received both treatments. The Yaxis represents the percent of subjects attaining a percent reduction in drug liking for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> vs. oxycodone HCl powder greater than or equal to the value on the Xaxis. Approximately 44 (n  12) had no reduction in liking with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> relative to oxycodone HCl. Approximately 56 (n  15) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> relative to oxycodone HCl. Thirtythree percent (n  9) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30 in drug liking with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> compared to oxycodone HCl, and approximately 22 (n  6) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50 in drug liking with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> compared to oxycodone HCl. Figure 1 Percent Reduction Profiles for Emax of Drug Liking VAS for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> vs. oxycodone HCl, N27 Following Intranasal Administration The results of a similar analysis of drug liking for finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> relative to finely crushed original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> were comparable to the results of finely crushed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> relative to powdered oxycodone HCl. Approximately 43 (n  12) of subjects had no reduction in liking with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> relative to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Approximately 57 (n  16) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking, 36 (n  10) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30 in drug liking, and approximately 29 (n  8) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50 in drug liking with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> compared to original <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Summary The in vitro data demonstrate that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has physicochemical properties expected to make abuse via injection difficult. The data from the clinical study, along with support from the in vitro data, also indicate that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce abuse via the intranasal route. However, abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by these routes, as well as by the oral route, is still possible. Additional data, including epidemiological data, when available, may provide further information on the impact of the current formulation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> on the abuse liability of the drug. Accordingly, this section may be updated in the future as appropriate. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1). 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.4). If <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abruptly discontinued in a physicallydependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs see Use in Specific Populations (8.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (oxycodone hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets) is an opioid analgesic supplied in 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablets for oral administration. The tablet strengths describe the amount of oxycodone per tablet as the hydrochloride salt. The structural formula for oxycodone hydrochloride is as follows The chemical name is 4, 5epoxy14hydroxy3methoxy17methylmorphinan6one hydrochloride. Oxycodone is a white, odorless crystalline powder derived from the opium alkaloid, thebaine. Oxycodone hydrochloride dissolves in water (1 g in 6 to 7 mL). It is slightly soluble in alcohol (octanol water partition coefficient 0.7). The 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg tablets contain the following inactive ingredients butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene oxide, magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide. The 10 mg tablets also contain hydroxypropyl cellulose. The 15 mg tablets also contain black iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, and red iron oxide. The 20 mg tablets also contain polysorbate 80 and red iron oxide. The 30 mg tablets also contain polysorbate 80, red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, and black iron oxide. The 40 mg tablets also contain polysorbate 80 and yellow iron oxide. The 60 mg tablets also contain polysorbate 80, red iron oxide and black iron oxide. The 80 mg tablets also contain hydroxypropyl cellulose, yellow iron oxide and FDC Blue 2Indigo Carmine Aluminum Lake.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. (2.1) For opioidnave and opioid nontolerant patients, initiate with 10 mg tablets orally every 12 hours. (2.1) Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a physically dependent patient. (2.4) Tablets must be swallowed intact and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.5, 5.1) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.5, 5.9, 17) 2.1 Initial Dosing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 2472 hours of initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information (17). Crushing, chewing, or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with one 10 mg tablet orally every 12 hours. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg orally every 12 hours. Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Conversion from other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by administering onehalf of the patients total daily oral oxycodone dose as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours. Conversion from other Opioids to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> defined by clinical trials. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg orally every 12 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patients 24hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediaterelease opioid) than to overestimate the 24hour oral oxycodone requirements which could result in adverse reactions. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial interpatient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products. Conversion from Methadone to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long halflife and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.2 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiverfamily during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediaterelease analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioidrelated adverse reactions. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 2.4 Discontinuation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets, use a gradual downward titration of the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 2.5 Administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Instruct patients to swallow <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Instruct patients to take <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> one tablet at a time and with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Patient Counseling Information (17)."</td></tr>

The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock see Overdosage (10).

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone hydrochloride is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife (t) of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3). Given the short elimination t of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see Drug Interactions (7.3). Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weightadjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use in Specific Populations (8.8). Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 170 and 100, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and Cmax values by 86 and 63, respectively see Drug Interactions (7.3). CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> see Drug Interactions (7.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers Oxycodone has been detected in human milk. Closely monitor infants of nursing women receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. (8.3) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetalneonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Teratogenic Effects  Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Do not initiate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal signs can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, opioidnave females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6.

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be administered as directed in the products prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10). Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective drug effect, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients see Dosage and Administration (2.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression and death. If coadminstration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs. (5.4) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease Monitor closely because of increased risk for lifethreatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effects Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.7) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.9) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects. (5.14) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9). As modifiedrelease products such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9). Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patients risk for opioid addiction, abuse or misuse prior to prescribing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, and monitor all patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modifiedrelease opioid formulations such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death see Overdosage (10). Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug see Patient Counseling Information (17). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 LifeThreatening Respiratory Depression Serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modifiedrelease opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patients clinical status see Overdosage (10). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioidinduced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, lifethreatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are essential see Dosage and Administration (2). Overestimating the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension and profound sedation, coma, or respiratory depression may result if <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is used concomitantly with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patients response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patients use of alcohol or illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is made, start with 13 to 12 the usual dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.2). 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Lifethreatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Hypotensive Effects <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) see Drug Interactions (7.1). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In patients with circulatory shock, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonistantagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In these patients, mixed agonistantagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, gradually taper the dose see Dosage and Administration (2.4). Do not abruptly discontinue <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid effects. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for opioids or opiates detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified cutoff value as negative. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are designed to provide controlled delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Breaking, chewing or crushing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets eliminates the controlled delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is pH independent. Oxycodone is well absorbed from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets with an oral bioavailability of 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing in normal volunteers in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Dose proportionality andor bioavailability has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC). Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. The administration of oxycodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Interactions with other CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used with caution and started in a reduced dosage (13 to 12 of the usual dosage) in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for preemptive analgesia (administration preoperatively for the management of postoperative pain). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting has not been established. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the postoperative period if the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (See American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented. Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level. Tolerance and Physical Dependence Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy ). Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver 1.Patients should be aware that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. 2.Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets will release all their contents at once if broken, chewed, or crushed, resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. 3.Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. 4.Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> without consulting the prescribing professional. 5.Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). 6.Patients should not combine <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. 7.Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. 8.Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. 9.Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. 10.Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. 11.Patients should be instructed to keep <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a secure place out of the reach of children. When <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addictive disorders. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence, either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Although clinical studies have not been conducted, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inducers of CYP3A4 Although clinical studies have not been conducted, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug, which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy, or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inducers. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance with this agent. Clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction, however. Use with CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies of oxycodone to evaluate its carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Oxycodone was not mutagenic in the following assays Ames Salmonella and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at doses of up to 5000 g, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes in the absence of metabolic activation at doses of up to 1500 gmL and with activation 48 hours after exposure at doses of up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in mice (at plasma levels of up to 48 gmL). Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation in the human chromosomal aberration test (at greater than or equal to 1250 gmL) at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure and in the mouse lymphoma assay at doses of 50 gmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 gmL or greater without metabolic activation. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively. These doses are 3 and 46 times a human dose of 160 mgday, based on mgkg basis. The results did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery. Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of oxycodone have been detected in breast milk. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because of the possibility of sedation andor respiratory depression in the infant. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18. It must be remembered that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets cannot be crushed or divided for administration. Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Laboratory Monitoring Due to the broad range of plasma concentrations seen in clinical populations, the varying degrees of pain, and the development of tolerance, plasma oxycodone measurements are usually not helpful in clinical management. Plasma concentrations of the active drug substance may be of value in selected, unusual or complex cases. Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment indicates greater plasma concentrations than those with normal function. The initiation of therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and careful dose titration is warranted. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. Dosages should be adjusted according to the clinical situation. Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation and in theory can be affected by drugs affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes. Oxycodone is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 to oxymorphone which represents less than 15 of the total administered dose. This route of elimination may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants). However, in a study involving 10 subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged., DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is NOT intended for use as a prn analgesic. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case, initiating therapy at the appropriate point along a progression from nonopioid analgesics, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acetaminophen to opioids in a plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly known as the Agency for HealthCare Policy and Research), the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines, or the American Pain Society. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 1224 hours following surgery), or if the pain is mild, or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate. (See American Pain Society guidelines.)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. In normal volunteers, the t of absorption is 0.4 hours for immediaterelease oral oxycodone. In contrast, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets exhibit a biphasic absorption pattern with two apparent absorption halflives of 0.6 and 6.9 hours, which describes the initial release of oxycodone from the tablet followed by a prolonged release., Plasma Oxycodone by Time Dose proportionality has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 1 below). Another study established that the 160 mg tablet is bioequivalent to 2 x 80 mg tablets as well as to 4 x 40 mg for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2 below). Given the short halflife of elimination of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Data from a study involving 21 normal volunteers show that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets administered per rectum resulted in an AUC 39 greater and a Cmax 9 higher than tablets administered by mouth. Therefore, there is an increased risk of adverse events with rectal administration. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Figure, Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. However, the peak plasma concentration of oxycodone increased by 25 when a <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg Tablet was administered with a highfat meal., Distribution Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk (see PRECAUTIONS )., Metabolism Oxycodone hydrochloride is extensively metabolized to noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone, and their glucuronides. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation (to noroxycodone) is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation (to oxymorphone). Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions )., Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free oxycodone up to 19 conjugated oxycodone up to 50 free oxymorphone 0 conjugated oxymorphone  14 both free and conjugated noroxycodone have been found in the urine but not quantified. The total plasma clearance was 0.8 Lmin for adults., SAFETY AND HANDLING <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are solid dosage forms that contain oxycodone which is a controlled substance.

In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Serious adverse reactions which may be associated with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablet therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, and (to an even lesser degree) circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock (see OVERDOSAGE ). The nonserious adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are typical opioid side effects. These events are dosedependent, and their frequency depends upon the dose, the clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent (5) include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and asthenia. In many cases the frequency of these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large swings in the plasma concentrations of the opioid. Many of these adverse events will cease or decrease in intensity as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed. Clinical trials comparing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with immediaterelease oxycodone and placebo revealed a similar adverse event profile between <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and immediaterelease oxycodone. The most common adverse events (5) reported by patients at least once during therapy were TABLE 3 <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (n227) ImmediateRelease (n225) Placebo (n45) () () () Constipation (23) (26) (7) Nausea (23) (27) (11) Somnolence (23) (24) (4) Dizziness (13) (16) (9) Pruritus (13) (12) (2) Vomiting (12) (14) (7) Headache (7) (8) (7) Dry Mouth (6) (7) (2) Asthenia (6) (7)  Sweating (5) (6) (2) The following adverse experiences were reported in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>treated patients with an incidence between 1 and 5. In descending order of frequency they were anorexia, nervousness, insomnia, fever, confusion, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, rash, anxiety, euphoria, dyspnea, postural hypotension, chills, twitching, gastritis, abnormal dreams, thought abnormalities, and hiccups.

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to oxycodone, or in any situation where opioids are contraindicated. This includes patients with significant respiratory depression (in unmonitored settings or the absence of resuscitative equipment), and patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in any patient who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Principles <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO MORPHINE. OXYCODONE, LIKE MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN ANALGESIA, CAN BE ABUSED AND IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be started on the lowest appropriate dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiation of Therapy ). In treating pain it is vital to assess the patient regularly and systematically. Therapy should also be regularly reviewed and adjusted based upon the patients own reports of pain and side effects and the health professionals clinical judgment. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The controlledrelease nature of the formulation allows <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to be effectively administered every 12 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). While symmetric (same dose AM and PM), aroundtheclock, q12h dosing is appropriate for the majority of patients, some patients may benefit from asymmetric (different dose given in AM than in PM) dosing, tailored to their pain pattern. It is usually appropriate to treat a patient with only one opioid for aroundtheclock therapy. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING ). Initiation of Therapy It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior opioid and nonopioid analgesic treatment. Attention should be given to 1.the general condition and medical status of the patient 2.the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking 3.the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone 4.the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) 5.the Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg and 6.the balance between pain control and adverse experiences. Care should be taken to use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS DrugDrug Interactions ). For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios from Foley, KM. NEJM, 1985 3138495, found below, are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg q12h. If a nonopioid analgesic is being provided, it may be continued. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. 1.Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 4 below), multiply the mgday of the previous opioids by the appropriate multiplication factors to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. 2.When converting from oxycodone, divide the 24hour oxycodone dose in half to obtain the twice a day (q12h) dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. 3.Round down to a dose which is appropriate for the tablet strengths available. 4.Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. 5.No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. The recommended doses shown in Table 4 are only a starting point, and close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 4. Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Prior Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (MgDay Prior Opioid x Factor  MgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Prior Opioid Parenteral Prior Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 In all cases, supplemental analgesia should be made available in the form of a suitable shortacting analgesic. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be safely used concomitantly with usual doses of nonopioid analgesics and analgesic adjuvants, provided care is taken to select a proper initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg q12h of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 ghr fentanyl transdermal patch. The patient should be followed closely for early titration, as there is very limited clinical experience with this conversion. Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Experiences Most patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative andor stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids. Other opioidrelated side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually selflimited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered. Patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence. Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose at each increase. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiverfamily. Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg Tablets or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg (for use in opioidtolerant patients only) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, are for use in opioidtolerant patients only. A single daily dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets. Supplemental Analgesia Most patients given aroundtheclock therapy with controlledrelease opioids may need to have immediaterelease medication available for exacerbations of pain or to prevent pain that occurs predictably during certain patient activities (incident pain). Maintenance of Therapy The intent of the titration period is to establish a patientspecific q12h dose that will maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects for as long as pain relief is necessary. Should pain recur then the dose can be incrementally increased to reestablish pain control. The method of therapy adjustment outlined above should be employed to reestablish pain control. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, conservative dose conversion ratios should be followed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a full muagonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive use, use for nonmedical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, has been diverted for nonmedical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> consists of a dualpolymer matrix, intended for oral use only. Abuse of the crushed tablet poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients, especially talc, can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard from oxycodone, the active ingredient in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as with all opioid agonists. Respiratory depression is a particular problem in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative nonopioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphinetype, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver 1.Patients should be aware that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. 2.Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets will release all their contents at once if broken, chewed, or crushed, resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. 3.Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. 4.Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> without consulting the prescribing professional. 5.Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). 6.Patients should not combine <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. 7.Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. 8.Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. 9.Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. 10.Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms.

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease) Tablets are an opioid analgesic supplied in 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for oral administration. The tablet strengths describe the amount of oxycodone per tablet as the hydrochloride salt. The structural formula for oxycodone hydrochloride is as follows The chemical formula is 4, 5epoxy14hydroxy3methoxy17methylmorphinan6one hydrochloride.

A single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been reported as being abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death (see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ). Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Oxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure agonist opioid whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonistantagonists or nonopioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdose (See OVERDOSAGE ). Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for analgesia will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Experience Relationships <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are associated with typical opioidrelated adverse experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse experiences such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant. As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL TRIALS A doubleblind placebocontrolled, fixeddose, parallel group, twoweek study was conducted in 133 patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain, who were judged as having inadequate pain control with their current therapy. In this study, 20 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h but not 10 mg <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> q12h decreased pain compared with placebo, and this difference was statistically significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects., Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of oxycodone overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered.

Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6.

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups. see Nonclinical Toxicology (13) NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis).

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration Over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination halflife of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use In Specific Populations (8.3) . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions) . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration in to the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly (65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use In Specific Populations (8.8) . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation followed by CYP2B6, CYP2C919 and CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxymorphone is a minor metabolite, its formation is catalyzed primarily by CYP2D6 and to a small extent by CYP2C19. The formation of oxymorphone may be blocked by a variety of drugs (such as antipsychotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, etc.) that inhibit these enzymes. However, in a study involving ten subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of CYP2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone. see Drug Interactions (7.2)</td></tr>

Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance during oxycodone treatment. 7.3 CNS Depressants Start <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other CNS depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ) 7.4 Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should generally not be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. Neonates whose mothers have been taking opioids chronically may also exhibit withdrawal signs, either at birth andor in the nursery, because they have developed physical dependence. This is not, however, synonymous with addiction see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) . Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. 9.2 Abuse Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Opioid drugs are sought by people with substance use disorders (abuse or addiction, the latter of which is also called "substance dependence") and criminals who supply them by diverting medicines out of legitimate distribution channels. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a target for theft and diversion. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drugseeking tactics include, but are not limited to, emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, altering or forging of prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among people with untreated substance use disorders, and criminals who divert controlled substances. The risks of misuse and abuse should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Concerns about abuse and addiction, should not prevent the proper management of pain, however. Treatment of pain should be individualized, balancing the potential benefits and risks for each patient. Compromising an extended or controlledrelease delivery system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The risk of fatal overdose is further increased when oxycodone is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive abuse, repeated use for nonmedical purposes, loss of control over intake, craving of psychic effects and continued abuse despite harm or risk of harm in medical, social, legal or occupational domains. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, but relapse is common. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by intentional misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been diverted for nonmedical use. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, proper dispensing and correct storage and handling are appropriate measures that help to limit misuse and abuse of opioid drugs. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence to an opioid is manifested by characteristic withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug, significant dose reduction or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome in adults is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, piloerection, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use low initial doses in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other central nervous system (CNS) active medications. (2.2) For patients already receiving opioids, use standard conversion ratio estimates. (2.2) Tablets must be swallowed whole and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.1) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.1, 17.1) 2.1 Safe Administration Instructions <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time. Take each tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) . Selection of patients for treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, Federation of State Medical Boards Model Policy, and the American Pain Society. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring. 2.2 Initiating Therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually. Attention should be given to risk factors for abuse or addiction including whether the patient has a previous or current substance abuse problem, a family history of substance abuse, or a history of mental illness or depression the age, general condition and medical status of the patient the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone the special instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg see Dosage and Administration (2.7)  and the balance between pain control and adverse reactions. Use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3). Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg every 12 hours. Individually titrate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions while maintaining an everytwelvehour dosing regimen. For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios found in Table 1 are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. A reasonable approach for converting from existing opioid therapy to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is as follows Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 1), multiply the mgday of each of the current opioids to be converted by their appropriate multiplication factor to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. Divide the calculated 24hour oxycodone dose in half to approximate the every 12hour dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablet strengths available. Close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 1 Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Current Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone1  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (mgDay Opioid x Factor  mgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Opioid Parenteral Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 2.3 Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.4 Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 2.5 Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Reactions Most patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience adverse reactions. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids, therefore, anticipate constipation and treat aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative with or without a stool softener. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, consider treatment with antiemetics or other modalities to relieve these symptoms. 2.6 Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, assess pain relief and other opioid effects frequently. Titrate patients to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. Increase the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose by increasing the total daily dose, not by changing the 12hour dosing interval. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse reactions. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, maintain frequent contact between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and, with proper consent, the caregiverfamily. 2.7 Special Instructions for Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant Do not begin treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg in patients who are not already tolerant to the respiratorydepressant and sedating effects of opioids. Use of these doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. These doses are only for use in opioidtolerant patients. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Instruct patients not to share or permit use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. 2.8 Continuation of Therapy During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, reassess the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy regularly (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. 2.9 Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, taper the dose gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physicallydependent patient. 2.10 Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, follow conservative dose conversion ratios. When converting from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to parenteral opioids, it is advisable to calculate an equivalent parenteral dose and then initiate treatment at half of this calculated value."</td></tr>

The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock see Overdosage (10) .

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure mu receptor opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, hydrocodone and oxymorphone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Increasing doses of pure mu receptor agonists are associated with increasing analgesia. There is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by adverse reactions, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose See Overdosage (10) . Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Endocrine System Opioids may influence the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal or gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. Immune System In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions, depending on the context in which they are used. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration Over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination halflife of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations. TABLE 3 Mean  coefficient of variation Regimen Dosage Form AUC (nghrmL)  Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr)  for singledose AUC  AUC0inf data obtained while subjects received naltrexone which can enhance absorption Single Dose 10 mg 136 27 11.5 27 5.11 21 15 mg 196 28 16.8 29 4.59 19 20 mg 248 25 22.7 25 4.63 22 30 mg 377 24 34.6 21 4.61 19 40 mg 497 27 47.4 30 4.40 22 60 mg 705 22 64.6 24 4.15 26 80 mg 908 21 87.1 29 4.27 26 Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use In Specific Populations (8.3) . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions) . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration in to the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly (65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use In Specific Populations (8.8) . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation followed by CYP2B6, CYP2C919 and CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxymorphone is a minor metabolite, its formation is catalyzed primarily by CYP2D6 and to a small extent by CYP2C19. The formation of oxymorphone may be blocked by a variety of drugs (such as antipsychotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, etc.) that inhibit these enzymes. However, in a study involving ten subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of CYP2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone. see Drug Interactions (7.2)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>abuse</i>:</td><td>9.2 Abuse Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Opioid drugs are sought by people with substance use disorders (abuse or addiction, the latter of which is also called "substance dependence") and criminals who supply them by diverting medicines out of legitimate distribution channels. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a target for theft and diversion. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drugseeking tactics include, but are not limited to, emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, altering or forging of prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among people with untreated substance use disorders, and criminals who divert controlled substances. The risks of misuse and abuse should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Concerns about abuse and addiction, should not prevent the proper management of pain, however. Treatment of pain should be individualized, balancing the potential benefits and risks for each patient. Compromising an extended or controlledrelease delivery system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The risk of fatal overdose is further increased when oxycodone is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive abuse, repeated use for nonmedical purposes, loss of control over intake, craving of psychic effects and continued abuse despite harm or risk of harm in medical, social, legal or occupational domains. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, but relapse is common. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by intentional misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been diverted for nonmedical use. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, proper dispensing and correct storage and handling are appropriate measures that help to limit misuse and abuse of opioid drugs. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</td></tr>

(8.3) Pediatrics Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established. (8.4) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to  of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) Renal impairment Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups. see Nonclinical Toxicology (13) NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. Neonates whose mothers have been taking opioids chronically may also exhibit withdrawal signs, either at birth andor in the nursery, because they have developed physical dependence. This is not, however, synonymous with addiction see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) . Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Do not initiate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to  the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>

Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6.

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. It is important to take the pharmacokinetic profile of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> into account when treating overdose. Even in the face of improvement, continued medical monitoring is required because of the possibility of extended effects as opioid continues to be absorbed from ingested tablets. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of whole <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets, and with abuse and misuse by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdosage, primary attention should be given to the maintenance of a patent airway, and of effective ventilation (clearance of CO2) and oxygenation, whether by spontaneous, assisted or controlled respiration. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Since the duration of action of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may exceed that of the antagonist, especially when the overdose involves intact tablets, keep the patient under continued surveillance and administer repeated doses of the antagonist according to the antagonist labeling as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Do not administer opioid antagonists in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt partial or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence (or withdrawal) syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. See the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of its proper use.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose See Overdosage (10) . Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Endocrine System Opioids may influence the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal or gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. Immune System In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions, depending on the context in which they are used. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dependence</i>:</td><td>9.3 Dependence Physical dependence to an opioid is manifested by characteristic withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug, significant dose reduction or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome in adults is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, piloerection, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. See Use In Specific Populations (8.2) In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.9) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Must be swallowed whole (5.1) May cause somnolence, dizziness, alterations in judgment and alterations in levels of consciousness, including coma. (5.2) Additive CNS effects are expected when used with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.1, 5.3, 7.3) Use with caution in patients who are receiving other CNS depressants. (5.1, 5.3, 7.3) May cause respiratory depression, use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression, elderly and debilitated patients (5.4) May aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. (5.5) May worsen increased intracranial pressure and obscure its signs, such as level of consciousness or pupillary signs. (5.6) May cause hypotension, use with caution in patients at increased risk of hypotension and in patients in circulatory shock. (5.7) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects (5.8) Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.9) Use with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. (5.10) Use with caution in patients at risk for ileus. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients. (5.10) Tolerance may develop. (5.11) Use with caution in alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. (5.12) May impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. (5.13) No approved use in the treatment of addiction. (5.14) Not every urine drug test for "opioids" or "opiates" detects oxycodone reliably. (5.15) 5.1 Information Essential for Safe Administration <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in opioidtolerant patients . Use of these doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. 5.2 CNS Depression <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause somnolence, dizziness, alterations in judgment and alterations in levels of consciousness, including coma. 5.3 Interactions with Alcohol, CNS Depressants and Illicit Drugs Hypotension, profound sedation, coma or respiratory depression may result if <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is added to a regimen that includes other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). Therefore, use caution when deciding to initiate therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are taking other CNS depressants. Take into account the types of other medications being taken, the duration of therapy with them, and the patients response to those medicines, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Consider the patients use, if any, of alcohol andor illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is made, start with a lower <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose than usual. see Drug Interactions (7.3) Consider using a lower initial dose of a CNS depressant when given to a patient currently taking <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> due to the potential of additive CNS depressant effects. 5.4 Respiratory Depression Decreased respiratory drive resulting in respiratory depression is the chief hazard from the use or abuse of opioid agonists, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. The risk of opioidinduced respiratory depression is increased, for example, in elderly see Use In Specific Populations (8.5) or debilitated patients following large initial doses in any patient who is not tolerant to the respiratorydepressant or sedating effects of opioids or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that either depress respiratory drive or consciousness. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with extreme caution in patients with any of the following significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale other risk of substantially decreased respiratory reserve hypoxia hypercapnia preexisting respiratory depression Respiratory depression induced by opioids typically follows a pattern entailing first a shift in CO2 responsiveness of the CNS respiratory drive center, which results in a decrease in the urge to breathe, despite the presence of hypercapnia. The increase in brain CO2 can result in sedation that can accentuate the sedation from the opioid itself. Profound sedation, unresponsiveness, infrequent deep ("sighing") breaths or atypical snoring frequently accompany opioidinduced respiratory depression. Eventually, hypoxia ensues. In addition to further decreasing consciousness, hypoxia, along with hypercapnia, can predispose to lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5 Seizures Oxycodone, as with other opioids, may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorders. 5.6 Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention, which can lead to an elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. This effect may be exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone may produce miosis that is independent of ambient light, and altered consciousness, either of which may obscure neurologic signs associated with increased intracranial pressure in persons with head injuries. 5.7 Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Administer <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.8 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. The expected clinical results with CYP3A4 inhibitors would be an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and possibly increased or prolonged opioid effects. The expected clinical results with CYP3A4 inducers would be a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12) . 5.9 Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics It is generally not advisable to administer mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) to a patient receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 5.10 Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease and Other Gastrointestinal Conditions Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. The administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in patients who are at risk of developing ileus. 5.11 Tolerance Tolerance to opioids is demonstrated by the need for increasing doses to maintain adequate analgesic effect (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). If tolerance develops, or if pain severity increases, a gradual increase in dose may be required. The first sign of tolerance is usually a reduced duration of effect. Tolerance to different effects of opioids may develop to varying degrees and at varying rates in a given individual. There is also interpatient variability in the rate and extent of tolerance that develops to various opioid effects, whether the effect is desirable (e.g., analgesia) or undesirable (e.g., nausea). 5.12 Special Risk Groups Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in the following conditions, due to increased risk of adverse reactions alcoholism delirium tremens adrenocortical insufficiency CNS depression debilitation kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory compromise myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients accordingly. 5.14 Use in Addiction Treatment <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has no approved use in the treatment of addiction. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol addiction (substance dependence), either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for "opioids" or "opiates" detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified "cutoff" value as "negative". Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and use caution in interpreting results.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are designed to provide controlled delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets eliminates the controlled delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets is pH independent. Oxycodone is well absorbed from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets with an oral bioavailability of 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing in normal volunteers in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Dose proportionality andor bioavailability has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC). Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. In normal volunteers, the t of absorption is 0.4 hours for immediaterelease oral oxycodone. In contrast, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets exhibit a biphasic absorption pattern with two apparent absorption halflives of 0.6 and 6.9 hours, which describes the initial release of oxycodone from the tablet followed by a prolonged release. Plasma Oxycodone by Time Dose proportionality has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 1 below). Another study established that the 160 mg tablet is bioequivalent to 2 x 80 mg tablets as well as to 4 x 40 mg for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2 below). Given the short halflife of elimination of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Data from a study involving 21 normal volunteers show that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets administered per rectum resulted in an AUC 39 greater and a Cmax 9 higher than tablets administered by mouth. Therefore, there is an increased risk of adverse events with rectal administration. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Figure Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. However, the peak plasma concentration of oxycodone increased by 25 when a <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg Tablet was administered with a highfat meal. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk (see PRECAUTIONS ). Metabolism Oxycodone hydrochloride is extensively metabolized to noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone, and their glucuronides. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation (to noroxycodone) is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation (to oxymorphone). Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions ). Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free oxycodone up to 19 conjugated oxycodone up to 50 free oxymorphone 0 conjugated oxymorphone  14 both free and conjugated noroxycodone have been found in the urine but not quantified. The total plasma clearance was 0.8 Lmin for adults. Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ). DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation and can be affected by drugs affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxycodone is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 to oxymorphone which represents less than 15 of the total administered dose. This route of elimination may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants). However, in a study involving 10 subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone. Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. Twenty and 30 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> were superior in reducing pain compared with placebo, and this difference was statistically significant. The onset of analgesic action with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> occurred within 1 hour in most patients following oral administration.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. The administration of oxycodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Interactions with other CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be used with caution and started in a reduced dosage (13 to 12 of the usual dosage) in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for preemptive analgesia (administration preoperatively for the management of postoperative pain). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting has not been established. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not indicated for pain in the postoperative period if the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (See American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented. Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level. Tolerance and Physical Dependence Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy ). Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients accordingly. Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver Patients should be aware that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets will release all their contents at once if cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> without consulting the prescribing professional. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. Patients should be advised that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. Patients should be instructed to keep <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in a secure place out of the reach of children. When <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addictive disorders. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence, either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. A published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Although clinical studies have not been conducted with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug, which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy, or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inducers. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance during oxycodone treatment. Use with CNS Depressants <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies of oxycodone to evaluate its carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Oxycodone was not mutagenic in the following assays Ames Salmonella and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at doses of up to 5000 g, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes in the absence of metabolic activation at doses of up to 1500 gmL and with activation 48 hours after exposure at doses of up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in mice (at plasma levels of up to 48 gmL). Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation in the human chromosomal aberration test (at greater than or equal to 1250 gmL) at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure and in the mouse lymphoma assay at doses of 50 gmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 gmL or greater without metabolic activation. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively. These doses are 3 and 46 times a human dose of 160 mgday, based on mgkg basis. The results did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery. Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of oxycodone have been detected in breast milk. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> because of the possibility of sedation andor respiratory depression in the infant. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18. It must be remembered that <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets cannot be crushed or divided for administration. Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Laboratory Monitoring Due to the broad range of plasma concentrations seen in clinical populations, the varying degrees of pain, and the development of tolerance, plasma oxycodone measurements are usually not helpful in clinical management. Plasma concentrations of the active drug substance may be of value in selected, unusual or complex cases. Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment indicates greater plasma concentrations than those with normal function. The initiation of therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and careful dose titration is warranted. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. Dosages should be adjusted according to the clinical situation. Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to oxycodone, or in any situation where opioids are contraindicated. This includes patients with significant respiratory depression (in unmonitored settings or the absence of resuscitative equipment), and patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is contraindicated in any patient who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Principles <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO MORPHINE. OXYCODONE, LIKE MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN ANALGESIA, CAN BE ABUSED AND IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissloved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be started on the lowest appropriate dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiation of Therapy ). In treating pain it is vital to assess the patient regularly and systematically. Therapy should also be regularly reviewed and adjusted based upon the patients own reports of pain and side effects and the health professionals clinical judgment. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The controlledrelease nature of the formulation allows <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to be effectively administered every 12 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). While symmetric (same dose AM and PM), aroundtheclock, q12h dosing is appropriate for the majority of patients, some patients may benefit from asymmetric (different dose given in AM than in PM) dosing, tailored to their pain pattern. It is usually appropriate to treat a patient with only one opioid for aroundtheclock therapy. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING ). Initiation of Therapy It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior opioid and nonopioid analgesic treatment. Attention should be given to (1)risk factors for abuse or addiction including whether the patient has a previous or current substance abuse problem, a family history of substance abuse, or a history of mental illness or depression (2)the age, general condition and medical status of the patient (3)the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking (4)the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone (5)the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) (6)the Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg and (7)the balance between pain control and adverse experiences. Care should be taken to use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS DrugDrug Interactions ). For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios from Foley, KM. NEJM, 1985 3138495, found below, are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg q12h. If a nonopioid analgesic is being provided, it may be continued. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 4 below), multiply the mgday of the previous opioids by the appropriate multiplication factors to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. When converting from oxycodone, divide the 24hour oxycodone dose in half to obtain the twice a day (q12h) dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down to a dose which is appropriate for the tablet strengths available. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. The recommended doses shown in Table 4 are only a starting point, and close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 4. Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Prior Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (MgDay Prior Opioid x Factor  MgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Prior Opioid Parenteral Prior Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 In all cases, supplemental analgesia should be made available in the form of a suitable shortacting analgesic. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be safely used concomitantly with usual doses of nonopioid analgesics and analgesic adjuvants, provided care is taken to select a proper initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg q12h of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 ghr fentanyl transdermal patch. The patient should be followed closely for early titration, as there is very limited clinical experience with this conversion. Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Experiences Most patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative andor stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids. Other opioidrelated side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually selflimited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered. Patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence. Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose at each increase. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiverfamily. Special Instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg (for use in opioidtolerant patients only) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in opioidtolerant patients, as they may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratorydepressant, or sedating effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. One <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets. Supplemental Analgesia Most patients given aroundtheclock therapy with controlledrelease opioids may need to have immediaterelease medication available for exacerbations of pain or to prevent pain that occurs predictably during certain patient activities (incident pain). Maintenance of Therapy The intent of the titration period is to establish a patientspecific q12h dose that will maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects for as long as pain relief is necessary. Should pain recur then the dose can be incrementally increased to reestablish pain control. The method of therapy adjustment outlined above should be employed to reestablish pain control. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, conservative dose conversion ratios should be followed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> contains oxycodone, which is a full muagonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive use, use for nonmedical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, like other opioids, has been diverted for nonmedical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> consists of a dualpolymer matrix, intended for oral use only. Abuse of the crushed tablet poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients, especially talc, can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard from oxycodone, the active ingredient in <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as with all opioid agonists. Respiratory depression is a particular problem in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative nonopioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphinetype, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>Labor and Delivery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery.</td></tr>

Follow your doctors directions exactly. Your doctor may change your dose based on your reactions to the medicine. Do not change your dose unless your doctor tells you to change it. Do not take <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> more often than prescribed. Swallow the tablets whole. Do not cut, break, crush, dissolve, or chew before swallowing. If the tablets are not whole, your body will absorb too much medicine at one time. This can lead to serious problems, including overdose and death. If you miss a dose , take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once unless your doctor tells you to. In case of overdose , call your local emergency number or Poison Control Center right away. Review your pain regularly with your doctor to determine if you still need <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. You may see tablets in your stools (bowel movements). Do not be concerned. Your body has already absorbed the medicine. If you continue to have pain or bothersome side effects, call your doctor. Stopping <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Consult your doctor for instructions on how to stop this medicine slowly to avoid uncomfortable symptoms.

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in opioidtolerant patients, as they may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been reported as being abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death (see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ). Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Oxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Serious adverse reactions which may be associated with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablet therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, and (to an even lesser degree) circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock (see OVERDOSAGE ). The nonserious adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> are typical opioid side effects. These events are dosedependent, and their frequency depends upon the dose, the clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent (5) include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and asthenia. In many cases the frequency of these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large swings in the plasma concentrations of the opioid. Many of these adverse events will cease or decrease in intensity as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed. Clinical trials comparing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with immediaterelease oxycodone and placebo revealed a similar adverse event profile between <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> and immediaterelease oxycodone.

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure agonist opioid whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonistantagonists or nonopioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdose (See OVERDOSAGE ). Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for analgesia will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Experience Relationships <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Tablets are associated with typical opioidrelated adverse experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse experiences such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant. As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL TRIALS A doubleblind placebocontrolled, fixeddose, parallel group, twoweek study was conducted in 133 patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain, who were judged as having inadequate pain control with their current therapy.

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects., Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of oxycodone overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered.

Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested (8 mgkgday).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) . NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration Over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination halflife of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use In Specific Populations (8.3) . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions) . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration in to the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly (65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use In Specific Populations (8.8) . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation followed by CYP2B6, CYP2C919 and CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxymorphone is a minor metabolite, its formation is catalyzed primarily by CYP2D6 and to a small extent by CYP2C19. The formation of oxymorphone may be blocked by a variety of drugs (such as antipsychotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, etc.) that inhibit these enzymes. However, in a study involving ten subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of CYP2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone see Drug Interactions (7.2) .</td></tr>

(7.1) The CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. (7.2) Concurrent use of other CNS depressants may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. (7.3) Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. (7.4) 7.1 Neuromuscular Junction Blocking Agents <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants (such as pancuronium) and produce an increased degree andor duration of respiratory depression. 7.2 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. A published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Although clinical studies have not been conducted with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. If coadministration with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance during oxycodone treatment. 7.3 CNS Depressants Start <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other CNS depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ) . 7.4 Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should generally not be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. Neonates whose mothers have been taking opioids chronically may also exhibit withdrawal signs, either at birth andor in the nursery, because they have developed physical dependence. This is not, however, synonymous with addiction see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) . Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</td></tr>

This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Opioid drugs are sought by people with substance use disorders (abuse or addiction, the latter of which is also called "substance dependence") and criminals who supply them by diverting medicines out of legitimate distribution channels. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a target for theft and diversion. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drugseeking tactics include, but are not limited to, emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, altering or forging of prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among people with untreated substance use disorders, and criminals who divert controlled substances. The risks of misuse and abuse should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Concerns about abuse and addiction, should not prevent the proper management of pain, however. Treatment of pain should be individualized, balancing the potential benefits and risks for each patient. Compromising an extended or controlledrelease delivery system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The risk of fatal overdose is further increased when oxycodone is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive abuse, repeated use for nonmedical purposes, loss of control over intake, craving of psychic effects and continued abuse despite harm or risk of harm in medical, social, legal or occupational domains. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, but relapse is common. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by intentional misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been diverted for nonmedical use. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, proper dispensing and correct storage and handling are appropriate measures that help to limit misuse and abuse of opioid drugs. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence to an opioid is manifested by characteristic withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug, significant dose reduction or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome in adults is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, piloerection, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate see Use In Specific Populations (8.2) .

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use low initial doses in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other central nervous system (CNS) active medications. (2.2) For patients already receiving opioids, use standard conversion ratio estimates. (2.2) Tablets must be swallowed whole and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). (2.1) <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. (2.1, 17.1) 2.1 Safe Administration Instructions <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets should be taken one tablet at a time. Take each tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) . Selection of patients for treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, Federation of State Medical Boards Model Policy, and the American Pain Society. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring. 2.2 Initiating Therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually. Attention should be given to risk factors for abuse or addiction including whether the patient has a previous or current substance abuse problem, a family history of substance abuse, or a history of mental illness or depression the age, general condition and medical status of the patient the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone the special instructions for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg see Dosage and Administration (2.7)  and the balance between pain control and adverse reactions. Use low initial doses of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are not already opioidtolerant see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3). Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg every 12 hours. Individually titrate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions while maintaining an everytwelvehour dosing regimen. For initiation of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios found in Table 1 are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. A reasonable approach for converting from existing opioid therapy to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is as follows Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy is initiated. Using standard conversion ratio estimates ( see Table 1 ), multiply the mgday of each of the current opioids to be converted by their appropriate multiplication factor to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. Divide the calculated 24hour oxycodone dose in half to approximate the every 12hour dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablet strengths available. Close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 1 Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Current Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone1  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (mgDay Opioid x Factor  mgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Opioid Parenteral Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 2.3 Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcghr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.4 Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 2.5 Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Reactions Most patients receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience adverse reactions. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids, therefore, anticipate constipation and treat aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative with or without a stool softener. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, consider treatment with antiemetics or other modalities to relieve these symptoms. 2.6 Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, assess pain relief and other opioid effects frequently. Titrate patients to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. There are no wellcontrolled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. Increase the <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose by increasing the total daily dose, not by changing the 12hour dosing interval. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse reactions are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse reactions. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, maintain frequent contact between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and, with proper consent, the caregiverfamily. 2.7 Special Instructions for Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant Do not begin treatment with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg in patients who are not already tolerant to the respiratorydepressant and sedating effects of opioids. Use of these doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. These doses are only for use in opioidtolerant patients. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg oral morphineday, 25 mcg transdermal fentanylhour, 30 mg oral oxycodoneday, 8 mg oral hydromorphoneday, 25 mg oral oxymorphoneday, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Instruct patients not to share or permit use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. 2.8 Continuation of Therapy During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, reassess the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy regularly (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. 2.9 Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, taper the dose gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physicallydependent patient. 2.10 Conversion from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, follow conservative dose conversion ratios. When converting from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to parenteral opioids, it is advisable to calculate an equivalent parenteral dose and then initiate treatment at half of this calculated value."</td></tr>

To report Suspected Adverse Reactions, contact Purdue Pharma L.P. at 18887267535 or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock see Overdosage (10) .

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure mu receptor opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, hydrocodone and oxymorphone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Increasing doses of pure mu receptor agonists are associated with increasing analgesia. There is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by adverse reactions, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10) . Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Endocrine System Opioids may influence the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal or gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. Immune System In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions, depending on the context in which they are used. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> impairs the controlledrelease delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> to that from immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone. Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration Over Time Dose proportionality has been established for <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination halflife of oxycodone, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In a study comparing 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediaterelease oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and Cmax, and similar for Cmin (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steadystate volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk see Use In Specific Populations (8.3) . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions) . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak antinociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the bloodbrain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites ( and oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration in to the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for ketoreduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9, free noroxycodone 23, free oxymorphone less than 1, conjugated oxymorphone 10, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 Lmin in adults. Special Populations Elderly (65 years) The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 2145). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25 higher than for male subjects on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown see Use In Specific Populations (8.8) . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. DrugDrug Interactions Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation followed by CYP2B6, CYP2C919 and CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. For example, a published study showed that the coadministration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and Cmax by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. A published study showed that the coadministration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and Cmax by 86 and 63, respectively. Oxymorphone is a minor metabolite, its formation is catalyzed primarily by CYP2D6 and to a small extent by CYP2C19. The formation of oxymorphone may be blocked by a variety of drugs (such as antipsychotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, etc.) that inhibit these enzymes. However, in a study involving ten subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of CYP2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged. The genetic expression of CYP2D6 may have some influence in the pharmacokinetic properties of oxycodone. The in vitro drugdrug interaction studies with noroxymorphone using human liver microsomes showed no significant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities which suggests that noroxymorphone may not alter the metabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with oxycodone see Drug Interactions (7.2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>abuse</i>:</td><td>9.2 Abuse Abuse of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with compromising the tablet and with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Opioid drugs are sought by people with substance use disorders (abuse or addiction, the latter of which is also called "substance dependence") and criminals who supply them by diverting medicines out of legitimate distribution channels. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is a target for theft and diversion. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drugseeking tactics include, but are not limited to, emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, altering or forging of prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among people with untreated substance use disorders, and criminals who divert controlled substances. The risks of misuse and abuse should be considered when prescribing or dispensing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Concerns about abuse and addiction, should not prevent the proper management of pain, however. Treatment of pain should be individualized, balancing the potential benefits and risks for each patient. Compromising an extended or controlledrelease delivery system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The risk of fatal overdose is further increased when oxycodone is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive abuse, repeated use for nonmedical purposes, loss of control over intake, craving of psychic effects and continued abuse despite harm or risk of harm in medical, social, legal or occupational domains. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, but relapse is common. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by intentional misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has been diverted for nonmedical use. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, proper dispensing and correct storage and handling are appropriate measures that help to limit misuse and abuse of opioid drugs. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Labor and Delivery Not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor and delivery (8.2) Nursing Mothers Nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. (8.3) Pediatrics Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established. (8.4) Geriatrics The initial dose may need to be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual doses. (8.5) Hepatic impairment Initiate therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and titrate carefully. (8.6) Renal impairment Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of oxycodone use during pregnancy. Based on limited human data in the literature, oxycodone does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicology studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, oxycodone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Teratogenic Effects The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mgkgday and rabbits up to 125 mgkgday, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, respectively on a mgm2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no longterm developmental or reproductive effects in the pups see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) . NonTeratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drugrelated effects on reproductive performance in these females or any longterm developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early postweaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mgkgday, equivalent to approximately 0.4times an adult human dose of 160 mgday, on a mgm2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to and during labor, when use of shorteracting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression. Have a specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, available for reversal of opioidinduced respiratory depression in the neonate. Neonates whose mothers have been taking opioids chronically may also exhibit withdrawal signs, either at birth andor in the nursery, because they have developed physical dependence. This is not, however, synonymous with addiction see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) . Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be lifethreatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. Do not initiate <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 13 to 12 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcgmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcgmL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcgmL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 gplate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 gmL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 gmL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mgkg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (23 weeks postcohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested (8 mgkgday).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlledrelease tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 13 to 12 the usual dosage in debilitated, nonopioidtolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. It is important to take the pharmacokinetic profile of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> into account when treating overdose. Even in the face of improvement, continued medical monitoring is required because of the possibility of extended effects as opioid continues to be absorbed from ingested tablets. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of whole <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets, and with abuse and misuse by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> overdosage, primary attention should be given to the maintenance of a patent airway, and of effective ventilation (clearance of CO2) and oxygenation, whether by spontaneous, assisted or controlled respiration. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Since the duration of action of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may exceed that of the antagonist, especially when the overdose involves intact tablets, keep the patient under continued surveillance and administer repeated doses of the antagonist according to the antagonist labeling as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Do not administer opioid antagonists in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, an abrupt partial or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence (or withdrawal) syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. See the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of its proper use.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics A singledose, doubleblind, placebo and dosecontrolled study was conducted using <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose see Overdosage (10) . Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Endocrine System Opioids may influence the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal or gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. Immune System In vitro and animal studies indicate that opioids have a variety of effects on immune functions, depending on the context in which they are used. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects. The dose of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> must be individualized see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dependence</i>:</td><td>9.3 Dependence Physical dependence to an opioid is manifested by characteristic withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug, significant dose reduction or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome in adults is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, piloerection, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate see Use In Specific Populations (8.2) . In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued see Dosage and Administration (2.9) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Must be swallowed whole (5.1) May cause somnolence, dizziness, alterations in judgment and alterations in levels of consciousness, including coma. (5.2) Additive CNS effects are expected when used with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.1, 5.3, 7.3) Use with caution in patients who are receiving other CNS depressants. (5.1, 5.3, 7.3) May cause respiratory depression. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression, elderly and debilitated patients (5.4) May aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. (5.5) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.6) Use with caution in patients at risk for ileus. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients. (5.6) May worsen increased intracranial pressure and obscure its signs, such as level of consciousness or pupillary signs. (5.7) May cause hypotension. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of hypotension and in patients in circulatory shock. (5.8) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects (5.9) Mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.10) Use with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. (5.11) Tolerance may develop. (5.12) Use with caution in alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. (5.13) May impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. (5.14) No approved use in the treatment of addiction. (5.15) Not every urine drug test for "opioids" or "opiates" detects oxycodone reliably. (5.16) 5.1 Information Essential for Safe Administration <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> 60 mg and 80 mg Tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in opioidtolerant patients . Use of these doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. 5.2 CNS Depression <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause somnolence, dizziness, alterations in judgment and alterations in levels of consciousness, including coma. 5.3 Interactions with Alcohol, CNS Depressants and Illicit Drugs Hypotension, profound sedation, coma or respiratory depression may result if <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is added to a regimen that includes other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). Therefore, use caution when deciding to initiate therapy with <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> in patients who are taking other CNS depressants. Take into account the types of other medications being taken, the duration of therapy with them, and the patients response to those medicines, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Consider the patients use, if any, of alcohol andor illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> is made, start with a lower <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> dose than usual see Drug Interactions (7.3) . Consider using a lower initial dose of a CNS depressant when given to a patient currently taking <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> due to the potential of additive CNS depressant effects. 5.4 Respiratory Depression Decreased respiratory drive resulting in respiratory depression is the chief hazard from the use or abuse of opioid agonists, including <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. The risk of opioidinduced respiratory depression is increased, for example, in elderly see Use In Specific Populations (8.5) or debilitated patients following large initial doses in any patient who is not tolerant to the respiratorydepressant or sedating effects of opioids or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that either depress respiratory drive or consciousness. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with extreme caution in patients with any of the following significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale other risk of substantially decreased respiratory reserve hypoxia hypercapnia preexisting respiratory depression Respiratory depression induced by opioids typically follows a pattern entailing first a shift in CO2 responsiveness of the CNS respiratory drive center, which results in a decrease in the urge to breathe, despite the presence of hypercapnia. The increase in brain CO2 can result in sedation that can accentuate the sedation from the opioid itself. Profound sedation, unresponsiveness, infrequent deep ("sighing") breaths or atypical snoring frequently accompany opioidinduced respiratory depression. Eventually, hypoxia ensues. In addition to further decreasing consciousness, hypoxia, along with hypercapnia, can predispose to lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5 Seizures Oxycodone, as with other opioids, may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorders. 5.6 Difficulty Swallowing and Gastrointestinal Effects There have been postmarketing reports of difficulty in swallowing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to presoak, lick or otherwise wet <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Use caution when prescribing <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> for patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. The administration of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in patients who are at risk of developing ileus. 5.7 Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention, which can lead to an elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. This effect may be exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone may produce miosis that is independent of ambient light, and altered consciousness, either of which may obscure neurologic signs associated with increased intracranial pressure in persons with head injuries. 5.8 Hypotensive Effect <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Administer <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.9 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. The expected clinical results with CYP3A4 inhibitors would be an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and possibly increased or prolonged opioid effects. The expected clinical results with CYP3A4 inducers would be a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . 5.10 Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics It is generally not advisable to administer mixed agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) to a patient receiving <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b>. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 5.11 Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.12 Tolerance Tolerance to opioids is demonstrated by the need for increasing doses to maintain adequate analgesic effect (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). If tolerance develops, or if pain severity increases, a gradual increase in dose may be required. The first sign of tolerance is usually a reduced duration of effect. Tolerance to different effects of opioids may develop to varying degrees and at varying rates in a given individual. There is also interpatient variability in the rate and extent of tolerance that develops to various opioid effects, whether the effect is desirable (e.g., analgesia) or undesirable (e.g., nausea). 5.13 Special Risk Groups Use <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> with caution in the following conditions, due to increased risk of adverse reactions alcoholism delirium tremens adrenocortical insufficiency CNS depression debilitation kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory compromise myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. 5.14 Driving and Operating Machinery <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients accordingly. 5.15 Use in Addiction Treatment <b style='color:red'>OxyContin</b> has no approved use in the treatment of addiction. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol addiction (substance dependence), either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. 5.16 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for "opioids" or "opiates" detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for inoffice use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified "cutoff" value as "negative". Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and use caution in interpreting results.</td></tr>
