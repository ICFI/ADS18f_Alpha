<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted with ziprasidone in Long Evans rats and CD1 mice. Ziprasidone was administered for 24 months in the diet at doses of 2, 6, or 12 mgkgday to rats, and 50, 100, or 200 mgkgday to mice (0.1 to 0.6 and 1 to 5 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis, respectively). In the rat study, there was no evidence of an increased incidence of tumors compared to controls. In male mice, there was no increase in incidence of tumors relative to controls. In female mice, there were doserelated increases in the incidences of pituitary gland adenoma and carcinoma, and mammary gland adenocarcinoma at all doses tested (50 to 200 mgkgday or 1 to 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). Proliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary glands of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered to be prolactinmediated. Increases in serum prolactin were observed in a 1month dietary study in female, but not male, mice at 100 and 200 mgkgday (or 2.5 and 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). Ziprasidone had no effect on serum prolactin in rats in a 5week dietary study at the doses that were used in the carcinogenicity study. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactinmediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.11). Mutagenesis Ziprasidone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation mouse lymphoma assay, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes, and the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in mouse bone marrow. There was a reproducible mutagenic response in the Ames assay in one strain of S. typhimurium in the absence of metabolic activation. Positive results were obtained in both the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation assay and the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Impairment of Fertility Ziprasidone was shown to increase time to copulation in SpragueDawley rats in two fertility and early embryonic development studies at doses of 10 to 160 mgkgday (0.5 to 8 times the MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis). Fertility rate was reduced at 160 mgkgday (8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). There was no effect on fertility at 40 mgkgday (2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). The effect on fertility appeared to be in the female since fertility was not impaired when males given 160 mgkgday (8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) were mated with untreated females. In a 6month study in male rats given 200 mgkgday (10 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) there were no treatmentrelated findings observed in the testes.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C In animal studies ziprasidone demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects at doses similar to human therapeutic doses. When ziprasidone was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, an increased incidence of fetal structural abnormalities (ventricular septal defects and other cardiovascular malformations and kidney alterations) was observed at a dose of 30 mgkgday (3 times the MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis). There was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 10 mgkgday (equivalent to the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). In rats, embryofetal toxicity (decreased fetal weights, delayed skeletal ossification) was observed following administration of 10 to 160 mgkgday (0.5 to 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) during organogenesis or throughout gestation, but there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Doses of 40 and 160 mgkgday (2 and 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) were associated with maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). There was an increase in the number of pups born dead and a decrease in postnatal survival through the first 4 days of lactation among the offspring of female rats treated during gestation and lactation with doses of 10 mgkgday (0.5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. Offspring developmental delays and neurobehavioral functional impairment were observed at doses of 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. A noeffect level was not established for these effects. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>"12.3 Pharmacokinetics Oral Pharmacokinetics Ziprasidones activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multipledose pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone are doseproportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and ziprasidone accumulation is predictable with multiple dosing. Elimination of ziprasidone is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal halflife of about 7 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steadystate concentrations are achieved within one to three days of dosing. The mean apparent systemic clearance is 7.5 mLminkg. Ziprasidone is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Absorption Ziprasidone is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 6 to 8 hours. The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose under fed conditions is approximately 60. The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to twofold in the presence of food. Distribution Ziprasidone has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 1.5 Lkg. It is greater than 99 bound to plasma proteins, binding primarily to albumin and 1acid glycoprotein. The in vitro plasma protein binding of ziprasidone was not altered by warfarin or propranolol, two highly proteinbound drugs, nor did ziprasidone alter the binding of these drugs in human plasma. Thus, the potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement is minimal. Metabolism and Elimination Ziprasidone is extensively metabolized after oral administration with only a small amount excreted in the urine (1) or feces (4) as unchanged drug. Ziprasidone is primarily cleared via three metabolic routes to yield four major circulating metabolites, benzisothiazole (BITP) sulphoxide, BITPsulphone, ziprasidone sulphoxide, and Smethyldihydroziprasidone. Approximately 20 of the dose is excreted in the urine, with approximately 66 being eliminated in the feces. Unchanged ziprasidone represents about 44 of total drugrelated material in serum. In vitro studies using human liver subcellular fractions indicate that Smethyldihydroziprasidone is generated in two steps. The data indicate that the reduction reaction is mediated by aldehyde oxidase and the subsequent methylation is mediated by thiol methyltransferase. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes indicate that CYP3A4 is the major CYP contributing to the oxidative metabolism of ziprasidone. CYP1A2 may contribute to a much lesser extent. Based on in vivo abundance of excretory metabolites, less than onethird of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is mediated by cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidation and approximately twothirds via reduction by aldehyde oxidase. There are no known clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of aldehyde oxidase."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugdrug interactions can be pharmacodynamic (combined pharmacologic effects) or pharmacokinetic (alteration of plasma levels). The risks of using ziprasidone in combination with other drugs have been evaluated as described below. All interactions studies have been conducted with oral ziprasidone. Based upon the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of ziprasidone, possible interactions could be anticipated Ziprasidone should not be used in combination with other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation (4.1, 7.3) The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to twofold in the presence of food (7.9) The full prescribing information contains additional drug interactions (7). 7.1 Metabolic Pathway Approximately twothirds of ziprasidone is metabolized via reduction by aldehyde oxidase. There are no known clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of aldehyde oxidase. Less than onethird of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is mediated by cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidation. 7.2 In Vitro Studies An in vitro enzyme inhibition study utilizing human liver microsomes showed that ziprasidone had little inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and thus would not likely interfere with the metabolism of drugs primarily metabolized by these enzymes. There is little potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 7.3 Pharmacodynamic Interactions Ziprasidone should not be used with any drug that prolongs the QT interval See Contraindications (4.1). Given the primary CNS effects of ziprasidone, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, ziprasidone may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Ziprasidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. 7.4 Pharmacokinetic Interactions  Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is an inducer of CYP3A4 administration of 200 mg twice daily for 21 days resulted in a decrease of approximately 35 in the AUC of ziprasidone. This effect may be greater when higher doses of carbamazepine are administered. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, at a dose of 400 mg QD for 5 days, increased the AUC and Cmax of ziprasidone by about 3540. Other inhibitors of CYP3A4 would be expected to have similar effects.  Cimetidine Cimetidine at a dose of 800 mg QD for 2 days did not affect ziprasidone pharmacokinetics.  Antacid The coadministration of 30 mL of Maalox with ziprasidone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. 7.5 Lithium Ziprasidone at a dose of 40 mg twice daily administered concomitantly with lithium at a dose of 450 mg twice daily for 7 days did not affect the steadystate level or renal clearance of lithium. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In vivo studies have revealed no effect of ziprasidone on the pharmacokinetics of estrogen or progesterone components. Ziprasidone at a dose of 20 mg twice daily did not affect the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered oral contraceptives, ethinyl estradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg). 7.7 Dextromethorphan Consistent with in vitro results, a study in normal healthy volunteers showed that ziprasidone did not alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 model substrate, to its major metabolite, dextrorphan. There was no statistically significant change in the urinary dextromethorphandextrorphan ratio. 7.8 Valproate A pharmacokinetic interaction of ziprasidone with valproate is unlikely due to the lack of common metabolic pathways for the two drugs. 7.9 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy Population pharmacokinetic analysis of schizophrenic patients enrolled in controlled clinical trials has not revealed evidence of any clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with benztropine, propranolol, or lorazepam. 7.10 Food Interaction The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose under fed conditions is approximately 60. The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to twofold in the presence of food see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence 5 and at least twice the incidence for placebo) were  Schizophrenia Somnolence, respiratory tract infection (6.1)  Manic and Mixed Episodes Associated with Bipolar Disorder Somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, dizziness, akathisia, abnormal vision, asthenia, vomiting (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact 18004381985 or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical trials for oral ziprasidone included approximately 5700 patients andor normal subjects exposed to one or more doses of ziprasidone. Of these 5700, over 4800 were patients who participated in multipledose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 1831 patientyears. These patients include (1) 4331 patients who participated in multipledose trials, predominantly in schizophrenia, representing approximately 1698 patientyears of exposure as of February 5, 2000. The conditions and duration of treatment with ziprasidone included openlabel and doubleblind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and shortterm and longerterm exposure. Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by collecting voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials with Oral Ziprasidone The following findings are based on the shortterm placebocontrolled premarketing trials for schizophrenia (a pool of two 6week, and two 4week fixeddose trials) in which ziprasidone was administered in doses ranging from 10 to 200 mgday. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short TermPlaceboControlled Trials The following adverse reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of ziprasidone (incidence of 5 or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebotreated patients (ziprasidone incidence at least twice that for placebo) Schizophrenia trials (see Table 1) Somnolence Respiratory Tract Infection SCHIZOPHRENIA Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials of Oral Ziprasidone Approximately 4.1 (29702) of ziprasidonetreated patients in shortterm, placebocontrolled studies discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with about 2.2 (6273) on placebo. The most common reaction associated with dropout was rash, including 7 dropouts for rash among ziprasidone patients (1) compared to no placebo patients See Warnings and Precautions (5.6). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2 or More Among ZiprasidoneTreated Patients in ShortTerm, Oral, PlaceboControlled Trials Table 1 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks) in predominantly patients with schizophrenia, including only those reactions that occurred in 2 or more of patients treated with ziprasidone and for which the incidence in patients treated with ziprasidone was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients.

None of these adverse reactions occured individually at an incidence greater than 5 in schizophrenia trials.  Dizziness includes the adverse reaction terms dizziness and lightheadedness. Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, FixedDose, PlaceboControlled Trials An analysis for dose response in the schizophrenia 4study pool revealed an apparent relation of adverse reaction to dose for the following reactions asthenia, postural hypotension, anorexia, dry mouth, increased salivation, arthralgia, anxiety, dizziness, dystonia, hypertonia, somnolence, tremor, rhinitis, rash, and abnormal vision. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)  The incidence of reported EPS (which included the adverse reaction terms extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, dystonia, dyskinesia, hypokinesia, tremor, paralysis and twitching) for ziprasidonetreated patients in the shortterm, placebocontrolled schizophrenia trials was 14 vs. 8 for placebo. Objectively collected data from those trials on the SimpsonAngus Rating Scale (for EPS) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia) did not generally show a difference between ziprasidone and placebo. Dystonia  Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Vital Sign Changes  Ziprasidone is associated with orthostatic hypotension see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) Weight Gain  The proportions of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7 of body weight were compared in a pool of four 4 and 6week placebocontrolled schizophrenia clinical trials, revealing a statistically significantly greater incidence of weight gain for ziprasidone (10) compared to placebo (4). A median weight gain of 0.5 kg was observed in ziprasidone patients compared to no median weight change in placebo patients. In this set of clinical trials, weight gain was reported as an adverse reaction in 0.4 and 0.4 of ziprasidone and placebo patients, respectively. During longterm therapy with ziprasidone, a categorization of patients at baseline on the basis of body mass index (BMI) revealed the greatest mean weight gain and highest incidence of clinically significant weight gain (7 of body weight) in patients with low BMI (23) compared to normal (2327) or <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> patients (27). There was a mean weight gain of 1.4 kg for those patients with a "low" baseline BMI, no mean change for patients with a "normal" BMI, and a 1.3 kg mean weight loss for patients who entered the program with a "high" BMI. ECG Changes  Ziprasidone is associated with an increase in the QTc interval see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). In the schizophrenia trials, ziprasidone was associated with a mean increase in heart rate of 1.4 beats per minute compared to a 0.2 beats per minute decrease among placebo patients. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Oral Ziprasidone Following is a list of COSTART terms that reflect treatmentemergent adverse reactions as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section reported by patients treated with ziprasidone in schizophrenia trials at multiple doses 4 mgday within the database of 3834 patients. All reported reactions are included except those already listed in Table 1 or elsewhere in labeling, those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative, reactions reported only once and that did not have a substantial probability of being acutely lifethreatening, reactions that are part of the illness being treated or are otherwise common as background reactions, and reactions considered unlikely to be drugrelated. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with ziprasidone, they were not necessarily caused by it.

It is not meant to take the place of your doctors instructions. Read this information carefully before you take ziprasidone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand any of this information or if you want to know more about ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules. What Is ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules? Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are a type of prescription medicine called a psychotropic, also known as an atypical antipsychotic. Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules can be used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia. Who Should Take ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules? Only your doctor can know if ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are right for you. ziprasidone may be prescribed for you if you have schizophrenia. Symptoms of schizophrenia may include hearing voices, seeing things, or sensing things that are not there (hallucinations) beliefs that are not true (delusions) unusual suspiciousness (paranoia) becoming withdrawn from family and friends If you show a response to ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules, your symptoms may improve. If you continue to take ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules there is less chance of your symptoms returning. Do not stop taking the capsules even when you feel better without first discussing it with your doctor. It is also important to remember that ziprasidone capsules should be taken with food. What is the most important safety information I should know about ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules? Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis. Elderly patients with a diagnosis of psychosis related to dementia treated with antipsychotics are at an increased risk of death when compared to patients who are treated with placebo (a sugar pill). Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are an effective drug to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and the manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. However, one potential side effect is that it may change the way the electrical current in your heart works more than some other drugs. The change is small and it is not known whether this will be harmful, but some other drugs that cause this kind of change have in rare cases caused dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities. Because of this, ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules should be used only after your doctor has considered this risk for ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules against the risks and benefits of other medications available for treating schizophrenia. Your risk of dangerous changes in heart rhythm can be increased if you are taking certain other medicines and if you already have certain abnormal heart conditions. Therefore, it is important to tell your doctor about any other medicines that you take, including nonprescription medicines, supplements, and herbal medicines. You must also tell your doctor about any heart problems you have or have had. Who should NOT take ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules? Elderly patients with a diagnosis of psychosis related to dementia. Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are not approved for the treatment of these patients. Anything that can increase the chance of a heart rhythm abnormality should be avoided. Therefore, do not take ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules if You have certain heart diseases, for example, long QT syndrome, a recent heart attack, severe heart failure, or certain irregularities of heart rhythm (discuss the specifics with your doctor) You are currently taking medications that should not be taken in combination with ziprasidone, for example, dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, other Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, droperidol, pimozide, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine, arsenic trioxide, levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus.

What To Do For An Overdose In case of an overdose, call your doctor or poison control center right away or go to the nearest emergency room. Other Important Safety Information A serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) can occur with all antipsychotic medications including ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules. Signs of NMS include very high fever, rigid muscles, shaking, confusion, sweating, or increased heart rate and blood pressure. NMS is a rare but serious side effect that could be fatal. Therefore, tell your doctor if you experience any of these signs. Adverse reactions related to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), sometimes serious, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules, and it is not known if ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are associated with these reactions. Patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia. Dizziness caused by a drop in your blood pressure may occur with ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules, especially when you first start taking this medication or when the dose is increased. If this happens, be careful not to stand up too quickly, and talk to your doctor about the problem. Before taking ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules, tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant. It is advised that you dont breast feed an infant if you are taking ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules. Because ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules can cause sleepiness, be careful when operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Since medications of the same drug class as ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules may interfere with the ability of the body to adjust to heat, it is best to avoid situations involving high temperature or humidity. It is best to avoid consuming alcoholic beverages while taking ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Give oral doses with food. Schizophrenia Initiate at 20 mg twice daily. Daily dosage may be adjusted up to 80 mg twice daily. Dose adjustments should occur at intervals of not less than 2 days. Safety and efficacy has been demonstrated in doses up to 100 mg twice daily. The lowest effective dose should be used. (2.1) Acute treatment of manicmixed episodes of bipolar I disorder Initiate at 40 mg twice daily. Increase to 60 mg or 80 mg twice daily on day 2 of treatment. Subsequent dose adjustments should be based on tolerability and efficacy within the range of 4080 mg twice daily. (2.2) Maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as an adjunct to lithium or valproate Continue treatment at the same dose on which the patient was initially stabilized, within the range of 4080 mg twice daily. (2.2) 2.1 Schizophrenia Dose Selection Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules should be administered at an initial daily dose of 20 mg twice daily with food. In some patients, daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status up to 80 mg twice daily. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 2 days, as steadystate is achieved within 1 to 3 days. In order to ensure use of the lowest effective dose, patients should ordinarily be observed for improvement for several weeks before upward dosage adjustment. Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 20 mg to 100 mg twice daily in shortterm, placebocontrolled clinical trials. There were trends toward dose response within the range of 20 mg to 80 mg twice daily, but results were not consistent. An increase to a dose greater than 80 mg twice daily is not generally recommended. The safety of doses above 100 mg twice daily has not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.1). Maintenance Treatment While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient treated with ziprasidone should remain on it, a maintenance study in patients who had been symptomatically stable and then randomized to continue ziprasidone or switch to placebo demonstrated a delay in time to relapse for patients receiving ziprasidone hydrochloride. see Clinical Studies (14.1). No additional benefit was demonstrated for doses above 20 mg twice daily. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. 2.3 Dosing in Special Populations Oral Dosage adjustments are generally not required on the basis of age, gender, race, or renal or hepatic impairment. Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are not approved for use in children or adolescents.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ziprasidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drugs efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ziprasidone exhibited high in vitro binding affinity for the dopamine D2 and D3, the serotonin 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT1A, 5HT1D, and 1adrenergic receptors (Ki s of 4.8, 7.2, 0.4, 1.3, 3.4, 2, and 10 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the histamine H1 receptor (Ki47 nM). Ziprasidone functioned as an antagonist at the D2, 5HT2A, and 5HT1D receptors, and as an agonist at the 5HT1A receptor. Ziprasidone inhibited synaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. No appreciable affinity was exhibited for other receptorbinding sites tested, including the cholinergic muscarinic receptor (IC50 1 M). Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of ziprasidone. Ziprasidones antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Ziprasidones antagonism of 1adrenergic receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Oral Pharmacokinetics Ziprasidones activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multipledose pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone are doseproportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and ziprasidone accumulation is predictable with multiple dosing. Elimination of ziprasidone is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal halflife of about 7 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steadystate concentrations are achieved within one to three days of dosing. The mean apparent systemic clearance is 7.5 mLminkg. Ziprasidone is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Absorption Ziprasidone is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 6 to 8 hours. The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose under fed conditions is approximately 60. The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to twofold in the presence of food. Distribution Ziprasidone has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 1.5 Lkg. It is greater than 99 bound to plasma proteins, binding primarily to albumin and 1acid glycoprotein. The in vitro plasma protein binding of ziprasidone was not altered by warfarin or propranolol, two highly proteinbound drugs, nor did ziprasidone alter the binding of these drugs in human plasma. Thus, the potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement is minimal. Metabolism and Elimination Ziprasidone is extensively metabolized after oral administration with only a small amount excreted in the urine (1) or feces (4) as unchanged drug. Ziprasidone is primarily cleared via three metabolic routes to yield four major circulating metabolites, benzisothiazole (BITP) sulphoxide, BITPsulphone, ziprasidone sulphoxide, and Smethyldihydroziprasidone. Approximately 20 of the dose is excreted in the urine, with approximately 66 being eliminated in the feces. Unchanged ziprasidone represents about 44 of total drugrelated material in serum. In vitro studies using human liver subcellular fractions indicate that Smethyldihydroziprasidone is generated in two steps. The data indicate that the reduction reaction is mediated by aldehyde oxidase and the subsequent methylation is mediated by thiol methyltransferase. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes indicate that CYP3A4 is the major CYP contributing to the oxidative metabolism of ziprasidone. CYP1A2 may contribute to a much lesser extent. Based on in vivo abundance of excretory metabolites, less than onethird of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is mediated by cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidation and approximately twothirds via reduction by aldehyde oxidase. There are no known clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of aldehyde oxidase."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Schizophrenia The efficacy of oral ziprasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in 5 placebocontrolled studies, 4 shortterm (4 and 6week) trials and one maintenance trial. All trials were in adult inpatients, most of whom met DSM IIIR criteria for schizophrenia. Each study included 2 to 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone as well as placebo. Four of the 5 trials were able to distinguish ziprasidone from placebo one shortterm study did not. Although a single fixeddose haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in one of the three shortterm trials, this single study was inadequate to provide a reliable and valid comparison of ziprasidone and haloperidol. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) are both multiitem inventories of general psychopathology usually used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second widely used assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, the Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS) was employed for assessing negative symptoms in one trial. The results of the oral ziprasidone trials in schizophrenia follow In a 4week, placebocontrolled trial (n139) comparing 2 fixed doses of ziprasidone (20 and 60 mg twice daily) with placebo, only the 60 mg dose was superior to placebo on the BPRS total score and the CGI severity score. This higher dose group was not superior to placebo on the BPRS psychosis cluster or on the SANS. In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n302) comparing 2 fixed doses of ziprasidone (40 and 80 mg twice daily) with placebo, both dose groups were superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, the CGI severity score and the PANSS total and negative subscale scores. Although 80 mg twice daily had a numerically greater effect than 40 mg twice daily, the difference was not statistically significant. In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n419) comparing 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone (20, 60, and 100 mg twice daily) with placebo, all three dose groups were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score, the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. Only the 100 mg twice daily dose group was superior to placebo on the PANSS negative subscale score. There was no clear evidence for a doseresponse relationship within the 20 mg twice daily to 100 mg twice daily dose range. In a 4week, placebocontrolled trial (n200) comparing 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone (5, 20, and 40 mg twice daily), none of the dose groups was statistically superior to placebo on any outcome of interest. A study was conducted in stable chronic or subchronic (CGIS 5 at baseline) schizophrenic inpatients (n294) who had been hospitalized for not less than two months. After a 3day singleblind placebo runin, subjects were randomized to one of 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone (20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg twice daily) or placebo and observed for relapse. Patients were observed for "impending psychotic relapse," defined as CGIimprovement score of 6 (much worse or very much worse) andor scores 6 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS on two consecutive days. Ziprasidone was significantly superior to placebo in time to relapse, with no significant difference between the different dose groups. There were insufficient data to examine population subsets based on age and race. Examination of population subsets based on gender did not reveal any differential responsiveness.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  Pregnancy Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk (8.1).  Nursing Mothers Breast feeding is not recommended (8.3)  Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness for pediatric patients has not been established (8.4) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C In animal studies ziprasidone demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects at doses similar to human therapeutic doses. When ziprasidone was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, an increased incidence of fetal structural abnormalities (ventricular septal defects and other cardiovascular malformations and kidney alterations) was observed at a dose of 30 mgkgday (3 times the MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis). There was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 10 mgkgday (equivalent to the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). In rats, embryofetal toxicity (decreased fetal weights, delayed skeletal ossification) was observed following administration of 10 to 160 mgkgday (0.5 to 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) during organogenesis or throughout gestation, but there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Doses of 40 and 160 mgkgday (2 and 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) were associated with maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). There was an increase in the number of pups born dead and a decrease in postnatal survival through the first 4 days of lactation among the offspring of female rats treated during gestation and lactation with doses of 10 mgkgday (0.5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. Offspring developmental delays and neurobehavioral functional impairment were observed at doses of 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. A noeffect level was not established for these effects. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of ziprasidone on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether ziprasidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. It is recommended that women receiving ziprasidone should not breastfeed. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ziprasidone in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ziprasidone, 2.4 percent were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the presence of multiple factors that might increase the pharmacodynamic response to ziprasidone, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period for some elderly patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Because ziprasidone is highly metabolized, with less than 1 of the drug excreted unchanged, renal impairment alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. The pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone following 8 days of 20 mg twice daily dosing were similar among subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (n27), and subjects with normal renal function, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. Ziprasidone is not removed by hemodialysis. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment As ziprasidone is cleared substantially by the liver, the presence of hepatic impairment would be expected to increase the AUC of ziprasidone a multipledose study at 20 mg twice daily for 5 days in subjects (n13) with clinically significant (ChildsPugh Class A and B) cirrhosis revealed an increase in AUC 012 of 13 and 34 in ChildsPugh Class A and B, respectively, compared to a matched control group (n14). A halflife of 7.1 hours was observed in subjects with cirrhosis compared to 4.8 hours in the control group. 8.8 Age and Gender Effects In a multipledose (8 days of treatment) study involving 32 subjects, there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone between men and women or between elderly (65 years) and young (18 to 45 years) subjects. Additionally, population pharmacokinetic evaluation of patients in controlled trials has revealed no evidence of clinically significant age or genderrelated differences in the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Dosage modifications for age or gender are, therefore, not recommended. 8.9 Smoking Based on in vitro studies utilizing human liver enzymes, ziprasidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2 smoking should therefore not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Consistent with these in vitro results, population pharmacokinetic evaluation has not revealed any significant pharmacokinetic differences between smokers and nonsmokers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted with ziprasidone in Long Evans rats and CD1 mice. Ziprasidone was administered for 24 months in the diet at doses of 2, 6, or 12 mgkgday to rats, and 50, 100, or 200 mgkgday to mice (0.1 to 0.6 and 1 to 5 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis, respectively). In the rat study, there was no evidence of an increased incidence of tumors compared to controls. In male mice, there was no increase in incidence of tumors relative to controls. In female mice, there were doserelated increases in the incidences of pituitary gland adenoma and carcinoma, and mammary gland adenocarcinoma at all doses tested (50 to 200 mgkgday or 1 to 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). Proliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary glands of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered to be prolactinmediated. Increases in serum prolactin were observed in a 1month dietary study in female, but not male, mice at 100 and 200 mgkgday (or 2.5 and 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). Ziprasidone had no effect on serum prolactin in rats in a 5week dietary study at the doses that were used in the carcinogenicity study. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactinmediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.11). Mutagenesis Ziprasidone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation mouse lymphoma assay, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes, and the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in mouse bone marrow. There was a reproducible mutagenic response in the Ames assay in one strain of S. typhimurium in the absence of metabolic activation. Positive results were obtained in both the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation assay and the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Impairment of Fertility Ziprasidone was shown to increase time to copulation in SpragueDawley rats in two fertility and early embryonic development studies at doses of 10 to 160 mgkgday (0.5 to 8 times the MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis). Fertility rate was reduced at 160 mgkgday (8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). There was no effect on fertility at 40 mgkgday (2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). The effect on fertility appeared to be in the female since fertility was not impaired when males given 160 mgkgday (8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) were mated with untreated females. In a 6month study in male rats given 200 mgkgday (10 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) there were no treatmentrelated findings observed in the testes.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ziprasidone, 2.4 percent were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the presence of multiple factors that might increase the pharmacodynamic response to ziprasidone, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period for some elderly patients.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience In premarketing trials involving more than 5400 patients andor normal subjects, accidental or intentional overdosage of oral ziprasidone was documented in 10 patients. All of these patients survived without sequelae. In the patient taking the largest confirmed amount, 3,240 mg, the only symptoms reported were minimal sedation, slurring of speech, and transitory hypertension (20095). Adverse reactions reported with ziprasidone overdose included extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, tremor, and anxiety. see Adverse Reactions (6.2) 10.2 Management of Overdosage In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Intravenous access should be established, and gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QTprolonging effects that might be additive to those of ziprasidone. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids. If sympathomimetic agents are used for vascular support, epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation combined with 1 antagonism associated with ziprasidone may worsen hypotension. Similarly, it is reasonable to expect that the alphaadrenergicblocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of ziprasidone, resulting in problematic hypotension. In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. There is no specific antidote to ziprasidone, and it is not dialyzable. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>"12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ziprasidone exhibited high in vitro binding affinity for the dopamine D2 and D3, the serotonin 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT1A, 5HT1D, and 1adrenergic receptors (Ki s of 4.8, 7.2, 0.4, 1.3, 3.4, 2, and 10 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the histamine H1 receptor (Ki47 nM). Ziprasidone functioned as an antagonist at the D2, 5HT2A, and 5HT1D receptors, and as an agonist at the 5HT1A receptor. Ziprasidone inhibited synaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. No appreciable affinity was exhibited for other receptorbinding sites tested, including the cholinergic muscarinic receptor (IC50 1 M). Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of ziprasidone. Ziprasidones antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Ziprasidones antagonism of 1adrenergic receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dependence</i>:</td><td>9.3 Dependence Ziprasidone has not been systematically studied, in animals or humans, for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which ziprasidone will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of ziprasidone misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  QT Interval Prolongation Ziprasidone use should be avoided in patients with bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, congenital prolongation of the QT interval, or in combination with other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation (5.2)  Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Potentially fatal symptom complex has been reported with antipsychotic drugs. Manage with immediate discontinuation of drug and close monitoring. (5.3)  Tardive Dyskinesia May develop acutely or chronically (5.4)  Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. When starting treatment, patients with DM risk factors should undergo blood glucose testing before and during treatment (5.5)  Rash Discontinue in patients who develop a rash without an identified cause (5.6)  Orthostatic Hypotension Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease (5.7)  Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis has been reported with antipsychotics. Patients with a preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) or a history of leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue ziprasidone at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.(5.8)  Seizures Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower seizure threshold (5.9)  Potential for Cognitive and Motor impairment Patients should use caution when operating machinery (5.12)  Suicide Closely supervise highrisk patients (5.15) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Ziprasidone is not approved for the treatment of dementiarelated psychosis. see Boxed Warning 5.2 QT Prolongation and Risk of Sudden Death Ziprasidone use should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval see Contraindications (4.1), Drug Interactions (7.4). Additionally, clinicians should be alert to the identification of other drugs that have been consistently observed to prolong the QTc interval. Such drugs should not be prescribed with ziprasidone. Ziprasidone should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias see Contraindications (4). A study directly comparing the QTQTc prolonging effect of oral ziprasidone with several other drugs effective in the treatment of schizophrenia was conducted in patient volunteers. In the first phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration when the drug was administered alone. In the second phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration while the drug was coadministered with an inhibitor of the CYP4503A4 metabolism of the drug. In the first phase of the study, the mean change in QTc from baseline was calculated for each drug, using a samplebased correction that removes the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for ziprasidone ranged from approximately 9 to 14 msec greater than for four of the comparator drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol), but was approximately 14 msec less than the prolongation observed for thioridazine. In the second phase of the study, the effect of ziprasidone on QTc length was not augmented by the presence of a metabolic inhibitor (ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily). In placebocontrolled trials, oral ziprasidone increased the QTc interval compared to placebo by approximately 10 msec at the highest recommended daily dose of 160 mg. In clinical trials with oral ziprasidone, the electrocardiograms of 22988 (0.06) patients who received ziprasidone and 1440 (0.23) patients who received placebo revealed QTc intervals exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. In the ziprasidonetreated patients, neither case suggested a role of ziprasidone. One patient had a history of prolonged QTc and a screening measurement of 489 msec QTc was 503 msec during ziprasidone treatment. The other patient had a QTc of 391 msec at the end of treatment with ziprasidone and upon switching to thioridazine experienced QTc measurements of 518 and 593 msec. Some drugs that prolong the QTQTc interval have been associated with the occurrence of torsade de pointes and with sudden unexplained death. The relationship of QT prolongation to torsade de pointes is clearest for larger increases (20 msec and greater) but it is possible that smaller QTQTc prolongations may also increase risk, or increase it in susceptible individuals. Although torsade de pointes has not been observed in association with the use of ziprasidone in premarketing studies and experience is too limited to rule out an increased risk, there have been rare postmarketing reports (in the presence of multiple confounding factors) see Adverse Reactions (6.2). As with other antipsychotic drugs and placebo, sudden unexplained deaths have been reported in patients taking ziprasidone at recommended doses. The premarketing experience for ziprasidone did not reveal an excess risk of mortality for ziprasidone compared to other antipsychotic drugs or placebo, but the extent of exposure was limited, especially for the drugs used as active controls and placebo. Nevertheless, ziprasidones larger prolongation of QTc length compared to several other antipsychotic drugs raises the possibility that the risk of sudden death may be greater for ziprasidone than for other available drugs for treating schizophrenia. This possibility needs to be considered in deciding among alternative drug products see Indications and Usage (1). Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes andor sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. It is recommended that patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment who are at risk for significant electrolyte disturbances, hypokalemia in particular, have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Hypokalemia (andor hypomagnesemia) may increase the risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmia. Hypokalemia may result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Patients with low serum potassium andor magnesium should be repleted with those electrolytes before proceeding with treatment. It is essential to periodically monitor serum electrolytes in patients for whom diuretic therapy is introduced during ziprasidone treatment. Persistently prolonged QTc intervals may also increase the risk of further prolongation and arrhythmia, but it is not clear that routine screening ECG measures are effective in detecting such patients. Rather, ziprasidone should be avoided in patients with histories of significant cardiovascular illness, e.g., QT prolongation, recent acute myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia. Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements 500 msec. For patients taking ziprasidone who experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes, e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope, the prescriber should initiate further evaluation, e.g., Holter monitoring may be useful. 5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. 5.4 Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients undergoing treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, ziprasidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ziprasidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ziprasidone despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.5 Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with ziprasidone. Although fewer patients have been treated with ziprasidone, it is not known if this more limited experience is the sole reason for the paucity of such reports. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies, which did not include ziprasidone, suggest an increased risk of treatmentemergent hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics included in these studies. Because ziprasidone was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if ziprasidone is associated with this increased risk. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. 5.6 Rash In premarketing trials with ziprasidone, about 5 of patients developed rash andor urticaria, with discontinuation of treatment in about onesixth of these cases. The occurrence of rash was related to dose of ziprasidone, although the finding might also be explained by the longer exposure time in the higher dose patients. Several patients with rash had signs and symptoms of associated systemic illness, e.g., elevated WBCs. Most patients improved promptly with adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids andor upon discontinuation of ziprasidone, and all patients experiencing these reactions were reported to recover completely. Upon appearance of rash for which an alternative etiology cannot be identified, ziprasidone should be discontinued. 5.7 Orthostatic Hypotension Ziprasidone may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its 1adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 0.6 of the patients treated with ziprasidone. Ziprasidone should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). 5.8 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue ziprasidone at the first sign of decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm3) should discontinue ziprasidone and have their WBC followed until recovery. 5.9 Seizures During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.4 of patients treated with ziprasidone. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. As with other antipsychotic drugs, ziprasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimers dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.10 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimers dementia. Ziprasidone and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia see Boxed Warning. 5.11 Hyperprolactinemia As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, ziprasidone elevates prolactin levels in humans. Increased prolactin levels were also observed in animal studies with this compound, and were associated with an increase in mammary gland neoplasia in mice a similar effect was not observed in rats see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactindependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactinelevating compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. 5.12 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction in patients treated with ziprasidone. In the 4 and 6week placebocontrolled trials, somnolence was reported in 14 of patients on ziprasidone compared to 7 of placebo patients. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.3 of patients in shortterm clinical trials. Since ziprasidone has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that ziprasidone therapy does not affect them adversely. 5.13 Priapism One case of priapism was reported in the premarketing database. While the relationship of the reaction to ziprasidone use has not been established, other drugs with alphaadrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism, and it is possible that ziprasidone may share this capacity. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention. 5.14 Body Temperature Regulation Although not reported with ziprasidone in premarketing trials, disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ziprasidone for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration. 5.15 Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illness or bipolar disorder, and close supervision of highrisk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for ziprasidone should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose. 5.16 Patients with concomitant illnesses Clinical experience with ziprasidone in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited see Use in Specific Populations (8.6),( 8.7) Ziprasidone has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Because of the risk of QTc prolongation and orthostatic hypotension with ziprasidone, caution should be observed in cardiac patients see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), (5.7) 5.17 Laboratory Tests Patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment that are at risk of significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Low serum potassium and magnesium should be replaced before proceeding with treatment. Patients who are started on diuretics during ziprasidone therapy need periodic monitoring of serum potassium and magnesium. Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements 500 msec. see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)"</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category C In animal studies ziprasidone demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects at doses similar to human therapeutic doses. When ziprasidone was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, an increased incidence of fetal structural abnormalities (ventricular septal defects and other cardiovascular malformations and kidney alterations) was observed at a dose of 30 mgkgday (3 times the MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis). There was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 10 mgkgday (equivalent to the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). In rats, embryofetal toxicity (decreased fetal weights, delayed skeletal ossification) was observed following administration of 10 to 160 mgkgday (0.5 to 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) during organogenesis or throughout gestation, but there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Doses of 40 and 160 mgkgday (2 and 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) were associated with maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). There was an increase in the number of pups born dead and a decrease in postnatal survival through the first 4 days of lactation among the offspring of female rats treated during gestation and lactation with doses of 10 mgkgday (0.5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. Offspring developmental delays and neurobehavioral functional impairment were observed at doses of 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. A noeffect level was not established for these effects. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</td></tr>

Save this leaflet for future reference.) What are MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg? MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg contain 150 mg of ranitidine (as ranitidine hydrochloride, 168 mg), a medicine that doctors have prescribed more than 200 million times worldwide. What symptoms do MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg treat and prevent? MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg relieve and prevent heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach. Certain foods or beverages, and even lying down to sleep, can cause heartburn associated with acid indigestion or sour stomach. It is normal for the stomach to produce acid, especially after consuming food or beverages. However, acid in the wrong place, such as the esophagus, or too much acid, can cause burning pain and discomfort. Excellent safety Record The ingredient in MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg, ranitidine, has been prescribed by doctors for years to treat millions of patients safely and effectively. The active ingredient in MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg has been taken safely with many frequently prescribed medications. MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg are sugar free. How should I take MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg? To relieve symptoms, swallow 1 tablet with a glass of water. To prevent symptoms, swallow 1 tablet with a glass of water 30 to 60 minutes before eating food or drinking beverages that cause heartburn. This medicine can be used up to twice daily (do not take more than 2 tablets in 24 hours). MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg should not be given to children under 12 years old unless directed by a doctor. How do MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg work? MAXIMUM STRENGTH Ranitidine Tablets 150 mg reduce the production of stomach acid.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 isozymes in the range of observed efavirenz plasma concentrations. Coadministration of efavirenz with drugs primarily metabolized by these isozymes may result in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug. Therefore, appropriate dose adjustments may be necessary for these drugs. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity (e.g., phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin) would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations See Dosage and Administration (2). Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of ATRIPLA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, andor other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. Coadministration of tenofovir DF and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosineassociated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosineassociated adverse reactions for didanosine dosing adjustment recommendations, see Table 4. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. Lopinavirritonavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving lopinavirritonavir with ATRIPLA should be monitored for tenofovirassociated adverse reactions. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovirassociated adverse reactions See Table 4. Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended since coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF has been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of atazanavir. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavirritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA See Table 4. Other important drug interaction information for ATRIPLA is summarized in Table 1 and Table 4. The drug interactions described are based on trials conducted with efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir DF as individual agents or are potential drug interactions no drug interaction trials have been conducted using ATRIPLA for pharmacokinetics data see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Tables 59. The tables include potentially significant interactions, but are not all inclusive. Table 4 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class Drug Name Effect Clinical Comment Antiretroviral agents Protease inhibitor atazanavir atazanavir concentration  tenofovir concentration Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF decreases plasma concentrations of atazanavir. The combined effect of efavirenz plus tenofovir DF on atazanavir plasma concentrations is not known. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavirritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA. Protease inhibitor fosamprenavir calcium  amprenavir concentration Fosamprenavir (unboosted) Appropriate doses of fosamprenavir and ATRIPLA with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Fosamprenavirritonavir An additional 100 mgday (300 mg total) of ritonavir is recommended when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavirritonavir once daily. No change in the ritonavir dose is required when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir plus ritonavir twice daily. Protease inhibitor indinavir  indinavir concentration The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. Protease inhibitor lopinavirritonavir  lopinavir concentration  tenofovir concentration A dose increase of lopinavirritonavir to 600150 mg (3 tablets) twice daily may be considered when used in combination with efavirenz in treatmentexperienced patients where decreased susceptibility to lopinavir is clinically suspected (by treatment history or laboratory evidence). Patients should be monitored for tenofovirassociated adverse reactions. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovirassociated adverse reactions. Protease inhibitor ritonavir  ritonavir concentration  efavirenz concentration When ritonavir 500 mg every 12 hours was coadministered with efavirenz 600 mg once daily, the combination was associated with a higher frequency of adverse clinical experiences (e.g., dizziness, nausea, paresthesia) and laboratory abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes). Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when ATRIPLA is used in combination with ritonavir. Protease inhibitor saquinavir  saquinavir concentration Should not be used as sole protease inhibitor in combination with ATRIPLA. CCR5 coreceptor antagonist maraviroc  maraviroc concentration Efavirenz decreases plasma concentrations of maraviroc. Refer to the full prescribing information for maraviroc for guidance on coadministration with ATRIPLA. NRTI didanosine  didanosine concentration Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosineassociated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis and neuropathy. In patients weighing 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg if coadministered with ATRIPLA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for patients weighing 60 kg. Coadministration of ATRIPLA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosineassociated adverse reactions. For additional information, please consult the Videx  Videx EC (didanosine) prescribing information. Other agents Anticoagulant warfarin  or  warfarin concentration Plasma concentrations and effects potentially increased or decreased by efavirenz. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine  carbamazepine concentration  efavirenz concentration There are insufficient data to make a dose recommendation for ATRIPLA. Alternative anticonvulsant treatment should be used. phenytoin phenobarbital  anticonvulsant concentration  efavirenz concentration Potential for reduction in anticonvulsant andor efavirenz plasma levels periodic monitoring of anticonvulsant plasma levels should be conducted. Antidepressants bupropion  buproprion concentration The effect of efavirenz on bupropion exposure is thought to be due to the induction of bupropion metabolism. Increases in bupropion dosage should be guided by clinical response, but the maximum recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. sertraline  sertraline concentration Increases in sertraline dose should be guided by clinical response. Antifungals itraconazole  itraconazole concentration  hydroxyitraconazole concentration Since no dose recommendation for itraconazole can be made, alternative antifungal treatment should be considered. ketoconazole  ketoconazole concentration Drug interaction trials with ATRIPLA and ketoconazole have not been conducted. Efavirenz has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of ketoconazole. posaconazole  posaconazole concentration Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit outweighs the risks. Antiinfective clarithromycin  clarithromycin concentration  14OH metabolite concentration Clinical significance unknown. In uninfected volunteers, 46 developed rash while receiving efavirenz and clarithromycin. No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is recommended when given with clarithromycin. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Other macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, have not been studied in combination with ATRIPLA. Antimycobacterial rifabutin  rifabutin concentration Increase daily dose of rifabutin by 50. Consider doubling the rifabutin dose in regimens where rifabutin is given 2 or 3 times a week. Antimycobacterial rifampin  efavirenz concentration If ATRIPLA is coadministered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mgday of efavirenz is recommended. Calcium channel blockers diltiazem  diltiazem concentration  desacetyl diltiazem concentration  Nmonodesmethyl diltiazem concentration Diltiazem dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for diltiazem). No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is necessary when administered with diltiazem. Others (e.g., felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil)  calcium channel blocker No data are available on the potential interactions of efavirenz with other calcium channel blockers that are substrates of CYP3A. The potential exists for reduction in plasma concentrations of the calcium channel blocker. Dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for the calcium channel blocker). HMGCoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin pravastatin simvastatin  atorvastatin concentration  pravastatin concentration  simvastatin concentration Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin decreased with efavirenz. Consult the full prescribing information for the HMGCoA reductase inhibitor for guidance on individualizing the dose. Hormonal contraceptives Oral ethinyl estradiolnorgestimate  active metabolites of norgestimate A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. Efavirenz had no effect on ethinyl estradiol concentrations, but progestin levels (norelgestromin and levonorgestrel) were markedly decreased. No effect of ethinyl estradiolnorgestimate on efavirenz plasma concentrations was observed. Implant etonogestrel  etonogestrel A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. The interaction between etonogestrel and efavirenz has not been studied. Decreased exposure of etonogestrel may be expected. There have been postmarketing reports of contraceptive failure with etonogestrel in efavirenzexposed patients. Immunosuppressants cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and others metabolized by CYP3A  immunosuppressant Decreased exposure of the immunosuppressant may be expected due to CYP3A induction by efavirenz. These immunosuppressants are not anticipated to affect exposure of efavirenz. Dose adjustments of the immunosuppressant may be required. Close monitoring of immunosuppressant concentrations for at least 2 weeks (until stable concentrations are reached) is recommended when starting or stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. Narcotic analgesic methadone  methadone concentration Coadministration of efavirenz in HIV1 infected individuals with a history of injection drug use resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal. Methadone dose was increased by a mean of 22 to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. This table is not all inclusive. Cannabinoid Test Interaction Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. Falsepositive urine cannabinoid test results have been observed in nonHIVinfected volunteers receiving efavirenz when the Microgenics Cedia DAU MultiLevel THC assay was used for screening. Negative results were obtained when more specific confirmatory testing was performed with gas chromatographymass spectrometry. For more information, please consult the SUSTIVA prescribing information.</td></tr>

Generic name efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (eh FAH vih renz, em tri SIT uh bean and te NOE fo veer dye soe PROX il FYOU mar ate) Read the Patient Information that comes with ATRIPLA before you start taking it and each time you get a refill since there may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. You should stay under a healthcare providers care when taking ATRIPLA. Do not change or stop your medicine without first talking with your healthcare provider. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have any questions about ATRIPLA. What is the most important information I should know about ATRIPLA? Some people who have taken medicine like ATRIPLA (which contains nucleoside analogs) have developed a serious condition called lactic acidosis (build up of an acid in the blood). Lactic acidosis can be a medical emergency and may need to be treated in the hospital. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get the following signs or symptoms of lactic acidosis You feel very weak or tired. You have unusual (not normal) muscle pain. You have trouble breathing. You have stomach pain with nausea and vomiting. You feel cold, especially in your arms and legs. You feel dizzy or lightheaded. You have a fast or irregular heartbeat. Some people who have taken medicines like ATRIPLA have developed serious liver problems called hepatotoxicity, with liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and fat in the liver (steatosis). Call your healthcare provider right away if you get the following signs or symptoms of liver problems Your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice). Your urine turns dark. Your bowel movements (stools) turn light in color. You dont feel like eating food for several days or longer. You feel sick to your stomach (nausea). You have lower stomach area (abdominal) pain. You may be more likely to get lactic acidosis or liver problems if you are female, very <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> (obese), or have been taking nucleoside analogcontaining medicines, like ATRIPLA, for a long time. If you also have hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and you stop taking ATRIPLA, you may get a "flareup" of your hepatitis. A "flareup" is when the disease suddenly returns in a worse way than before. Patients with HBV who stop taking ATRIPLA need close medical followup for several months, including medical exams and blood tests to check for hepatitis that could be getting worse. ATRIPLA is not approved for the treatment of HBV, so you must discuss your HBV therapy with your healthcare provider. What is ATRIPLA? ATRIPLA contains 3 medicines, SUSTIVA (efavirenz), EMTRIVA (emtricitabine) and VIREAD (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate also called tenofovir DF) combined in one pill. EMTRIVA and VIREAD are HIV1 (human immunodeficiency virus) nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and SUSTIVA is an HIV1 nonnucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). VIREAD and EMTRIVA are the components of TRUVADA. ATRIPLA can be used alone as a complete regimen, or in combination with other antiHIV1 medicines to treat people with HIV1 infection. ATRIPLA is for adults and children 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 40 kg (at least 88 lbs). ATRIPLA is not recommended for children younger than 12 years of age. ATRIPLA has not been studied in adults over 65 years of age. HIV infection destroys CD4 T cells, which are important to the immune system. The immune system helps fight infection. After a large number of T cells are destroyed, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) develops. ATRIPLA helps block HIV1 reverse transcriptase, a viral chemical in your body (enzyme) that is needed for HIV1 to multiply. ATRIPLA lowers the amount of HIV1 in the blood (viral load). ATRIPLA may also help to increase the number of T cells (CD4 cells), allowing your immune system to improve. Lowering the amount of HIV1 in the blood lowers the chance of death or infections that happen when your immune system is weak (opportunistic infections). Does ATRIPLA cure HIV1 or AIDS? ATRIPLA does not cure HIV1 infection or AIDS and you may continue to experience illnesses associated with HIV1 infection, including opportunistic infections. You should remain under the care of a doctor when using ATRIPLA. Who should not take ATRIPLA? Together with your healthcare provider, you need to decide whether ATRIPLA is right for you. Do not take ATRIPLA if you are allergic to ATRIPLA or any of its ingredients. The active ingredients of ATRIPLA are efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking ATRIPLA? Tell your healthcare provider if you Are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see "What should I avoid while taking ATRIPLA?"). Are breastfeeding (see "What should I avoid while taking ATRIPLA?"). Have kidney problems or are undergoing kidney dialysis treatment. Have bone problems. Have liver problems, including hepatitis B virus infection. Your healthcare provider may want to do tests to check your liver while you take ATRIPLA or may switch you to another medicine. Have ever had mental illness or are using drugs or alcohol. Have ever had seizures or are taking medicine for seizures. What important information should I know about taking other medicines with ATRIPLA? ATRIPLA may change the effect of other medicines, including the ones for HIV1, and may cause serious side effects. Your healthcare provider may change your other medicines or change their doses. Other medicines, including herbal products, may affect ATRIPLA. For this reason, it is very important to let all your healthcare providers and pharmacists know what medications, herbal supplements, or vitamins you are taking. MEDICINES YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE WITH ATRIPLA The following medicines may cause serious and lifethreatening side effects when taken with ATRIPLA. You should not take any of these medicines while taking ATRIPLA Vascor (bepridil), Propulsid (cisapride), Versed (midazolam), Orap (pimozide), Halcion (triazolam), ergot medications (for example, Wigraine and Cafergot). ATRIPLA also should not be used with Combivir (lamivudinezidovudine), COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, Epivir, EpivirHBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfatelamivudine), Trizivir (abacavir sulfatelamivudinezidovudine), TRUVADA, or VIREAD. ATRIPLA also should not be used with SUSTIVA unless recommended by your healthcare provider. Vfend (voriconazole) should not be taken with ATRIPLA since it may lose its effect or may increase the chance of having side effects from ATRIPLA. Do not take St. Johns wort (Hypericum perforatum), or products containing St. Johns wort with ATRIPLA. St. Johns wort is an herbal product sold as a dietary supplement. Talk with your healthcare provider if you are taking or are planning to take St. Johns wort. Taking St. Johns wort may decrease ATRIPLA levels and lead to increased viral load and possible resistance to ATRIPLA or crossresistance to other antiHIV1 drugs. ATRIPLA should not be used with HEPSERA (adefovir dipivoxil). It is also important to tell your healthcare provider if you are taking any of the following Fortovase, Invirase (saquinavir), Biaxin (clarithromycin), Noxafil (posaconazole), or Sporanox (itraconazole) these medicines may need to be replaced with another medicine when taken with ATRIPLA. Calcium channel blockers such as Cardizem or Tiazac (diltiazem), Covera HS or Isoptin (verapamil) and others Crixivan (indinavir), Selzentry (maraviroc) the immunosuppressant medicines cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune, and others), Prograf (tacrolimus), or Rapamune (sirolimus) Methadone Mycobutin (rifabutin) Rifampin cholesterollowering medicines such as Lipitor (atorvastatin), Pravachol (pravastatin sodium), and Zocor (simvastatin) or the antidepressant medications bupropion (Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL, and Zyban) or Zoloft (sertraline) dose changes may be needed when these drugs are taken with ATRIPLA. Videx, Videx EC (didanosine) tenofovir DF (a component of ATRIPLA) may increase the amount of didanosine in your blood, which could result in more side effects. You may need to be monitored more carefully if you are taking ATRIPLA and didanosine together. Also, the dose of didanosine may need to be changed. Reyataz (atazanavir sulfate) or Kaletra (lopinavirritonavir) these medicines may increase the amount of tenofovir DF (a component of ATRIPLA) in your blood, which could result in more side effects. Reyataz is not recommended with ATRIPLA. You may need to be monitored more carefully if you are taking ATRIPLA and Kaletra together. Also, the dose of Kaletra may need to be changed. Medicine for seizures for example, Dilantin (phenytoin), Tegretol (carbamazepine), or phenobarbital your healthcare provider may want to switch you to another medicine or check drug levels in your blood from time to time. These are not all the medicines that may cause problems if you take ATRIPLA. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about all medicines that you take. Keep a complete list of all the prescription and nonprescription medicines as well as any herbal remedies that you are taking, how much you take, and how often you take them. Make a new list when medicines or herbal remedies are added or stopped, or if the dose changes. Give copies of this list to all of your healthcare providers and pharmacists every time you visit your healthcare provider or fill a prescription. This will give your healthcare provider a complete picture of the medicines you use. Then he or she can decide the best approach for your situation. How should I take ATRIPLA? Take the exact amount of ATRIPLA your healthcare provider prescribes. Never change the dose on your own. Do not stop this medicine unless your healthcare provider tells you to stop. You should take ATRIPLA on an empty stomach. Swallow ATRIPLA with water. Taking ATRIPLA at bedtime may make some side effects less bothersome. Do not miss a dose of ATRIPLA. If you forget to take ATRIPLA, take the missed dose right away, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the next dose. Carry on with your regular dosing schedule. If you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. If you believe you took more than the prescribed amount of ATRIPLA, contact your local poison control center or emergency room right away. Tell your healthcare provider if you start any new medicine or change how you take old ones. Your doses may need adjustment. When your ATRIPLA supply starts to run low, get more from your healthcare provider or pharmacy. This is very important because the amount of virus in your blood may increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may develop resistance to ATRIPLA and become harder to treat. Your healthcare provider may want to do blood tests to check for certain side effects while you take ATRIPLA. What should I avoid while taking ATRIPLA? Women should not become pregnant while taking ATRIPLA and for 12 weeks after stopping it. Serious birth defects have been seen in the babies of animals and women treated with efavirenz (a component of ATRIPLA) during pregnancy. It is not known whether efavirenz caused these defects. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you are pregnant. Also talk with your healthcare provider if you want to become pregnant. Women should not rely only on hormonebased birth control, such as pills, injections, or implants, because ATRIPLA may make these contraceptives ineffective. Women must use a reliable form of barrier contraception, such as a condom or diaphragm, even if they also use other methods of birth control. Efavirenz, a component of ATRIPLA, may remain in your blood for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after you stop taking ATRIPLA. Do not breastfeed if you are taking ATRIPLA. We do not know if ATRIPLA can be passed to your baby in your breast milk and whether it could harm your baby. Also, mothers with HIV1 should not breastfeed because HIV1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk. Talk with your healthcare provider if you are breastfeeding. You should stop breastfeeding or may need to use a different medicine. Taking ATRIPLA with alcohol or other medicines causing similar side effects as ATRIPLA, such as drowsiness, may increase those side effects. Do not take any other medicines, including prescription and nonprescription medicines and herbal products, without checking with your healthcare provider. Avoid doing things that can spread HIV1 to others. Do not share needles or other injection equipment. Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades. Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safe sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood. What are the possible side effects of ATRIPLA? ATRIPLA may cause the following serious side effects Lactic acidosis (buildup of an acid in the blood). Lactic acidosis can be a medical emergency and may need to be treated in the hospital. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get signs of lactic acidosis. (See "What is the most important information I should know about ATRIPLA?") Serious liver problems (hepatotoxicity), with liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and fat in the liver (steatosis). Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any signs of liver problems. (See "What is the most important information I should know about ATRIPLA?") "Flareups" of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in which the disease suddenly returns in a worse way than before, can occur if you have HBV and you stop taking ATRIPLA. Your healthcare provider will monitor your condition for several months after stopping ATRIPLA if you have both HIV1 and HBV infection and may recommend treatment for your HBV. ATRIPLA is not approved for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infection. If you have advanced liver disease and stop treatment with ATRIPLA, the "flareup" of hepatitis B may cause your liver function to decline. Serious psychiatric problems. A small number of patients may experience severe depression, strange thoughts, or angry behavior while taking ATRIPLA. Some patients have thoughts of suicide and a few have actually committed suicide. These problems may occur more often in patients who have had mental illness. Contact your healthcare provider right away if you think you are having these psychiatric symptoms, so your healthcare provider can decide if you should continue to take ATRIPLA. Kidney problems (including decline or failure of kidney function). If you have had kidney problems in the past or take other medicines that can cause kidney problems, your healthcare provider should do regular blood tests to check your kidneys. Symptoms that may be related to kidney problems include a high volume of urine, thirst, muscle pain, and muscle weakness. Other serious liver problems. Some patients have experienced serious liver problems including liver failure resulting in transplantation or death. Most of these serious side effects occurred in patients with a chronic liver disease such as hepatitis infection, but there have also been a few reports in patients without any existing liver disease. Changes in bone mineral density (thinning bones). Laboratory tests show changes in the bones of patients treated with tenofovir DF, a component of ATRIPLA. Some HIV patients treated with tenofovir DF developed thinning of the bones (osteopenia) which could lead to fractures. If you have had bone problems in the past, your healthcare provider may need to do tests to check your bone mineral density or may prescribe medicines to help your bone mineral density. Additionally, bone pain and softening of the bone (which may contribute to fractures) may occur as a consequence of kidney problems. Common side effects Patients may have dizziness, headache, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, trouble concentrating, andor unusual dreams during treatment with ATRIPLA. These side effects may be reduced if you take ATRIPLA at bedtime on an empty stomach. They also tend to go away after you have taken the medicine for a few weeks. If you have these common side effects, such as dizziness, it does not mean that you will also have serious psychiatric problems, such as severe depression, strange thoughts, or angry behavior. Tell your healthcare provider right away if any of these side effects continue or if they bother you. It is possible that these symptoms may be more severe if ATRIPLA is used with alcohol or mood altering (street) drugs. If you are dizzy, have trouble concentrating, or are drowsy, avoid activities that may be dangerous, such as driving or operating machinery. Rash may be common. Rashes usually go away without any change in treatment. In a small number of patients, rash may be serious. If you develop a rash, call your healthcare provider right away. Rash may be a serious problem in some children. Tell your childs healthcare provider right away if you notice rash or any other side effects while your child is taking ATRIPLA. Other common side effects include tiredness, upset stomach, vomiting, gas, and diarrhea. Other possible side effects with ATRIPLA Changes in body fat. Changes in body fat develop in some patients taking anti HIV1 medicine. These changes may include an increased amount of fat in the upper back and neck ("buffalo hump"), in the breasts, and around the trunk. Loss of fat from the legs, arms, and face may also happen. The cause and longterm health effects of these fat changes are not known. Skin discoloration (small spots or freckles) may also happen with ATRIPLA. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after antiHIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the bodys immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. Additional side effects are inflammation of the pancreas, allergic reaction (including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), shortness of breath, pain, stomach pain, weakness and indigestion. Tell your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you notice any side effects while taking ATRIPLA. Contact your healthcare provider before stopping ATRIPLA because of side effects or for any other reason. This is not a complete list of side effects possible with ATRIPLA. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a more complete list of side effects of ATRIPLA and all the medicines you will take. How do I store ATRIPLA? Keep ATRIPLA and all other medicines out of reach of children. Store ATRIPLA at room temperature 77 F (25 C). Keep ATRIPLA in its original container and keep the container tightly closed. Do not keep medicine that is out of date or that you no longer need. If you throw any medicines away make sure that children will not find them. General information about ATRIPLA Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use ATRIPLA for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give ATRIPLA to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about ATRIPLA. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider. You can ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for information about ATRIPLA that is written for health professionals. Do not use ATRIPLA if the seal over bottle opening is broken or missing. What are the ingredients of ATRIPLA? Active Ingredients efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Inactive Ingredients croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate. The film coating contains black iron oxide, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, red iron oxide, talc, and titanium dioxide.</td></tr>

Table 1 Drugs That Are Contraindicated or Not Recommended for Use With ATRIPLA Drug Class Drug Name Clinical Comment Antifungal voriconazole Efavirenz significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations, and coadministration may decrease the therapeutic effectiveness of voriconazole. Also, voriconazole significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of efavirenzassociated side effects. Because ATRIPLA is a fixeddose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered. See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Tables 5 and 6 Ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine) Potential for serious andor lifethreatening reactions such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues. Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam Potential for serious andor lifethreatening reactions such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression. Calcium channel blocker bepridil Potential for serious andor lifethreatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. GI motility agent cisapride Potential for serious andor lifethreatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Neuroleptic pimozide Potential for serious andor lifethreatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. St. Johns wort (Hypericum perforatum) May lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to efavirenz or to the class of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)."</td></tr>

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects Study 934 Study 934 was an openlabel activecontrolled trial in which 511 antiretroviralnaive subjects received either emtricitabine  tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz (N257) or zidovudinelamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N254). The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10, any severity) occurring in Study 934 include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Adverse reactions observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials of the individual components (Table 2).

From Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabinetenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine  tenofovir DF with efavirenz. Rash event includes rash, exfoliative rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculopapular, rash pruritic, and rash vesicular. Study 073 In Study 073, subjects with stable, virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy and no history of virologic failure were randomized to receive ATRIPLA or to stay on their baseline regimen. The adverse reactions observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those seen in Study 934 and those seen with the individual components of ATRIPLA when each was administered in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, or Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate In addition to the adverse reactions in Study 934 and Study 073 the following adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz The most significant adverse reactions observed in subjects treated with efavirenz are nervous system symptoms See Warnings and Precautions (5.6), psychiatric symptoms See Warnings and Precautions (5.5), and rash See Warnings and Precautions (5.9). Selected adverse reactions of moderatesevere intensity observed in greater than or equal to 2 of efavirenztreated subjects in two controlled clinical trials included pain, impaired concentration, abnormal dreams, somnolence, anorexia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nervousness, and pruritus. Pancreatitis has also been reported, although a causal relationship with efavirenz has not been established. Asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels were observed in a significantly higher number of subjects treated with efavirenz 600 mg than in control subjects. Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5 of treatmentexperienced or treatmentnaive subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials include arthralgia, increased cough, dyspepsia, fever, myalgia, pain, abdominal pain, back pain, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), pneumonia, rhinitis and rash event (including rash, pruritus, maculopapular rash, urticaria, vesiculobullous rash, pustular rash and allergic reaction). Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabinetreated subjects it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms andor soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Efavirenz In a pediatric clinical trial in 57 NRTIexperienced subjects aged 3 to 16 years, the type and frequency of adverse experiences was generally similar to that of adult subjects with the exception of a higher incidence of rash, which was reported in 46 (2657) of pediatric subjects compared to 26 of adults, and a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 rash reported in 5 (357) of pediatric subjects compared to 0.9 of adults See Warnings and Precautions (5.9). For additional information, please consult the SUSTIVA prescribing information. Emtricitabine In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7 and 32, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with emtricitabine in the larger of two openlabel, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with tenofovir DF were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of tenofovir DF in adults See Warnings and Precautions (5.11). Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials (Table 3).

Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those in Study 934. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described for Study 934 (Table 3), Grade 34 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (greater than 2.5  upper limit of normal (ULN)), increased pancreatic amylase (greater than 2.0  ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (less than 40 or greater than 250 mgdL), and increased serum lipase (greater than 2.0  ULN) occurred in up to 3 of subjects treated with emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Hepatic Events In Study 934, 19 subjects treated with efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF and 20 subjects treated with efavirenz and fixeddose zidovudinelamivudine were hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody positive. Among these coinfected subjects, one subject (119) in the efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF arm had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. In the fixeddose zidovudinelamivudine arm, two subjects (220) had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. No HBV andor HCV coinfected subject discontinued from the trial due to hepatobiliary disorders See Warnings and Precautions (5.10). The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>"INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS See FDAapproved patient labeling (Patient Information) A statement to patients and healthcare providers is included on the products bottle labels ALERT Find out about medicines that should NOT be taken with ATRIPLA. ATRIPLA may interact with some drugs therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other prescription, nonprescription medication, or herbal products, particularly St. Johns wort. Patients should be advised that ATRIPLA is not a cure for HIV1 infection and patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with HIV1 infection, including opportunistic infections. Patients should remain under the care of a physician when using ATRIPLA. Patients should avoid doing things that can spread HIV1 to others. Do not share needles or other injection equipment. Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades. Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safe sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood. Do not breastfeed. We do not know if ATRIPLA can be passed to your baby in your breast milk and whether it could harm your baby. Also, mothers with HIV1 should not breastfeed because HIV1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk. The long term effects of ATRIPLA are unknown. Redistribution or accumulation of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy and that the cause and longterm health effects of these conditions are not known. ATRIPLA should not be coadministered with COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, or VIREAD or drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir, Epivir, EpivirHBV, Epzicom, or Trizivir. SUSTIVA should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless needed for doseadjustment See Warnings and Precautions (5.4). ATRIPLA should not be administered with HEPSERA See Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Patients should be informed that lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Treatment will be suspended in any patients who develop clinical symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (including nausea, vomiting, unusual or unexpected stomach discomfort, and weakness) See Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Patients with HIV1 should be tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy. Patients should be advised that severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV1 and have discontinued EMTRIVA (emtricitabine) or VIREAD (tenofovir DF), which are components of ATRIPLA. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, has been reported. ATRIPLA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent See Warnings and Precautions (5.7). Patients should be informed that decreases in bone mineral density have been observed with the use of tenofovir DF. Bone mineral density monitoring may be performed in patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss See Warnings and Precautions (5.11). Patients should be advised to take ATRIPLA orally on an empty stomach and that it is important to take ATRIPLA on a regular dosing schedule to avoid missing doses. Patients should be informed that central nervous system symptoms (NSS) including dizziness, insomnia, impaired concentration, drowsiness, and abnormal dreams are commonly reported during the first weeks of therapy with efavirenz. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of these symptoms, which are likely to improve with continued therapy. Patients should be alerted to the potential for additive effects when ATRIPLA is used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs. Patients should be instructed that if they experience NSS they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery See Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Dosage and Administration (2). Patients should be informed that serious psychiatric symptoms including severe depression, suicide attempts, aggressive behavior, delusions, paranoia, and psychosislike symptoms have been reported in patients receiving efavirenz. If they experience severe psychiatric adverse experiences they should seek immediate medical evaluation. Patients should be advised to inform their physician of any history of mental illness or substance abuse See Warnings and Precautions (5.5). Patients should be informed that a common side effect is rash. Rashes usually go away without any change in treatment. However, since rash may be serious, patients should be advised to contact their physician promptly if rash occurs. Women receiving ATRIPLA should be instructed to avoid pregnancy See Warnings and Precautions (5.8). A reliable form of barrier contraception must always be used in combination with other methods of contraception, including oral or other hormonal contraception. Because of the long halflife of efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of ATRIPLA is recommended. Women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking ATRIPLA. If this drug is used during the first trimester of pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, she should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>"DESCRIPTION ATRIPLA is a fixeddose combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF). SUSTIVA is the brand name for efavirenz, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. EMTRIVA is the brand name for emtricitabine, a synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine. VIREAD is the brand name for tenofovir DF, which is converted in vivo to tenofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (nucleotide) analog of adenosine 5monophosphate. VIREAD and EMTRIVA are the components of TRUVADA. ATRIPLA tablets are for oral administration. Each tablet contains 600 mg of efavirenz, 200 mg of emtricitabine, and 300 mg of tenofovir DF (which is equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil) as active ingredients. The tablets include the following inactive ingredients croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium lauryl sulfate. The tablets are filmcoated with a coating material containing black iron oxide, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, red iron oxide, talc, and titanium dioxide. Efavirenz Efavirenz is chemically described as (S)6chloro4(cyclopropylethynyl)1,4dihydro4(trifluoromethyl)2H3,1benzoxazin2one. Its molecular formula is C14H9ClF3NO2 and its structural formula is Efavirenz is a white to slightly pink crystalline powder with a molecular mass of 315.68. It is practically insoluble in water (less than 10 gmL). Emtricitabine The chemical name of emtricitabine is 5fluoro1(2R,5S)2(hydroxymethyl)1,3oxathiolan5ylcytosine. Emtricitabine is the () enantiomer of a thio analog of cytidine, which differs from other cytidine analogs in that it has a fluorine in the 5position. It has a molecular formula of C8H10FN3O3S and a molecular weight of 247.24. It has the following structural formula Emtricitabine is a white to offwhite crystalline powder with a solubility of approximately 112 mgmL in water at 25 C. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Tenofovir DF is a fumaric acid salt of the bisisopropoxycarbonyloxymethyl ester derivative of tenofovir. The chemical name of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is 9(R)2bis(isopropoxycarbonyl)oxy methoxyphosphinylmethoxypropyladenine fumarate (11). It has a molecular formula of C19H30N5O10P  C4H4O4 and a molecular weight of 635.52. It has the following structural formula Tenofovir DF is a white to offwhite crystalline powder with a solubility of 13.4 mgmL in water at 25 C. MM1 MM2 MM3"</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Recommended dose in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) One tablet once daily taken orally on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. (2) Dose in renal impairment Should not be administered in patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mLmin. (2) With rifampin coadministration, an additional 200 mgday of efavirenz is recommended for patients weighing 50 kg or more. (2) Adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with body weight at least 40 kg (at least 88 lbs) The dose of ATRIPLA is one tablet once daily taken orally on an empty stomach. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of nervous system symptoms. Renal Impairment Because ATRIPLA is a fixeddose combination, it should not be prescribed for patients requiring dosage adjustment such as those with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 50 mLmin). Rifampin Coadministration When ATRIPLA is administered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mgday of efavirenz is recommended See Drug Interactions (7.3), Table 4, and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Table 5.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY For additional information on Mechanism of Action, Antiviral Activity, Resistance and Cross Resistance, please consult the SUSTIVA, EMTRIVA and VIREAD prescribing information. ATRIPLA is a fixeddose combination of antiviral drugs efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. See Clinical Pharmacology (12.4). ATRIPLA One ATRIPLA tablet is bioequivalent to one SUSTIVA tablet (600 mg) plus one EMTRIVA capsule (200 mg) plus one VIREAD tablet (300 mg) following singledose administration to fasting healthy subjects (N45). Efavirenz In HIV1 infected subjects timetopeak plasma concentrations were approximately 35 hours and steadystate plasma concentrations were reached in 610 days. In 35 HIV1 infected subjects receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steadystate Cmax was 12.9  3.7 M (mean  SD), Cmin was 5.6  3.2 M, and AUC was 184  73 Mhr. Efavirenz is highly bound (approximately 99.599.75) to human plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. Following administration of 14Clabeled efavirenz, 1434 of the dose was recovered in the urine (mostly as metabolites) and 1661 was recovered in feces (mostly as parent drug). In vitro studies suggest CYP3A and CYP2B6 are the major isozymes responsible for efavirenz metabolism. Efavirenz has been shown to induce CYP enzymes, resulting in induction of its own metabolism. Efavirenz has a terminal halflife of 5276 hours after single doses and 4055 hours after multiple doses. Emtricitabine Following oral administration, emtricitabine is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 12 hours postdose. Following multiple dose oral administration of emtricitabine to 20 HIV1 infected subjects, the steadystate plasma emtricitabine Cmax was 1.8  0.7 gmL (mean  SD) and the AUC over a 24hour dosing interval was 10.0  3.1 ghrmL. The mean steady state plasma trough concentration at 24 hours postdose was 0.09 gmL. The mean absolute bioavailability of emtricitabine was 93. Less than 4 of emtricitabine binds to human plasma proteins in vitro and the binding is independent of concentration over the range of 0.02200 gmL. Following administration of radiolabelled emtricitabine, approximately 86 is recovered in the urine and 13 is recovered as metabolites. The metabolites of emtricitabine include 3sulfoxide diastereomers and their glucuronic acid conjugate. Emtricitabine is eliminated by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance in adults with normal renal function of 213  89 mLmin (mean  SD). Following a single oral dose, the plasma emtricitabine halflife is approximately 10 hours. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Following oral administration of a single 300 mg dose of tenofovir DF to HIV1 infected subjects in the fasted state, maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) were achieved in 1.0  0.4 hrs (mean  SD) and Cmax and AUC values were 296  90 ngmL and 2287  685 nghrmL, respectively. The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir DF in fasted subjects is approximately 25. Less than 0.7 of tenofovir binds to human plasma proteins in vitro and the binding is independent of concentration over the range of 0.0125 gmL. Approximately 7080 of the intravenous dose of tenofovir is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine. Tenofovir is eliminated by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance in adults with normal renal function of 243  33 mLmin (mean  SD). Following a single oral dose, the terminal elimination halflife of tenofovir is approximately 17 hours. Effects of Food on Oral Absorption ATRIPLA has not been evaluated in the presence of food. Administration of efavirenz tablets with a high fat meal increased the mean AUC and Cmax of efavirenz by 28 and 79, respectively, compared to administration in the fasted state. Compared to fasted administration, dosing of tenofovir DF and emtricitabine in combination with either a high fat meal or a light meal increased the mean AUC and Cmax of tenofovir by 35 and 15, respectively, without affecting emtricitabine exposures See Dosage and Administration (2) and Patient Counseling Information (17.7). Special Populations Race Efavirenz The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz in HIV1 infected subjects appear to be similar among the racial groups studied. Emtricitabine No pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been identified following the administration of emtricitabine. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate There were insufficient numbers from racial and ethnic groups other than Caucasian to adequately determine potential pharmacokinetic differences among these populations following the administration of tenofovir DF. Gender Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir pharmacokinetics are similar in male and female subjects. Pediatric Patients ATRIPLA should only be administered to pediatric patients 12 years of age and weighing greater than or equal to 40 kg (greater than or equal to 88 lb). Efavirenz In an openlabel trial in NRTIexperienced pediatric subjects (mean age 8 years, range 316), the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz in pediatric subjects were similar to the pharmacokinetics in adults who received a 600 mg daily dose of efavirenz. In 48 pediatric subjects, receiving the equivalent of a 600 mg dose of efavirenz, mean ( SD) steadystate Cmax was 14.2  5.8 M, steadystate Cmin was 5.6  4.1 M, and AUC was 218  104 Mhr. Emtricitabine The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine at steady state were determined in 27 HIV1infected pediatric subjects 13 to 17 years of age receiving a daily dose of 6 mgkg up to a maximum dose of 240 mg oral solution or a 200 mg capsule 26 of 27 subjects in this age group received the 200 mg EMTRIVA capsule. Mean ( SD) Cmax and AUC were 2.7  0.9 gmL and 12.6  5.4 ghrmL, respectively. Exposures achieved in pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age were similar to those achieved in adults receiving a once daily dose of 200 mg. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Steadystate pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 8 HIV1 infected pediatric subjects (12 to less than 18 years). Mean ( SD) Cmax and AUCtau are 0.38  0.13 gmL and 3.39  1.22 ghrmL, respectively. Tenofovir exposure achieved in these pediatric subjects receiving oral daily doses of VIREAD 300 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving oncedaily doses of VIREAD 300 mg. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetics of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir have not been fully evaluated in the elderly (65 years of age and older) See Use in Specific Populations (8.5). Patients with Impaired Renal Function Efavirenz The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in subjects with renal insufficiency however, less than 1 of efavirenz is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal. Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF are altered in subjects with renal impairment. In subjects with creatinine clearance below 50 mLmin, Cmax and AUC0 of emtricitabine and tenofovir were increased See Warnings and Precautions (5.7). Patients with Hepatic Impairment Efavirenz A multipledose trial showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class A) compared with controls. There were insufficient data to determine whether moderate or severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class B or C) affects efavirenz pharmacokinetics. See Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6). Emtricitabine The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment however, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolized by liver enzymes, so the impact of liver impairment should be limited. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir following a 300 mg dose of tenofovir DF have been studied in nonHIV infected subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. There were no substantial alterations in tenofovir pharmacokinetics in subjects with hepatic impairment compared with unimpaired subjects. Assessment of Drug Interactions The drug interaction trials described were conducted with efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF as individual agents no drug interaction trials have been conducted using ATRIPLA. Efavirenz The steadystate pharmacokinetics of efavirenz and tenofovir were unaffected when efavirenz and tenofovir DF were administered together versus each agent dosed alone. Specific drug interaction trials have not been performed with efavirenz and NRTIs other than tenofovir, lamivudine, and zidovudine. Clinically significant interactions would not be expected based on NRTIs elimination pathways. Efavirenz has been shown in vivo to cause hepatic enzyme induction, thus increasing the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2B6. In vitro studies have shown that efavirenz inhibited CYP isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 with Ki values (8.517 M) in the range of observed efavirenz plasma concentrations. In in vitro studies, efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 (Ki values 82160 M) only at concentrations well above those achieved clinically. Coadministration of efavirenz with drugs primarily metabolized by 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 isozymes may result in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug. Drugs which induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations. Drug interaction trials were performed with efavirenz and other drugs likely to be coadministered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction. There was no clinically significant interaction observed between efavirenz and zidovudine, lamivudine, azithromycin, fluconazole, lorazepam, cetirizine, or paroxetine. Single doses of famotidine or an aluminum and magnesium antacid with simethicone had no effects on efavirenz exposures.

Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate The steadystate pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir were unaffected when emtricitabine and tenofovir DF were administered together versus each agent dosed alone. In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic drugdrug interaction studies have shown that the potential for CYP mediated interactions involving emtricitabine and tenofovir with other medicinal products is low. Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. No drugdrug interactions due to competition for renal excretion have been observed however, coadministration of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, andor the coadministered drug. Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine andor tenofovir. No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between emtricitabine and famciclovir, indinavir, stavudine, tenofovir DF and zidovudine. Similarly, no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between tenofovir DF and abacavir, efavirenz, emtricitabine, entecavir, indinavir, lamivudine, lopinavirritonavir, methadone, nelfinavir, oral contraceptives, ribavirin, saquinavirritonavir or tacrolimus in trials conducted in healthy volunteers. Following multiple dosing to HIVnegative subjects receiving either chronic methadone maintenance therapy, oral contraceptives, or single doses of ribavirin, steadystate tenofovir pharmacokinetics were similar to those observed in previous trials, indicating a lack of clinically significant drug interactions between these agents and tenofovir DF. The effects of coadministered drugs on the Cmax, AUC, and Cmin of tenofovir are shown in Table 7. The effects of coadministration of tenofovir DF on Cmax, AUC, and Cmin of coadministered drugs are shown in Table 8 and Table 9.

Table 9 summarizes the effects of tenofovir DF on the pharmacokinetics of didanosine. Concomitant dosing of tenofovir DF with didanosine buffered tablets or entericcoated capsules significantly increases the Cmax and AUC of didanosine. When didanosine 250 mg entericcoated capsules were administered with tenofovir DF, systemic exposures of didanosine were similar to those seen with the 400 mg entericcoated capsules alone under fasted conditions.

Efavirenz activity is mediated predominantly by noncompetitive inhibition of HIV1 reverse transcriptase (RT). HIV2 RT and human cellular DNA polymerases , , , and  are not inhibited by efavirenz. Emtricitabine Emtricitabine, a synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine, is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5triphosphate inhibits the activity of the HIV1 RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5triphosphate and by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA which results in chain termination. Emtricitabine 5triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerase , , , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase . Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Tenofovir DF is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analog of adenosine monophosphate. Tenofovir DF requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV1 RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases , , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase . Antiviral Activity Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate In combination studies evaluating the antiviral activity in cell culture of emtricitabine and efavirenz together, efavirenz and tenofovir together, and emtricitabine and tenofovir together, additive to synergistic antiviral effects were observed. Efavirenz The concentration of efavirenz inhibiting replication of wildtype laboratory adapted strains and clinical isolates in cell culture by 9095 (EC9095) ranged from 1.725 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and macrophagemonocyte cultures. Efavirenz demonstrated additive antiviral activity against HIV1 in cell culture when combined with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (delavirdine and nevirapine), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, and zidovudine), protease inhibitors (PIs) (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir), and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. Efavirenz demonstrated additive to antagonistic antiviral activity in cell culture with atazanavir. Efavirenz demonstrated antiviral activity against clade B and most nonclade B isolates (subtypes A, AE, AG, C, D, F, G, J, and N), but had reduced antiviral activity against group O viruses. Efavirenz is not active against HIV2. Emtricitabine The antiviral activity in cell culture of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGICCR5 cell line, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The 50 effective concentration (EC50) values for emtricitabine were in the range of 0.00130.64 M (0.00030.158 gmL). In drug combination studies of emtricitabine with NRTIs (abacavir, lamivudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, and zidovudine), NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine), and PIs (amprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir), additive to synergistic effects were observed. Emtricitabine displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.0070.075 M) and showed strain specific activity against HIV2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.0071.5 M). Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate The antiviral activity in cell culture of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocytemacrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.048.5 M. In drug combination studies of tenofovir with NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, and zidovudine), NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine), and PIs (amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir), additive to synergistic effects were observed. Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G and O (EC50 values ranged from 0.52.2 M) and showed strain specific activity against HIV2 (EC50 values ranged from 1.6 M to 5.5 M). Resistance Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate HIV1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir have been selected in cell culture and in clinical trials. Genotypic analysis of these isolates identified the M184VI andor K65R amino acid substitutions in the viral RT. In a clinical trial of treatmentnaive subjects Study 934, see Clinical Studies (14) resistance analysis was performed on HIV1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with greater than 400 copiesmL of HIV1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuations. Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N substitution, was the most common form of resistance that developed. Resistance to efavirenz occurred in 1319 analyzed subjects in the emtricitabine  tenofovir DF group and in 2129 analyzed subjects in the zidovudinelamivudine fixeddose combination group. The M184V amino acid substitution, associated with resistance to emtricitabine and lamivudine, was observed in 219 analyzed subject isolates in the emtricitabine  tenofovir DF group and in 1029 analyzed subject isolates in the zidovudinelamivudine group. Through 144 weeks of Study 934, no subjects developed a detectable K65R substitution in their HIV1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis. In a clinical trial of treatmentnaive subjects, isolates from 847 (17) analyzed subjects receiving tenofovir DF developed the K65R substitution through 144 weeks of therapy 7 of these occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment and one at Week 96. In treatment experienced subjects, 14304 (5) of tenofovir DF treated subjects with virologic failure through Week 96 showed greater than 1.4 fold (median 2.7) reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. Genotypic analysis of the resistant isolates showed a substitution in the HIV1 RT gene resulting in the K65R amino acid substitution. Efavirenz Clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility in cell culture to efavirenz have been obtained. The most frequently observed amino acid substitution in clinical trials with efavirenz is K103N (54). One or more RT substitutions at amino acid positions 98, 100, 101, 103, 106, 108, 188, 190, 225, 227, and 230 were observed in subjects failing treatment with efavirenz in combination with other antiretrovirals. Other resistance substitutions observed to emerge commonly included L100I (7), K101EQR (14), V108I (11), G190STA (7), P225H (18), and M230IL (11). HIV1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to efavirenz (greater than 380fold increase in EC90 value) emerged rapidly under selection in cell culture. Genotypic characterization of these viruses identified substitutions resulting in single amino acid substitutions L100I or V179D, double substitutions L100IV108I, and triple substitutions L100IV179DY181C in RT. Emtricitabine Emtricitabineresistant isolates of HIV1 have been selected in cell culture and in clinical trials. Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed that the reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine was associated with a substitution in the HIV1 RT gene at codon 184 which resulted in an amino acid substitution of methionine by valine or isoleucine (M184VI). Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate HIV1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir have been selected in cell culture. These viruses expressed a K65R substitution in RT and showed a 24 fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir. Cross Resistance Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Crossresistance has been recognized among NNRTIs. Cross resistance has also been recognized among certain NRTIs. The M184VI andor K65R substitutions selected in cell culture by the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir are also observed in some HIV1 isolates from subjects failing treatment with tenofovir in combination with either lamivudine or emtricitabine, and either abacavir or didanosine. Therefore, crossresistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors either or both of these amino acid substitutions. Efavirenz Clinical isolates previously characterized as efavirenzresistant were also phenotypically resistant in cell culture to delavirdine and nevirapine compared to baseline. Delavirdine andor nevirapineresistant clinical viral isolates with NNRTI resistanceassociated substitutions (A98G, L100I, K101EP, K103NS, V106A, Y181X, Y188X, G190X, P225H, F227L, or M230L) showed reduced susceptibility to efavirenz in cell culture. Greater than 90 of NRTIresistant isolates tested in cell culture retained susceptibility to efavirenz. Emtricitabine Emtricitabineresistant isolates (M184VI) were crossresistant to lamivudine and zalcitabine but retained susceptibility in cell culture to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, zidovudine, and NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine). HIV1 isolates containing the K65R substitution, selected in vivo by abacavir, didanosine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine, demonstrated reduced susceptibility to inhibition by emtricitabine. Viruses harboring substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to stavudine and zidovudine (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215YF, and K219QE) or didanosine (L74V) remained sensitive to emtricitabine. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate The K65R substitution selected by tenofovir is also selected in some HIV1 infected patients treated with abacavir, didanosine, or zalcitabine. HIV1 isolates with the K65R substitution also showed reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine and lamivudine. Therefore, crossresistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors the K65R substitution. HIV1 isolates from subjects (N20) whose HIV1 expressed a mean of 3 zidovudineassociated RT amino acid substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215YF, or K219QEN) showed a 3.1fold decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir. Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V substitution without zidovudine resistance associated substitutions (N8) had reduced response to VIREAD. Limited data are available for patients whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution (N3), Q151M substitution (N2), or T69 insertion (N4), all of whom had a reduced response."</td></tr>

Clinical Study 073 provides clinical experience in subjects with stable, virologic suppression and no history of virologic failure who switched from their current regimen to ATRIPLA. In antiretroviral treatmentexperienced patients, the use of ATRIPLA tablets may be considered for patients with HIV1 strains that are expected to be susceptible to the components of ATRIPLA as assessed by treatment history or by genotypic or phenotypic testing See Clinical Pharmacology (12.4). Study 934 Data through 144 weeks are reported for Study 934, a randomized, openlabel, activecontrolled multicenter trial comparing emtricitabine  tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz versus zidovudinelamivudine fixeddose combination administered in combination with efavirenz in 511 antiretroviralnaive subjects. From weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabinetenofovir DF fixeddose combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine  tenofovir DF with efavirenz. Subjects had a mean age of 38 years (range 1880), 86 were male, 59 were Caucasian and 23 were Black. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 245 cellsmm3 (range 21191) and median baseline plasma HIV1 RNA was 5.01 log10 copiesmL (range 3.566.54). Subjects were stratified by baseline CD4 cell count ( or 200 cellsmm3) and 41 had CD4 cell counts 200 cellsmm3. Fiftyone percent (51) of subjects had baseline viral loads 100,000 copiesmL. Treatment outcomes through 48 and 144 weeks for those subjects who did not have efavirenz resistance at baseline (N487) are presented in Table 10.

Subjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV1 RNA 400 copiesmL through Weeks 48 and 144. Includes confirmed viral rebound and failure to achieve confirmed HIV1 RNA 400 copiesmL through Weeks 48 and 144. Includes lost to followup, patient withdrawal, noncompliance, protocol violation and other reasons. Through Week 48, 84 and 73 of subjects in the emtricitabine  tenofovir DF group and the zidovudinelamivudine group, respectively, achieved and maintained HIV1 RNA 400 copiesmL (71 and 58 through Week 144). The difference in the proportion of subjects who achieved and maintained HIV1 RNA 400 copiesmL through 48 weeks largely results from the higher number of discontinuations due to adverse events and other reasons in the zidovudinelamivudine group in this openlabel trial. In addition, 80 and 70 of subjects in the emtricitabine  tenofovir DF group and the zidovudinelamivudine group, respectively, achieved and maintained HIV1 RNA 50 copiesmL through Week 48 (64 and 56 through Week 144). The mean increase from baseline in CD4 cell count was 190 cellsmm3 in the emtricitabine  tenofovir DF group and 158 cellsmm3 in the zidovudinelamivudine group at Week 48 (312 and 271 cellsmm3 at Week 144). Through 48 weeks, 7 subjects in the emtricitabine  tenofovir DF group and 5 subjects in the zidovudinelamivudine group experienced a new CDC Class C event (10 and 6 subjects through 144 weeks). Study 073 Study 073 was a 48week openlabel, randomized clinical trial in subjects with stable, virologic suppression on combination antiretroviral therapy consisting of at least two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) administered in combination with a protease inhibitor (with or without ritonavir) or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). To be enrolled, subjects were to have HIV1 RNA 200 copiesmL for at least 12 weeks on their current regimen prior to trial entry with no known HIV1 substitutions conferring resistance to the components of ATRIPLA and no history of virologic failure. The trial compared the efficacy of switching to ATRIPLA or staying on the baseline antiretroviral regimen (SBR). Subjects were randomized in a 21 ratio to switch to ATRIPLA (N203) or stay on SBR (N97). Subjects had a mean age of 43 years (range 22 to 73 years), 88 were male, 68 were white, 29 were black or AfricanAmerican, and 3 were of other races. At baseline, median CD4 cell count was 516 cellsmm3 and 96 had HIV1 RNA 50 copiesmL. The median time since onset of antiretroviral therapy was 3 years and 88 of subjects were receiving their first antiretroviral regimen at trial enrollment. At Week 48, 89 and 87 of subjects who switched to ATRIPLA maintained HIV RNA 200 copiesmL and 50 copiesmL, respectively, compared to 88 and 85 who remained on SBR this difference was not statistically significant. No changes in CD4 cell counts from baseline to Week 48 were observed in either treatment arm.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Women should avoid pregnancy while receiving ATRIPLA and for 12 weeks after discontinuation. (5.8) Nursing mothers Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed. (8.3) Hepatic impairment ATRIPLA is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Use caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. (5.10, 8.6) Pediatrics The incidence of rash was higher than in adults. (5.9, 6.1) Pregnancy Category D See Warnings and Precautions (5.8) Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry To monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant women, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients who become pregnant by calling (800) 2584263. Efavirenz As of July 2010, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has received prospective reports of 792 pregnancies exposed to efavirenzcontaining regimens, nearly all of which were firsttrimester exposures (718 pregnancies). Birth defects occurred in 17 of 604 live births (firsttrimester exposure) and 2 of 69 live births (secondthirdtrimester exposure). One of these prospectively reported defects with firsttrimester exposure was a neural tube defect. A single case of anophthalmia with firsttrimester exposure to efavirenz has also been prospectively reported however, this case included severe oblique facial clefts and amniotic banding, a known association with anophthalmia. There have been six retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, including meningomyelocele. All mothers were exposed to efavirenzcontaining regimens in the first trimester. Although a causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established, similar defects have been observed in preclinical studies of efavirenz. Animal Data Effects of efavirenz on embryofetal development have been studied in three nonclinical species (cynomolgus monkeys, rats, and rabbits). In monkeys, efavirenz 60 mgkgday was administered to pregnant females throughout pregnancy (gestation days 20 through 150). The maternal systemic drug exposures (AUC) were 1.3 times the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (600 mgday), with fetal umbilical venous drug concentrations approximately 0.7 times the maternal values. Three fetuses of 20 fetusesinfants had one or more malformations there were no malformed fetuses or infants from placebotreated mothers. The malformations that occurred in these three monkey fetuses included anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia in one fetus, microophthalmia in a second, and cleft palate in the third. There was no NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) established for this study because only one dosage was evaluated. In rats, efavirenz was administered either during organogenesis (gestation days 7 to 18) or from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 at 50, 100, or 200 mgkgday. Administration of 200 mgkgday in rats was associated with increase in the incidence of early resorptions and doses 100 mgkgday and greater were associated with early neonatal mortality. The AUC at the NOAEL (50 mgkgday) in this rat study was 0.1 times that in humans at the recommended clinical dose. Drug concentrations in the milk on lactation day 10 were approximately 8 times higher than those in maternal plasma. In pregnant rabbits, efavirenz was neither embryo lethal nor teratogenic when administered at doses of 25, 50, and 75 mgkgday over the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 through 18). The AUC at the NOAEL (75 mgkgday) in rabbits was 0.4 times that in humans at the recommended clinical dose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV1. Studies in rats have demonstrated that both efavirenz and tenofovir are secreted in milk. It is not known whether efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir is excreted in human milk. Because of both the potential for HIV1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving ATRIPLA. ATRIPLA should only be administered to pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with a body weight greater than or equal to 40 kg (greater than or equal to 88 lbs). Because ATRIPLA is a fixeddose combination tablet, the dose adjustments recommended for pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age for each individual component cannot be made with ATRIPLA See Warnings and Precautions (5.9, 5.11), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Clinical trials of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for the elderly patients should be cautious, keeping in mind the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. ATRIPLA is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because there are insufficient data to determine an appropriate dose. Patients with mild hepatic impairment may be treated with ATRIPLA at the approved dose. Because of the extensive cytochrome P450mediated metabolism of efavirenz and limited clinical experience in patients with hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised in administering ATRIPLA to these patients See Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Because ATRIPLA is a fixeddose combination, it should not be prescribed for patients requiring dosage adjustment such as those with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 50 mLmin) See Warnings and Precautions (5.7).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Efavirenz Longterm carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were carried out with efavirenz. Mice were dosed with 0, 25, 75, 150, or 300 mgkgday for 2 years. Incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas and pulmonary alveolarbronchiolar adenomas were increased above background in females. No increases in tumor incidence above background were seen in males. In studies in which rats were administered efavirenz at doses of 0, 25, 50, or 100 mgkgday for 2 years, no increases in tumor incidence above background were observed. The systemic exposure (based on AUCs) in mice was approximately 1.7fold that in humans receiving the 600mgday dose. The exposure in rats was lower than that in humans. The mechanism of the carcinogenic potential is unknown. However, in genetic toxicology assays, efavirenz showed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. These included bacterial mutation assays in S. typhimurium and E. coli, mammalian mutation assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells, chromosome aberration assays in human peripheral blood lymphocytes or Chinese hamster ovary cells, and an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. Given the lack of genotoxic activity of efavirenz, the relevance to humans of neoplasms in efavirenztreated mice is not known. Efavirenz did not impair mating or fertility of male or female rats, and did not affect sperm of treated male rats. The reproductive performance of offspring born to female rats given efavirenz was not affected. As a result of the rapid clearance of efavirenz in rats, systemic drug exposures achieved in these studies were equivalent to or below those achieved in humans given therapeutic doses of efavirenz. Emtricitabine In longterm carcinogenicity studies of emtricitabine, no drugrelated increases in tumor incidence were found in mice at doses up to 750 mgkgday (26 times the human systemic exposure at the therapeutic dose of 200 mgday) or in rats at doses up to 600 mgday (31 times the human systemic exposure at the therapeutic dose). Emtricitabine was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial test (Ames test), mouse lymphoma or mouse micronucleus assays. Emtricitabine did not affect fertility in male rats at approximately 140fold or in male and female mice at approximately 60fold higher exposures (AUC) than in humans given the recommended 200 mg daily dose. Fertility was normal in the offspring of mice exposed daily from before birth (in utero) through sexual maturity at daily exposures (AUC) of approximately 60fold higher than human exposures at the recommended 200 mg daily dose. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Longterm oral carcinogenicity studies of tenofovir DF in mice and rats were carried out at exposures up to approximately 16 times (mice) and 5 times (rats) those observed in humans at the therapeutic dose for HIV1 infection. At the high dose in female mice, liver adenomas were increased at exposures 16 times that in humans. In rats, the study was negative for carcinogenic findings at exposures up to 5 times that observed in humans at the therapeutic dose. Tenofovir DF was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and negative in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test). In an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, tenofovir DF was negative when administered to male mice. There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development when tenofovir DF was administered to male rats at a dose equivalent to 10 times the human dose based on body surface area comparisons for 28 days prior to mating and to female rats for 15 days prior to mating through day seven of gestation. There was, however, an alteration of the estrous cycle in female rats. Efavirenz Nonsustained convulsions were observed in 6 of 20 monkeys receiving efavirenz at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4 to 13fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Tenofovir and tenofovir DF administered in toxicology studies to rats, dogs and monkeys at exposures (based on AUCs) greater than or equal to 6fold those observed in humans caused bone toxicity. In monkeys the bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia. Osteomalacia observed in monkeys appeared to be reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation of tenofovir. In rats and dogs, the bone toxicity manifested as reduced bone mineral density. The mechanism(s) underlying bone toxicity is unknown. Evidence of renal toxicity was noted in 4 animal species administered tenofovir and tenofovir DF. Increases in serum creatinine, BUN, glycosuria, proteinuria, phosphaturia andor calciuria and decreases in serum phosphate were observed to varying degrees in these animals. These toxicities were noted at exposures (based on AUCs) 220 times higher than those observed in humans. The relationship of the renal abnormalities, particularly the phosphaturia, to the bone toxicity is not known.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>"OVERDOSAGE If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patients clinical status standard supportive treatment should then be applied as necessary. Administration of activated charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz. Hemodialysis can remove both emtricitabine and tenofovir DF (refer to detailed information below), but is unlikely to significantly remove efavirenz from the blood. Efavirenz Some patients accidentally taking 600 mg twice daily have reported increased nervous system symptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions. Emtricitabine Limited clinical experience is available at doses higher than the therapeutic dose of emtricitabine. In one clinical pharmacology trial single doses of emtricitabine 1200 mg were administered to 11 subjects. No severe adverse reactions were reported. Hemodialysis treatment removes approximately 30 of the emtricitabine dose over a 3hour dialysis period starting within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing (blood flow rate of 400 mLmin and a dialysate flow rate of 600 mLmin). It is not known whether emtricitabine can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Limited clinical experience at doses higher than the therapeutic dose of tenofovir DF 300 mg is available.

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious psychiatric symptoms Immediate medical evaluation is recommended. (5.5, 6.1) Nervous system symptoms (NSS) NSS are frequent, usually begin 12 days after initiating therapy and resolve in 24 weeks. Dosing at bedtime may improve tolerability. NSS are not predictive of onset of psychiatric symptoms. (2, 5.6) New onset or worsening renal impairment Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with ATRIPLA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering ATRIPLA with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.7) Pregnancy Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. A pregnancy registry is available. (5.8, 8.1) Rash Discontinue if severe rash develops. (5.9, 6.1) Hepatotoxicity Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment in patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C coinfection, marked transaminase elevations, or who are taking medications associated with liver toxicity. Among reported cases of hepatic failure, a few occurred in patients with no preexisting hepatic disease. (5.10, 6.3, 8.6) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathological fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.11) Convulsions Use caution in patients with a history of seizures. (5.12) Immune reconstitution syndrome May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.13) Redistributionaccumulation of body fat Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.14) Coadministration with other products Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, or VIREAD or with drugs containing lamivudine. SUSTIVA (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless required for doseadjustment when coadministered with rifampin. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs including tenofovir DF, a component of ATRIPLA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with ATRIPLA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). It is recommended that all patients with HIV1 be tested for the presence of chronic HBV before initiating antiretroviral therapy. ATRIPLA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of ATRIPLA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of ATRIPLA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with emtricitabine, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow up for at least several months after stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. If appropriate, initiation of antihepatitis B therapy may be warranted. ATRIPLA should not be administered with HEPSERA (adefovir dipivoxil) See Drug Interactions (7.2). Efavirenz plasma concentrations may be altered by substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A. Likewise, efavirenz may alter plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2B6 See Contraindications (4.2), Drug Interactions (7.1). Related drugs not for coadministration with ATRIPLA include COMPLERA (emtricitabinerilpivirinetenofovir DF), EMTRIVA (emtricitabine), TRUVADA (emtricitabinetenofovir DF), and VIREAD (tenofovir DF), which contain the same active components as ATRIPLA. SUSTIVA (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless needed for doseadjustment (e.g. with rifampin) See Dosage and Administration (2), Drug Interactions (7.1). Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, ATRIPLA should not be coadministered with drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudinezidovudine), Epivir, or EpivirHBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfatelamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfatelamivudinezidovudine). Serious psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In controlled trials of 1008 subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz for a mean of 2.1 years and 635 subjects treated with control regimens for a mean of 1.5 years, the frequency (regardless of causality) of specific serious psychiatric events among subjects who received efavirenz or control regimens, respectively, were severe depression (2.4, 0.9), suicidal ideation (0.7, 0.3), nonfatal suicide attempts (0.5, 0), aggressive behavior (0.4, 0.5), paranoid reactions (0.4, 0.3), and manic reactions (0.2, 0.3). When psychiatric symptoms similar to those noted above were combined and evaluated as a group in a multifactorial analysis of data from Study AI266006 (006), treatment with efavirenz was associated with an increase in the occurrence of these selected psychiatric symptoms. Other factors associated with an increase in the occurrence of these psychiatric symptoms were history of injection drug use, psychiatric history, and receipt of psychiatric medication at trial entry similar associations were observed in both the efavirenz and control treatment groups. In Study 006, onset of new serious psychiatric symptoms occurred throughout the trial for both efavirenztreated and controltreated subjects. One percent of efavirenztreated subjects discontinued or interrupted treatment because of one or more of these selected psychiatric symptoms. There have also been occasional postmarketing reports of death by suicide, delusions, and psychosislike behavior, although a causal relationship to the use of efavirenz cannot be determined from these reports. Patients with serious psychiatric adverse experiences should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits See Adverse Reactions (6). Fiftythree percent (5311008) of subjects receiving efavirenz in controlled trials reported central nervous system symptoms (any grade, regardless of causality) compared to 25 (156635) of subjects receiving control regimens. These symptoms included dizziness (28.1 of the 1008 subjects), insomnia (16.3), impaired concentration (8.3), somnolence (7.0), abnormal dreams (6.2), and hallucinations (1.2). Other reported symptoms were euphoria, confusion, agitation, amnesia, stupor, abnormal thinking, and depersonalization. The majority of these symptoms were mildmoderate (50.7) symptoms were severe in 2.0 of subjects. Overall, 2.1 of subjects discontinued therapy as a result. These symptoms usually begin during the first or second day of therapy and generally resolve after the first 24 weeks of therapy. After 4 weeks of therapy, the prevalence of nervous system symptoms of at least moderate severity ranged from 5 to 9 in subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz and from 3 to 5 in subjects treated with a control regimen. Patients should be informed that these common symptoms were likely to improve with continued therapy and were not predictive of subsequent onset of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms See Warnings and Precautions (5.5). Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of these nervous system symptoms See Dosage and Administration (2). Analysis of longterm data from Study 006, (median followup 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for subjects treated with efavirenz  zidovudine  lamivudine, efavirenz  indinavir, and indinavir  zidovudine  lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of newonset nervous system symptoms among efavirenztreated subjects were generally similar to those in the indinavircontaining control arm. Patients receiving ATRIPLA should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system effects when ATRIPLA is used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness, impaired concentration, andor drowsiness should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney however, efavirenz is not. Since ATRIPLA is a combination product and the dose of the individual components cannot be altered, patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mLmin should not receive ATRIPLA. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF See Adverse Reactions (6.3). It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with ATRIPLA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in patients at risk for renal impairment, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA. ATRIPLA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. Pregnancy Category D Efavirenz may cause fetal harm when administered during the first trimester to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving ATRIPLA. Barrier contraception must always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (e.g., oral or other hormonal contraceptives). Because of the long halflife of efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of ATRIPLA is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of ATRIPLA. If this drug is used during the first trimester of pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials of ATRIPLA in pregnant women. ATRIPLA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus, such as in pregnant women without other therapeutic options See Use in Specific Populations (8.1). In controlled clinical trials, 26 (2661008) of subjects treated with 600 mg efavirenz experienced newonset skin rash compared with 17 (111635) of subjects treated in control groups. Rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred in 0.9 (91008) of subjects treated with efavirenz. The incidence of Grade 4 rash (e.g., erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome) in subjects treated with efavirenz in all trials and expanded access was 0.1. Rashes are usually mildtomoderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz (median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days) and, in most subjects continuing therapy with efavirenz, rash resolves within 1 month (median duration, 16 days). The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was 1.7 (171008). ATRIPLA can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or fever. Appropriate antihistamines andor corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. Experience with efavirenz in subjects who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited. Nineteen subjects who discontinued nevirapine because of rash have been treated with efavirenz. Nine of these subjects developed mildtomoderate rash while receiving therapy with efavirenz, and two of these subjects discontinued because of rash. Rash was reported in 26 of 57 pediatric subjects (46) treated with efavirenz See Adverse Reactions (6.1). One pediatric subject experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever), and two subjects had Grade 4 rash (erythema multiforme). The median time to onset of rash in pediatric subjects was 8 days. Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with ATRIPLA in pediatric patients should be considered. Monitoring of liver enzymes before and during treatment is recommended for patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C infection patients with marked transaminase elevations and patients treated with other medications associated with liver toxicity See also Warnings and Precautions (5.2). A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no preexisting hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors See Adverse Reactions (6.3). Liver enzyme monitoring should also be considered for patients without preexisting hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. In patients with persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued therapy with ATRIPLA needs to be weighed against the unknown risks of significant liver toxicity See Adverse Reactions (6.2). Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) should be considered for patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. In a 144week trial of treatmentnaive adult subjects receiving tenofovir DF, decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the trial. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving tenofovir DF  lamivudine  efavirenz compared with subjects receiving stavudine  lamivudine  efavirenz. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 2448 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twentyeight percent of tenofovir DFtreated subjects vs. 21 of the comparator subjects lost at least 5 of BMD at the spine or 7 of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the tenofovir DF group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir DF was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bonespecific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum Ctelopeptide, and urinary Ntelopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. In a clinical trial of HIV1 infected pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older (Study 321), bone effects were similar to adult subjects. Under normal circumstances BMD increases rapidly in this age group. In this trial, the mean rate of bone gain was less in the tenofovir DFtreated group compared to the placebo group. Six tenofovir DFtreated subjects and one placebotreated subject had significant (greater than 4) lumbar spine BMD loss at 48 weeks. Among 28 subjects receiving 96 weeks of tenofovir DF, Zscores declined by 0.341 for lumbar spine and 0.458 for total body. Skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. Markers of bone turnover in tenofovir DFtreated pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older suggest increased bone turnover, consistent with the effects observed in adults. The effects of tenofovir DFassociated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on longterm bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, consult the VIREAD prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF See Adverse Reactions (6.3). Convulsions have been observed in patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of known medical history of seizures. Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medications primarily metabolized by the liver, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels See Drug Interactions (7.3). Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including the components of ATRIPLA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves disease, polymyositis, and GuillainBarr syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistributionaccumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and longterm consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies, rats and mice were given sumatriptan by oral gavage. Mice were dosed for 78 weeks and rats were dosed for 104 weeks. Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose were approximately 110 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single dose of 6 mg. The highest dose to rats was approximately 260 times the maximum single dose of 6 mg on a mgm2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79HGPRT assay). It was not clastogenic in 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility A fertility study (Segment I) by the subcutaneous route, during which male and female rats were dosed daily with sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, has shown no evidence of impaired fertility at doses equivalent to approximately 100 times the maximum recommended single human dose of 6 mg on a mgm2 basis. However, following oral administration, a treatmentrelated decrease in fertility, secondary to a decrease in mating, was seen for rats treated with 50 and 500 mgkgday. The noeffect dose for this finding was approximately 8 times the maximum recommended single human dose of 6 mg on a mgm2 basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with the treatment of males or females or both.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials of sumatriptan injection in pregnant women. Sumatriptan injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. When sumatriptan was administered intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, embryolethality was observed at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. These doses were less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 12 mgday on a mgm2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rabbits during organogenesis was associated with increased incidences of fetal vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest noeffect dose for these effects was 15 mgkgday. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at doses that are approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis, did not produce evidence of embryolethality. The subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats prior to and throughout pregnancy did not produce evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97  16 of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age 24  6 years, weight 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of sumatriptan was (mean  standard deviation) 74  15 ngmL and the time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 12 minutes after injection (range 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a Cmax of 61  15 ngmL by manual injection versus 52  15 ngmL by autoinjector techniques. The Tmax or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ngmL, is low, approximately 14 to 21. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age 33 years, mean weight 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50  8 liters and the distribution halflife was 15  2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6mg subcutaneous dose, 22  4 was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38  7 as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194  149 mLmin and the terminal halflife was 115  19 minutes. Special Populations Age The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age 30 years). Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Hepatic Impairment The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated see Contraindications (4). Race The systemic clearance and Cmax of sumatriptan were similar in black (n  34) and Caucasian (n  38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine OxidaseA Inhibitors In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAOA inhibitor decreased the clearance of sumatriptan, resulting in a 2fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentrationtime curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40 increase in elimination halflife.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 ErgotContaining Drugs Ergotcontaining drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotaminecontaining or ergottype medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine OxidaseA Inhibitors MAOA inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAOA inhibitors is contraindicated see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 7.3 Other 5HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan injection and other 5HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake InhibitorsSerotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, or SNRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors see Warnings and Precautions (5.7).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan injection in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established therefore, sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 singleattack trials, 3 multipleattack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these subjects appeared to be both dose and agedependent, with younger subjects reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, andor intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14yearold male following the use of oral sumatriptan succinate clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Since clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan succinate are not presently available, the use of sumatriptan succinate in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended.</td></tr>

See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in sumatriptan. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking sumatriptan? Before you take sumatriptan, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you have high blood pressure have high cholesterol have diabetes smoke are <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> have heart problems or family history of heart problems or stroke have liver problems have had epilepsy or seizures are not using effective birth control become pregnant while taking sumatriptan are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Sumatriptan passes into your breast milk and may harm your baby. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take sumatriptan. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using sumatriptan with certain other medicines can affect each other, causing serious side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines if you are not sure. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider or pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take sumatriptan? Certain people should take their first dose of sumatriptan in their healthcare providers office or in another medical setting. Ask your healthcare provider if you should take your first dose in a medical setting. Use sumatriptan exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it. Your healthcare provider may change your dose. Do not change your dose without first talking with your healthcare provider. For adults, the usual dose is a single injection given just below the skin. You should give an injection as soon as the symptoms of your headache start, but it may be given at any time during a migraine attack. If you did not get any relief after the first injection, do not give a second injection without first talking with your healthcare provider. You can take a second injection 1 hour after the first injection, but not sooner, if your headache came back after your first injection. Do not take more than 12 mg in a 24hour period. If you use too much sumatriptan, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. You should write down when you have headaches and when you take sumatriptan so you can talk with your healthcare provider about how sumatriptan is working for you. What should I avoid while taking sumatriptan? Sumatriptan can cause dizziness, weakness, or drowsiness. If you have these symptoms, do not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything where you need to be alert. What are the possible side effects of sumatriptan? Sumatriptan may cause serious side effects. See What is the most important information I should know about sumatriptan?

Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious problem that can happen in people using sumatriptan, especially if sumatriptan is used with antidepressant medicines called SSRIs or SNRIs.Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms of serotonin syndrome mental changes such as seeing things that are not there (hallucinations), agitation, or coma fast heartbeat changes in blood pressure high body temperature tight muscles trouble walking seizures. Seizures have happened in people taking sumatriptan who have never had seizures before. Talk with your healthcare provider about your chance of having seizures while you take sumatriptan. The most common side effects of sumatriptan include pain or redness at your injection site tingling or numbness in your fingers or toes dizziness warm, hot, burning feeling to your face (flushing) discomfort or stiffness in your neck feeling weak, drowsy, or tired Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of sumatriptan. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1800FDA1088. How should I store Sumatriptan Injection, USP? Store sumatriptan between 20 to 25C (68 to 77F). Store your medicine away from light.

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 US placebocontrolled clinical trials in migraine subjects Studies 2 and 3, see Clinical Studies (14.1) following either a single 6mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2 or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by at Least 2 of Subjects and at a Greater Frequency Than Placebo in 2 PlaceboControlled Migraine Clinical Trials (Studies 2 and 3)a a The sum of the percentages cited is greater than 100 because subjects may have experienced more than 1 type of adverse reaction.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache Studies 4 and 5, see Clinical Studies (14.2), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan succinate in subjects with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5 sumatriptan succinate, 0 placebo), nausea and vomiting (4 sumatriptan succinate, 0 placebo), and bronchospasm (1 sumatriptan succinate, 0 placebo). Other Adverse Reactions In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse reactions are presented. Reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of subjects reporting a reaction divided by the total number of subjects (N  6,218) exposed to subcutaneous sumatriptan injection. All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions frequent are defined as those occurring in at least 1100 subjects, infrequent are those occurring in 1100 to 11,000 subjects, and rare are those occurring in fewer than 11,000 subjects. Cardiovascular Infrequent were hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, palpitations, and syncope. Rare was arrhythmia. Gastrointestinal Frequent was abdominal discomfort. Musculoskeletal Frequent were muscle cramps. Neurological Frequent was anxiety. Infrequent were mental confusion, euphoria, agitation, tremor. Rare were myoclonia, sleep disturbance, and dystonia. Respiratory Infrequent was dyspnea. Skin Infrequent were erythema, pruritus, and skin rashes. Miscellaneous Infrequent was serotonin agonist effect. Adverse Events Observed With Other Formulations of Sumatriptan Succinate The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan tablets and sumatriptan nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled trials, the role of sumatriptan succinate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Cardiovascular Angina, cerebrovascular lesion, heart block, peripheral cyanosis, phlebitis, thrombosis. Gastrointestinal Abdominal distention and colitis. Neurological Convulsions, hallucinations, syncope, suicide, and twitching. Miscellaneous Edema, hypersensitivity, swelling of extremities, and swelling of face. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan succinate or a combination of these factors. Blood Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Ear, Nose, and Throat Deafness. Eye Ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal artery occlusion, retinal vein thrombosis. Neurological Central nervous system vasculitis, cerebrovascular accident, serotonin syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage. NonSite Specific Angioedema, cyanosis, temporal arteritis.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous use only. (2.1) Acute treatment of migraine 1 to 6mg Single dose. (2.1) Acute treatment of cluster headache 6mg Single dose. (2.1) Maximum dose in a 24hour period 12 mg, Separate doses by at least 1 hour. (2.1) Patients receiving doses other than 6 mg Use the 6mg singledose vial. (2.3) 2.1 Dosing Information The maximum single recommended adult dose of sumatriptan injection for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg injected subcutaneously. For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, lower doses (1 to 5 mg) may be used see Clinical Studies (14.1). For the treatment of cluster headache, the efficacy of lower doses has not been established. The maximum cumulative dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, two 6mg injections separated by at least 1 hour. A second 6mg dose should only be considered if some response to a first injection was observed. 2.2 Administration Using the Sumatriptan Injection Prefilled Syringe Sumatriptan Injection is available for use in 6mg prefilled syringes. The injection is intended to be given subcutaneously, and intramuscular or intravascular delivery must be avoided. Instruct patients on the proper use of sumatriptan injection prefilled syringe and direct them to use injection sites with an adequate skin and subcutaneous thickness to accommodate the length of the needle. 2.3 Administration of Doses of Sumatriptan Succinate Other Than 6 mg In patients receiving doses other than 6 mg, use the 6mg singledose vial do not use the sumatriptan injection prefilled syringe. Visually inspect the vial for particulate matter and discoloration before administration. Do not use if particulates and discolorations are noted.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5HT1B1D receptors. Sumatriptan succinate presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache by binding to 5HT1B1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system. Current theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation andor to the release of sensory neuropeptides (including substance P and calcitonin generelated peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of sumatriptan succinate for the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5HT1B1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of proinflammatory neuropeptide release.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection see Warnings and Precautions (5.1).</td></tr>

Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N  18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some subjects in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptans development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97  16 of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age 24  6 years, weight 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of sumatriptan was (mean  standard deviation) 74  15 ngmL and the time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 12 minutes after injection (range 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a Cmax of 61  15 ngmL by manual injection versus 52  15 ngmL by autoinjector techniques. The Tmax or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ngmL, is low, approximately 14 to 21. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age 33 years, mean weight 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50  8 liters and the distribution halflife was 15  2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6mg subcutaneous dose, 22  4 was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38  7 as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194  149 mLmin and the terminal halflife was 115  19 minutes. Special Populations Age The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age 30 years). Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Hepatic Impairment The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated see Contraindications (4). Race The systemic clearance and Cmax of sumatriptan were similar in black (n  34) and Caucasian (n  38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine OxidaseA Inhibitors In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAOA inhibitor decreased the clearance of sumatriptan, resulting in a 2fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentrationtime curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40 increase in elimination halflife."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Migraine In controlled clinical trials enrolling more than 1,000 subjects during migraine attacks who were experiencing moderate or severe pain and 1 or more of the symptoms enumerated in Table 3, onset of relief began as early as 10 minutes following a 6mg sumatriptan injection. Lower doses of sumatriptan injection may also prove effective, although the proportion of subjects obtaining adequate relief was decreased and the latency to that relief is greater with lower doses. In Study 1, 6 different doses of sumatriptan injection (n  30 each group) were compared with placebo (n  62), in a singleattack, parallelgroup design, the dose response relationship was found to be as shown in Table 2. Table 2. Proportion of Subjects With Migraine Relief and Incidence of Adverse Events by Time and by Sumatriptan Succinate Dose in Study 1 a Relief is defined as the reduction of moderate or severe pain to no or mild pain after dosing without use of rescue medication.

Headache relief, as defined by a reduction in pain from severe or moderately severe to mild or no headache, was achieved in 70 of the subjects within 1 hour of a single 6mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan injection. Approximately 82 and 65 of subjects treated with sumatriptan succinate 6 mg had headache relief and were pain free within 2 hours, respectively. Table 3 shows the 1 and 2hour efficacy results for sumatriptan injection 6 mg in Studies 2 and 3. Table 3.

The efficacy of sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura, duration of attack, gender or age of the subject, or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., betablockers). 14.2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled, 2period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Subjects aged 21 to 65 years were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among subjects receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4).

Figure 1. Time to Relief of Cluster Headache from Time of Injection a a The figure uses KaplanMeier (product limit) Survivorship Plot. Subjects taking rescue medication were censored at 15 minutes. The plot was constructed with data from subjects who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebotreated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection). Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of lateroccurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) Geriatric use A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended in those who have other cardiovascular risk factors prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials of sumatriptan injection in pregnant women. Sumatriptan injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. When sumatriptan was administered intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, embryolethality was observed at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. These doses were less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 12 mgday on a mgm2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rabbits during organogenesis was associated with increased incidences of fetal vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest noeffect dose for these effects was 15 mgkgday. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at doses that are approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis, did not produce evidence of embryolethality. The subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats prior to and throughout pregnancy did not produce evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether sumatriptan is excreted in human breast milk following subcutaneous administration. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from sumatriptan succinate, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan injection in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established therefore, sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 singleattack trials, 3 multipleattack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these subjects appeared to be both dose and agedependent, with younger subjects reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, andor intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14yearold male following the use of oral sumatriptan succinate clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Since clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan succinate are not presently available, the use of sumatriptan succinate in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection see Warnings and Precautions (5.1).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies, rats and mice were given sumatriptan by oral gavage. Mice were dosed for 78 weeks and rats were dosed for 104 weeks. Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose were approximately 110 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single dose of 6 mg. The highest dose to rats was approximately 260 times the maximum single dose of 6 mg on a mgm2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79HGPRT assay). It was not clastogenic in 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay). Impairment of Fertility A fertility study (Segment I) by the subcutaneous route, during which male and female rats were dosed daily with sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, has shown no evidence of impaired fertility at doses equivalent to approximately 100 times the maximum recommended single human dose of 6 mg on a mgm2 basis. However, following oral administration, a treatmentrelated decrease in fertility, secondary to a decrease in mating, was seen for rats treated with 50 and 500 mgkgday. The noeffect dose for this finding was approximately 8 times the maximum recommended single human dose of 6 mg on a mgm2 basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with the treatment of males or females or both. 13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dosage tested, 2 mgkgday, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and noeffect doses were not established however, the relative exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 5 times the human exposure after a 100mg oral dose or 3 times the human exposure after a 6mg subcutaneous dose. Melanin Binding In rats with a single subcutaneous dose (0.5 mgkg) of radiolabeled sumatriptan, the elimination halflife of radioactivity from the eye was 15 days, suggesting that sumatriptan and its metabolites bind to the melanin of the eye. The clinical significance of this binding is unknown.</td></tr>

Coronary vasospasm was observed after intravenous administration of sumatriptan injection see Contraindications (4). Overdoses would be expected from animal data (dogs at 0.1 gkg, rats at 2 gkg) to possibly cause convulsions, tremor, inactivity, erythema of the extremities, reduced respiratory rate, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, injection site reactions (desquamation, hair loss, and scab formation), and paralysis. The elimination halflife of sumatriptan is about 2 hours see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan injection should continue for at least 10 hours or while symptoms or signs persist.

(5.2) Chestthroatneckjaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemia and infarction events, peripheral vasospastic reactions Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs. (5.7) Increase in blood pressure Monitor blood pressure. (5.8) Anaphylacticanaphylactoid reactions Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs (5.9) Seizures Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetals Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5HT1 agonists, including sumatriptan injection, may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetals angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptannaive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent longterm users of sumatriptan injection. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan injection for the presence of CAD or Prinzmetals angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Lifethreatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, andor Jaw PainTightnessPressure As with other 5HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually noncardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetals variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5HT1 agonists, including sumatriptan injection, may cause noncoronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynauds syndrome. Until further evaluation, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of noncoronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5HT1 agonist. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migrainelike daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including sumatriptan injection, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors see Drug Interactions (7.4). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), andor gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 AnaphylacticAnaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylacticanaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with prior serious anaphylactic reaction. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."</td></tr>

CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Longterm continuous administration of estrogen, with and without progestin, in women with and without a uterus, has shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. (See Boxed Warnings , Warnings and Precautions.) Longterm continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver. (See Boxed Warnings , Contraindications, and Warnings sections.) In a 24 month oral carcinogenicity study in mice dosed with 10 mgkgday drospirenone alone or 1  0.01, 3  0.03 and 10  0.1 mgkgday of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol, 0.24 to 10.3 times the exposure (AUC of drospirenone) of women taking a 1 mg dose, there was an increase in carcinomas of the harderian gland in the group that received the high dose of drospirenone alone. In a similar study in rats given 10 mgkgday drospirenone alone or 0.3  0.003, 3  0.03 and 10  0.1 mgkgday drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol, 2.3 to 51.2 times the exposure of women taking a 1 mg dose, there was an increased incidence of benign and total (benign and malignant) adrenal gland pheochromocytomas in the group receiving the high dose of drospirenone. Drospirenone was not mutagenic in a number of in vitro (Ames, Chinese Hamster Lung gene mutation and chromosomal damage in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) genotoxicity tests. Drospirenone increased unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes and formed adducts with rodent liver DNA but not with human liver DNA. (See Warnings section.)</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"Precautions A. GENERAL 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogenalone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Elevated blood pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use. 3. Hypertriglyceridemia In patients with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications. 4. Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. The clearance of drospirenone was decreased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 5. Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroidbinding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 6. Fluid retention Because estrogen and estrogenprogestin therapy may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. 7. Hypocalcemia Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia. 8. Hyponatremia As an aldosterone antagonist, drospirenone may increase the possibility of hyponatremia in highrisk patients. 9. Ovarian cancer The CEMPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average followup of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CEMPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 confidence interval 0.77  3.24) but was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CEMPA versus placebo was 4.2 versus 2.7 cases per 10,000 womenyears. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen alone, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations. 10. Exacerbation of endometriosis Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. 11. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas, and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. PATIENT INFORMATION Physicians are advised to discuss the PATIENT INFORMATION leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe ANGELIQ . C. LABORATORY TESTS Estrogen administration should be initiated at the lowest dose for the approved indication and then guided by clinical response, rather than by serum hormone levels (e.g., estradiol, FSH). D. DRUGLABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time increased platelet count increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII  X complex, II  VII  X complex, and betathromboglobulin decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroidbinding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by proteinbound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Patients on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum (i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormonebinding globulin (SHBG)) leading to increased circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogenrenin substrate, alpha1antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma HDL and HDL2 subfraction concentrations, reduced LDL cholesterol concentration, increased triglyceride levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. Reduced response to metyrapone test. E. CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Longterm continuous administration of estrogen, with and without progestin, in women with and without a uterus, has shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. (See Boxed Warnings , Warnings and Precautions.) Longterm continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver. (See Boxed Warnings , Contraindications, and Warnings sections.) In a 24 month oral carcinogenicity study in mice dosed with 10 mgkgday drospirenone alone or 1  0.01, 3  0.03 and 10  0.1 mgkgday of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol, 0.24 to 10.3 times the exposure (AUC of drospirenone) of women taking a 1 mg dose, there was an increase in carcinomas of the harderian gland in the group that received the high dose of drospirenone alone. In a similar study in rats given 10 mgkgday drospirenone alone or 0.3  0.003, 3  0.03 and 10  0.1 mgkgday drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol, 2.3 to 51.2 times the exposure of women taking a 1 mg dose, there was an increased incidence of benign and total (benign and malignant) adrenal gland pheochromocytomas in the group receiving the high dose of drospirenone. Drospirenone was not mutagenic in a number of in vitro (Ames, Chinese Hamster Lung gene mutation and chromosomal damage in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) genotoxicity tests. Drospirenone increased unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes and formed adducts with rodent liver DNA but not with human liver DNA. (See Warnings section.) F. PREGNANCY ANGELIQ should not be used during pregnancy. (See Contraindications.) G. NURSING MOTHERS Estrogen administration to nursing mothers has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving this drug. Caution should be exercised when ANGELIQ is administered to a nursing woman. After administration of an oral contraceptive containing drospirenone about 0.02 of the drospirenone dose was excreted into the breast milk of postpartum women within 24 hours. This results in a maximal daily dose of about 3 mcg drospirenone in an infant. H. PEDIATRIC USE ANGELIQ is not indicated in children. I. GERIATRIC USE There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients involved in clinical studies utilizing ANGELIQ to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to ANGELIQ . In the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study, including 4,532 women 65 years of age and older, followed for an average of 4 years, 82 (n  3,729) were 65 to 74 while 18 (n  803) were 75 and over. Most women (80) had no prior hormone therapy use. Women treated with conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate were reported to have a twofold increase in the risk of developing probable dementia. Alzheimers disease was the most common classification of probable dementia in both the conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate group and the placebo group. Ninety percent of the cases of probable dementia occurred in the 54 of women who were older than 70. (See Warnings, 3. Dementia.)"</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>"Drug Interactions Effects of Drospirenone on Other Drugs Metabolic Interactions Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies (see Metabolism). In in vitro studies, DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype the daily oral administration of 3mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the systemic clearance of the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole (40 mg) and the CYP2C19 product 5hydroxyomeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrated that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo. Two further clinical drugdrug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4, were each performed in 24 healthy, postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steadystate DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSPday. Based on the available results of in vivo and in vitro studies, it can be concluded that, at clinical dose level, DRSP is unlikely to interact significantly with cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. Johns Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects andor changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects. CoAdministration with Drugs that Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium in women taking drospirenone with other drugs that may affect electrolytes, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Electrolytes were studied in 230 postmenopausal women with hypertension andor diabetes mellitus requiring an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Of these, 26 patients had a creatinine clearance 50 mLmin to 80 mLmin. Patients were given 1 mg estradiol (E2) and 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP) (n112) or placebo (n118) over 28 days. Nondiabetic patients also received ibuprofen 1200 mgday for 5 days during the study. There was a single case of serum potassium 6.0 mEqL and a single case of serum sodium 130 mEqL on treatment, both occurring following five days of ibuprofen therapy in two women taking E2DRSP. Serum potassium levels 5.5 mEqL were observed in 8 (7.3) E2DRSPtreated subjects (3 diabetic and 5 nondiabetic) and in 3 (2.6) placebotreated subjects (2 diabetic and 1 nondiabetic). After 28 days of exposure, the mean change from baseline in serum potassium was 0.11 mEqL for the E2DRSP group and 0.08 mEqL for the placebo group. None of the subjects with serum potassium levels 5.5 mEqL had cardiovascular adverse events. A drugdrug interaction study of DRSP 3 mgestradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium levels were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium levels in the DRSPE2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEqL higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple timepoints over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium Cmax and AUC in the DRSPE2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90 CI 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90 CI 0.944, 1.080), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations 5.5 mEqL). Of note, occasional or chronic use of NSAID medication was not restricted in any of the ANGELIQ clinical trials."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>"Rx only PRESCRIBING INFORMATION Boxed Warnings Estrogens with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. (See WARNINGS, Cardiovascular disorders and Dementia.) The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5 years of treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogens (CE 0.625mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 2.5mg) relative to placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular disorders and Malignant neoplasms, Breast cancer.) The Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, reported increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 5.2 years of treatment with conjugated estrogens alone and during 4 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies, WARNINGS, Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use.) Other doses of oral conjugated estrogens with medroxyprogesterone acetate, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins were not studied in the WHI clinical trials, and, in the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar. Because of these risks, estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>spl_patient_package_insert</i>:</td><td>PATIENT INFORMATION September 2005 ANGELIQ TABLETS (drospirenone and estradiol) (an"ju  le  k) Read this PATIENT INFORMATION before you start taking ANGELIQ and read what you get each time you refill ANGELIQ . There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your health care provider about your medical condition or your treatment. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ANGELIQ (a combination of estrogen and a progestin)? Do not use estrogens with or without progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, or strokes. Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your chances of getting heart attack, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your risk of dementia. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with ANGELIQ . What is ANGELIQ? ANGELIQ is a medicine that contains two kinds of hormones, estrogen and progestin. What is ANGELIQ used for? ANGELIQ is used after menopause to  reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones made by a womans ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause." When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your health care provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with ANGELIQ .  treat moderate to severe dryness, itching, and burning in or around the vagina. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with ANGELIQ to control these problems. If you use ANGELIQ only to treat dryness, itching, and burning in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you. Who should not use ANGELIQ? Do not use ANGELIQ if you have had your uterus removed (hysterectomy). ANGELIQ contains a progestin to decrease the chances of getting cancer of the uterus. If you do not have a uterus, you do not need a progestin and you should not use ANGELIQ . Do not start taking ANGELIQ if you have unusual vaginal bleeding. currently have or have had certain cancers. Estrogens may increase the chances of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or had cancer, talk with your health care provider about whether you should take ANGELIQ . had a stroke or heart attack in the past year. currently have or have had blood clots. have kidney disease, liver disease, or disease of your adrenal glands. are allergic to ANGELIQ or any of its ingredients . See the end of this leaflet for a list of ingredients in ANGELIQ . think you may be pregnant . Tell your health care provider if you are breastfeeding. The hormone in ANGELIQ can pass into your milk. about all of your medical problems. Your health care provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions, such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), migraine, endometriosis, lupus, hypertension (high blood pressure) or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium levels in your blood. about all the medicines you take , including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how ANGELIQ works. ANGELIQ may also affect how your other medicines work. if you are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest. You may need to stop taking estrogens. How should I take ANGELIQ? Take one tablet every day. Estrogens should be used only as long as needed. The lowest effective dose of ANGELIQ has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about whether you still need treatment with ANGELIQ . What are the possible side effects of ANGELIQ? ANGELIQ is different from other hormonal medicines for menopausal symptoms because it contains drospirenone, and drospirenone may increase the potassium or lower the sodium in your blood. You should not take ANGELIQ if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because these conditions may also increase the potassium in your blood. Some other medicines also increase potassium. If you regularly take another medicine that increases potassium levels, talk with your healthcare provider about whether ANGELIQ is right for you. In some situations, your healthcare provider may recommend testing your blood for potassium. Less common but serious side effects include the following and should be discussed with your healthcare provider to assess your personal risks Breast cancer Cancer of the uterus Stroke Heart attack Blood clots Dementia Gallbladder disease Ovarian cancer These are some of the warning signs of serious side effects Breast lumps Unusual vaginal bleeding Dizziness and faintness Changes in speech Severe headaches Chest pain Shortness of breath Pains in your legs Changes in vision Vomiting Call your health care provider right away if you get any of these warning signs, or any other unusual symptom that concerns you. Common side effects include Headache Breast pain Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting Stomachabdominal cramps, bloating Nausea and vomiting Hair loss Other side effects include High blood pressure Liver problems High blood sugar Fluid retention Enlargement of benign tumors of the uterus ("fibroids") Vaginal yeast infection These are not all the possible side effects of ANGELIQ . For more information, ask your health care provider or pharmacist. What can I do to lower my chances of a serious side effect with ANGELIQ? Talk with your health care provider regularly about whether you should continue taking ANGELIQ . See your health care provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking ANGELIQ . Have a breast exam and mammogram (breast Xray) every year unless your health care provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are <b style='color:red'>overweight</b>, or if you use tobacco, you may have higher chances for getting heart disease. Ask your health care provider for ways to lower your chances for getting heart disease. General information about safe and effective use of ANGELIQ.

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>"Warnings ANGELIQ contains 0.5 mg of the progestin drospirenone that has antialdosterone activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in highrisk patients. ANGELIQ should not be used in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (i.e. renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, and adrenal insufficiency). Use caution when prescribing ANGELIQ to women who regularly take other medications that can increase potassium, such as NSAIDs, potassiumsparing diuretics, potassium supplements, ACE inhibitors, angiotensinII receptor antagonists, and heparin. Consider checking serum potassium levels during the first treatment cycle in highrisk patients. See Boxed Warnings . 1. Cardiovascular disorders Estrogen and estrogenprogestin therapy has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (venous thromboembolism or VTE). Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) andor venous thromboembolism (e.g., personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately a. Coronary heart disease and stroke In the Womens Health Initiative study (WHI), an increase in the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes has been observed in women receiving oral CE compared to placebo. (See Clinical Pharmacology, Clinical Studies sections.) In the CEMPA substudy of WHI an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death) was observed in women receiving CEMPA compared to women receiving placebo (37 vs 30 per 10,000 person years). The increase in risk was observed in year one and persisted. In the same substudy of WHI, an increased risk of stroke was observed in women receiving CEMPA compared to women receiving placebo (29 vs 21 per 10,000 personyears). The increase in risk was observed after the first year and persisted. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n  2,763, average age 66.7 years) a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and EstrogenProgestin Replacement Study HERS) treatment with CEMPA0.625mg2.5mg per day demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average followup of 4.1 years, treatment with CEMPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CEMPAtreated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty one women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average followup in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CEMPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis. b. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) In the Womens Health Initiative study (WHI), an increase in VTE has been observed in women receiving CE compared to placebo. (See Clinical Pharmacology and Clinical Studies sections.) In the CEMPA substudy of WHI, a 2fold greater rate of VTE, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, was observed in women receiving CEMPA compared to women receiving placebo. The rate of VTE was 34 per 10,000 womanyears in the CEMPA group compared to 16 per 10,000 womanyears in the placebo group. The increase in VTE risk was observed during the first year and persisted. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant neoplasms a. Endometrial cancer The use of unopposed estrogens in women with intact uteri has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12fold greater than in nonusers, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than one year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15 to 24fold for five to ten years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogenprogestin combinations is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. b. Breast cancer The use of estrogens and progestins by postmenopausal women has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about this issue is the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of CEMPA (see Clinical Pharmacology,Clinical Studies). The results from observational studies are generally consistent with those of the WHI clinical trial and report no significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogens or progestins, doses, or routes of administration. The CEMPA substudy of WHI reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took CEMPA for a mean followup of 5.6 years. Observational studies have also reported an increased risk for estrogenprogestin combination therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen alone therapy, after several years of use. In the WHI trial and from observational studies, the excess risk increased with duration of use. From observational studies, the risk appeared to return to baseline in about five years after stopping treatment. In addition, observational studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogenprogestin combination therapy as compared to estrogen alone therapy. In the CEMPA substudy, 26 of the women reported prior use of estrogen alone andor estrogenprogestin combination hormone therapy. After a mean followup of 5.6 years during the clinical trial, the overall relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 (95 confidence interval 1.01  1.54), and the overall absolute risk was 41 vs. 33 cases per 10,000 womenyears, for CEMPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 vs. 25 cases per 10,000 womenyears, for CEMPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 vs. 36 cases per 10,000 womenyears for CEMPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CEMPA group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast selfexaminations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, and risk factors, and prior mammogram results. 3. Dementia In the estrogen alone Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, 2,947 hysterectomized women aged 65 to 79 years were randomized to CE or placebo. In the estrogen plus progestin WHIMS substudy, 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years were randomized to CEMPA or placebo. In the estrogen alone substudy, after an average followup of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for estrogen alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 CI 0.83  2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for estrogen alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 womenyears. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See Clinical Pharmacology, Clinical Studies and Precautions, I. GERIATRIC USE .) After an average followup of 4 years, 40 women being treated with CEMPA (1.8, n  2,229) and 21 women in the placebo group (0.9, n  2,303) received diagnoses of probable dementia. The relative risk for CEMPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 confidence interval 1.21  3.48), and was similar for women with and without histories of menopausal hormone use before WHIMS. The absolute risk of proba ble dementia for CEMPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 womenyears, and the absolute excess risk for CEMPA was 23 cases per 10,000 womenyears. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See Clinical Pharmacology, Clinical Studies and Precautions, I. GERIATRIC USE .) 4. Gallbladder disease A 2 to 4fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5. Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level. 6. Visual abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>A. GENERAL 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogenalone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Elevated blood pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use. 3. Hypertriglyceridemia In patients with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications. 4. Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. The clearance of drospirenone was decreased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 5. Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroidbinding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 6. Fluid retention Because estrogen and estrogenprogestin therapy may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. 7. Hypocalcemia Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia. 8. Hyponatremia As an aldosterone antagonist, drospirenone may increase the possibility of hyponatremia in highrisk patients. 9. Ovarian cancer The CEMPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average followup of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CEMPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 confidence interval 0.77  3.24) but was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CEMPA versus placebo was 4.2 versus 2.7 cases per 10,000 womenyears. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen alone, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations. 10. Exacerbation of endometriosis Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. 11. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas, and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>Dosage and Administration The dosage of ANGELIQ is one tablet daily. Women who are already using a product containing estrogen should stop taking that product before starting ANGELIQ . Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be limited to the lowest effective dose available and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3month to 6month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see Boxed Warnings and Warnings sections). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

GERIATRIC USE There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients involved in clinical studies utilizing ANGELIQ to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to ANGELIQ . In the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study, including 4,532 women 65 years of age and older, followed for an average of 4 years, 82 (n  3,729) were 65 to 74 while 18 (n  803) were 75 and over. Most women (80) had no prior hormone therapy use. Women treated with conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate were reported to have a twofold increase in the risk of developing probable dementia. Alzheimers disease was the most common classification of probable dementia in both the conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate group and the placebo group. Ninety percent of the cases of probable dementia occurred in the 54 of women who were older than 70. (See Warnings, 3. Dementia.)"</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>Clinical Pharmacology Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol (E2) is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfateconjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogenresponsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These will vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Drospirenone (DRSP) is a synthetic progestin and spironolactone analog with antimineralocorticoid activity. In animals and in vitro, drospirenone has antiandrogenic activity, but no glucocorticoid, antiglucocorticoid, estrogenic, or androgenic activity. Progestins counter estrogenic effects by decreasing the number of nuclear estradiol receptors and suppressing epithelial DNA synthesis in endometrial tissue. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Serum concentrations of DRSP reach peak levels approximately 1 hour after administration of ANGELIQ and mean absolute bioavailability of DRSP ranges from 7685. Following oral administration, peak serum estradiol concentrations are typically reached 68 hours after dosing with ANGELI Q. The oral relative bioavailability of estradiol and DRSP following administration of ANGELIQ is 107 and 102, respectively when compared to a combination oral suspension. The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional within the dose range of 0.54 mg. Following daily dosing of ANGELIQ , steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 10 days. Mean accumulation ratios for estradiol and DRSP were 1.9 and 2.4, respectively. Mean concentrations at 2 hours for DRSP ranged between 5.9 and 6.7 ngmL after treatment with ANGELIQ for 365 days. Mean steady state serum DRSP and E2 concentrations are shown in Figure 1, and a summary of primary pharmacokinetic parameters following the administration of 1mg E21mg DRSP for 28 days is presented in Table 1.

However, clinical studies with different formulations containing DRSP or E2 have shown that the bioavailability of both drugs is not affected by concomitant food intake. Distribution The mean volume of distribution of DRSP is 4.2 Lkg. DRSP does not bind to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97 to other serum proteins. The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estradiol circulates in the blood bound to SHBG (37) and to albumin (61), while only approximately 1  2 is unbound. Metabolism Mean clearance of DRSP is 1.2 mLminkg. DRSP is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The 2 main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5dihydrodrospirenone3sulfate, both of which are formed without the involvement of the cytochrome P450 system. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. In in vitro studies with human liver microsomes, DRSP was metabolized only to a minor extent mainly by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the gut followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. Excretion DRSP serum levels are characterized by a terminal elimination half  life of approximately 36  42 hours. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after 10 days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38 to 47 of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17 to 20 of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates. Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Special Populations Geriatric No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in the geriatric population. Pediatric No pharmacokinetic study for ANGELIQ has been conducted in a pediatric population. Gender ANGELIQ is indicated for use in women only. Race No studies were done to determine the effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of ANGELIQ . Patients with Hepatic Impairment ANGELIQ is contraindicated in patients with hepatic dysfunction (also see BOLDED Warnings). The mean exposure to DRSP in women with moderate liver impairment is approximately three times the exposure in women with normal liver function. Patients with Renal Impairment ANGELIQ is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency (also see BOLDED Warnings). The effect of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effects of DRSP on serum potassium levels were investigated in female subjects (n  28, age 30  65) with normal renal function (11 patients), and mild (10 patients) and moderate (7 patients) renal impairment. All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study 7 subjects continued the use of potassiumsparing drugs for the treatment of the underlying illness. On the 14th day (steadystate) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP levels were on average 37 higher in the group with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30  50 mLmin) compared to those in the group with normal renal function. Serum DRSP levels in the group with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance CLcr, 50  80 mLmin) were comparable to those in the group with normal renal function (CLcr, 80 mLmin). DRSP treatment was well tolerated by all groups. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in 5 of the 7 subjects who continued use of potassium sparing drugs during the study, individual mean serum potassium levels increased by up to 0.33 mEqL. Therefore, potential exists for hyperkalemia to occur in subjects with renal impairment whose serum potassium is in the upper reference range, and who are concomitantly using potassium sparing drugs. Drug Interactions Effects of Drospirenone on Other Drugs Metabolic Interactions Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies (see Metabolism). In in vitro studies, DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype the daily oral administration of 3mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the systemic clearance of the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole (40 mg) and the CYP2C19 product 5hydroxyomeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrated that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo. Two further clinical drugdrug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4, were each performed in 24 healthy, postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steadystate DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSPday. Based on the available results of in vivo and in vitro studies, it can be concluded that, at clinical dose level, DRSP is unlikely to interact significantly with cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. Johns Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects andor changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects. CoAdministration with Drugs that Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium in women taking drospirenone with other drugs that may affect electrolytes, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Electrolytes were studied in 230 postmenopausal women with hypertension andor diabetes mellitus requiring an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Of these, 26 patients had a creatinine clearance 50 mLmin to 80 mLmin. Patients were given 1 mg estradiol (E2) and 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP) (n112) or placebo (n118) over 28 days. Nondiabetic patients also received ibuprofen 1200 mgday for 5 days during the study. There was a single case of serum potassium 6.0 mEqL and a single case of serum sodium 130 mEqL on treatment, both occurring following five days of ibuprofen therapy in two women taking E2DRSP. Serum potassium levels 5.5 mEqL were observed in 8 (7.3) E2DRSPtreated subjects (3 diabetic and 5 nondiabetic) and in 3 (2.6) placebotreated subjects (2 diabetic and 1 nondiabetic). After 28 days of exposure, the mean change from baseline in serum potassium was 0.11 mEqL for the E2DRSP group and 0.08 mEqL for the placebo group. None of the subjects with serum potassium levels 5.5 mEqL had cardiovascular adverse events. A drugdrug interaction study of DRSP 3 mgestradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium levels were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium levels in the DRSPE2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEqL higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple timepoints over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium Cmax and AUC in the DRSPE2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90 CI 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90 CI 0.944, 1.080), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations 5.5 mEqL). Of note, occasional or chronic use of NSAID medication was not restricted in any of the ANGELIQ clinical trials. Clinical Studies Support for the indications Support for treatment of vasomotor symptoms and vaginal and vulvar atrophy was shown through bioequivalence of the E2 component of the combination product with a currently marketed E2 product (Estrace). The multipledose bioequivalence study evaluated the bioequivalence of E2 from a tablet containing DRSP (2 mg) and E2 (1 mg) relative to Estrace (1 mg) tablet. DRSPE2 tablets met the criteria for bioequivalence to Estrace. Effects on Endometrium In a one year clinical trial of 1,142 postmenopausal subjects treated with E2 alone or E2  0.5, 1, 2, or 3 mg DRSP, endometrial biopsies were performed on 966 (84.6) subjects during the treatment period. Eight subjects in the E2 monotherapy group developed endometrial hyperplasia (4 simple hyperplasia with no cytological atypia, 3 complex hyperplasia with no cytological atypia, and 1 complex hyperplasia with cytological atypia), and one subject in the 1 mg E2  2 mg DRSP group developed simple hyperplasia with no cytological atypia. Table 2 shows that there were no diagnoses of endometrial hyperplasia in the ANGELIQ group.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome studied. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. The study did not evaluate the effects of CE or CEMPA on menopausal symptoms. The CEMPA substudy was stopped early because, according to the predefined stopping rule, the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index".

Womens Health Initiative Memory Study The Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 were age 65 to 69 years, 35 were 70 to 74 years, and 18 were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of CEMPA (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared with placebo. After an average followup of 4 years, 40 women in the estrogenprogestin (45 per 10,000 womenyears) and 21 in the placebo group (22 per 10,000 womenyears) were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia in the hormone therapy group was 2.05 (95 CI, 1.21 to 3.48) compared to placebo. Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See Boxed Warnings and Warnings, 3. Dementia.) Figure 1 Figure 2</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>"Boxed Warnings Estrogens with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. (See WARNINGS, Cardiovascular disorders and Dementia.) The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5 years of treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogens (CE 0.625mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 2.5mg) relative to placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular disorders and Malignant neoplasms, Breast cancer.) The Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, reported increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 5.2 years of treatment with conjugated estrogens alone and during 4 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies, WARNINGS, Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use.) Other doses of oral conjugated estrogens with medroxyprogesterone acetate, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins were not studied in the WHI clinical trials, and, in the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar. Because of these risks, estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.", WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ANGELIQ (a combination of estrogen and a progestin)? Do not use estrogens with or without progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, or strokes. Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your chances of getting heart attack, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your risk of dementia. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with ANGELIQ .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Abacavir was administered orally at 3 dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2year carcinogenicity studies. Results showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and nonmalignant tumors. Malignant tumors occurred in the preputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species, and in the liver of female rats. In addition, nonmalignant tumors also occurred in the liver and thyroid gland of female rats. These observations were made at systemic exposures in the range of 6 to 32 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. It is not known how predictive the results of rodent carcinogenicity studies may be for humans. Mutagenicity Abacavir induced chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human lymphocytes. Abacavir was mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation, although it was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay. Abacavir was clastogenic in males and not clastogenic in females in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. Abacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity assays in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility Abacavir had no adverse effects on the mating performance or fertility of male and female rats at a dose approximately 8 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on body surface area comparisons.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) and developmental toxicity (depressed fetal body weight and reduced crownrump length) were observed in rats at a dose which produced 35 times the human exposure based on AUC. Embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) and toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at half of the abovementioned dose in separate fertility studies conducted in rats. In the rabbit, no developmental toxicity and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at doses that produced 8.5 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Abacavir sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risk. Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry To monitor maternalfetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to abacavir sulfate, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 18002584263.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>"12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics in Adults The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have been studied in asymptomatic, HIV1infected adult subjects after administration of a single intravenous (IV) dose of 150 mg and after single and multiple oral doses. The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were independent of dose over the range of 300 to 1,200 mgday. Absorption and Bioavailability Abacavir was rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral administration. The geometric mean absolute bioavailability of the tablet was 83. After oral administration of 300 mg twice daily in 20 subjects, the steadystate peak serum abacavir concentration (Cmax) was 3  0.89 mcgmL (mean  SD) and AUC(012 hr) was 6.02  1.73 mcghrmL. After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects, Cmax was 4.26  1.19 mcgmL (mean  SD) and AUC was 11.95  2.51 mcghrmL. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of abacavir was 0.86  0.15 Lkg, suggesting that abacavir distributes into extravascular space. In 3 subjects, the CSF AUC(06 hr) to plasma abacavir AUC(06 hr) ratio ranged from 27 to 33. Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50. Binding of abacavir to plasma proteins was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drugrelated radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes. Metabolism In humans, abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase (to form the 5carboxylic acid) and glucuronyl transferase (to form the 5glucuronide). The metabolites do not have antiviral activity. In vitro experiments reveal that abacavir does not inhibit human CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations. Elimination Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600 mg dose of 14Cabacavir 99 of the radioactivity was recovered, 1.2 was excreted in the urine as abacavir, 30 as the 5carboxylic acid metabolite, 36 as the 5glucuronide metabolite, and 15 as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16 of the dose. In singledose trials, the observed elimination halflife (t12) was 1.54  0.63 hours. After intravenous administration, total clearance was 0.8  0.24 Lhrkg (mean  SD). Effects of Food on Oral Absorption Bioavailability of abacavir tablets was assessed in the fasting and fed states. There was no significant difference in systemic exposure (AUC) in the fed and fasting states therefore, abacavir sulfate tablets may be administered with or without food. Systemic exposure to abacavir was comparable after administration of abacavir sulfate oral solution and abacavir sulfate tablets. Therefore, these products may be used interchangeably. Special Populations Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir sulfate have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function. Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (ChildPugh score 5 to 6). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89 in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58 in the halflife of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased. A dose of 200 mg (provided by 10 mL of abacavir sulfate oral solution) administered twice daily is recommended for patients with mild liver disease. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of abacavir have not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment therefore abacavir sulfate is contraindicated in these patients. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied after either single or repeat doses of abacavir sulfate in 68 pediatric patients. Following multipledose administration of abacavir sulfate 8 mgkg twice daily, steadystate AUC(012 hr) and Cmax were 9.8  4.56 mcghrmL and 3.71  1.36 mcgmL (mean  SD), respectively see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). In addition, to support dosing of abacavir sulfate scored tablet (300 mg) for pediatric patients 14 kg to greater than 30 kg, analysis of actual and simulated pharmacokinetic data indicated comparable exposures are expected following administration of 300 mg scored tablet and the 8 mgkg dosing regimen using oral solution. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of abacavir sulfate have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age. Gender A population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV1infected male (n  304) and female (n  67) subjects showed no gender differences in abacavir AUC normalized for lean body weight. Race There are no significant differences between blacks and Caucasians in abacavir pharmacokinetics. Drug Interactions In human liver microsomes, abacavir did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoforms (2C9, 2D6, 3A4). Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur between abacavir and drugs metabolized through these pathways. Lamivudine andor Zidovudine Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and zidovudine via glucuronyl transferase, 15 HIV1infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir. Ethanol Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and ethanol via alcohol dehydrogenase, the pharmacokinetic interaction between abacavir and ethanol was studied in 24 HIV1infected male subjects. Each subject received the following treatments on separate occasions a single 600 mg dose of abacavir, 0.7 gkg ethanol (equivalent to 5 alcoholic drinks), and abacavir 600 mg plus 0.7 gkg ethanol. Coadministration of ethanol and abacavir resulted in a 41 increase in abacavir AUC and a 26 increase in abacavir t12. In males, abacavir had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol, so no clinically significant interaction is expected in men. This interaction has not been studied in females. Methadone In a trial of 11 HIV1infected subjects receiving methadonemaintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of abacavir sulfate twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22 (90 CI 6 to 42). This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. The addition of methadone had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>spl_medguide</i>:</td><td>MEDICATION GUIDE Abacavir Tablets USP Read this Medication Guide before you start taking abacavir tablets and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Be sure to carry your abacavir tablets Warning Card with you at all times. What is the most important information I should know about abacavir tablets? 1. Serious allergic reaction (hypersensitivity reaction). Abacavir tablets contain abacavir (also contained in EPZICOMand TRIZIVIR). Patients taking abacavir tablets may have a serious allergic reaction (hypersensitivity reaction) that can cause death. Your risk of this allergic reaction is much higher if you have a gene variation called HLAB5701. Your healthcare provider can determine with a blood test if you have this gene variation. If you get a symptom from 2 or more of the following groups while taking abacavir tablets, call your healthcare provider right away to find out if you should stop taking abacavir tablets. Symptom(s) Group 1 Fever Group 2 Rash Group 3 Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal (stomach area) pain Group 4 Generally ill feeling, extreme tiredness, or achiness Group 5 Shortness of breath, cough, sore throat A list of these symptoms is on the Warning Card your pharmacist gives you. Carry this Warning Card with you at all times. If you stop abacavir tablets because of an allergic reaction, never take abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining medicine (EPZICOM and TRIZIVIR) again. If you take abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining medicine again after you have had an allergic reaction, within hours you may get lifethreatening symptoms that may include very low blood pressure or death. If you stop abacavir tablets for any other reason, even for a few days, and you are not allergic to abacavir tablets, talk with your healthcare provider before taking them again. Taking abacavir tablets again can cause a serious allergic or lifethreatening reaction, even if you never had an allergic reaction to them before. If your healthcare provider tells you that you can take abacavir tablets again, start taking them when you are around medical help or people who can call a healthcare provider if you need one. 2. Lactic Acidosis (buildup of acid in the blood). Some human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medicines, including abacavir tablets, can cause a rare but serious condition called lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a serious medical emergency that can cause death and must be treated in the hospital. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of lactic acidosis you feel very weak or tired you have unusual (not normal) muscle pain you have trouble breathing you have stomach pain with nausea and vomiting you feel cold, especially in your arms and legs you feel dizzy or lightheaded you have a fast or irregular heartbeat 3. Serious liver problems. Some people who have taken medicines like abacavir tablets have developed serious liver problems called hepatotoxicity, with liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and fat in the liver (steatosis). Hepatomegaly with steatosis is a serious medical emergency that can cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of liver problems your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice) your urine turns dark your bowel movements (stools) turn light in color you dont feel like eating food for several days or longer you feel sick to your stomach (nausea) you have lower stomach area (abdominal) pain You may be more likely to get lactic acidosis or serious liver problems if you are female, very <b style='color:red'>overweight</b>, or have been taking nucleoside analogue medicines for a long time. What are abacavir tablets? Abacavir tablets are a prescription medicine used to treat HIV infection. Abacavir tablets are a medicine called a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Abacavir tablets are always used with other antiHIV medicines. When used in combination with these other medicines, abacavir tablets help lower the amount of HIV in your blood.  Abacavir tablets do not cure HIV infection or AIDS. It is not known if abacavir tablets will help you live longer or have fewer of the medical problems that people get with HIV or AIDS. It is very important that you see your doctor regularly while you are taking abacavir tablets. Who should not take abacavir tablets? Do not take abacavir tablets if you  are allergic to abacavir or any of the ingredients in abacavir tablets. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in abacavir tablets.  have certain liver problems. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking abacavir tablets? Before you take abacavir tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you  have been tested and know whether or not you have a particular gene variation called HLAB5701.  have hepatitis B virus infection or have other liver problems.  have heart problems, smoke, or have diseases that increase your risk of heart disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.  are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if abacavir tablets will harm your unborn baby. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.  Pregnancy Registry. If you take abacavir tablets while you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about how you can take part in the Pregnancy Registry for abacavir tablets. The purpose of the pregnancy registry is to collect information about the health of you and your baby.  are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Do not breastfeed. We do not know if abacavir sulfate can be passed to your baby in your breast milk and whether it could harm your baby. Also, mothers with HIV1 should not breastfeed because HIV1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk.  Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take alcohol methadone TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you take one of the medicines listed above. Abacavir tablets may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how abacavir tablets work. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines with you to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take abacavir tablets?  Take abacavir tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take them.  Abacavir tablets are taken by mouth as a tablet or a strawberry and bananaflavored liquid. Abacavir tablets may be taken with or without food. Do not skip doses. Children aged 3 months and older can also take abacavir tablets. The childs healthcare provider will decide the right dose and whether the child should take the tablet or liquid, based on the childs weight. The dose should not be more than the recommended adult dose.  Do not let your abacavir tablets run out. If you stop your antiHIV medicines, even for a short time, the amount of virus in your blood may increase and the virus may become harder to treat. If you take too much abacavir sulfate, call your healthcare provider or poison control center or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. What are the possible side effects of abacavir tablets?  Abacavir tablets can cause serious side effects including allergic reactions, lactic acidosis, and liver problems. See What is the most important information I should know about abacavir tablets?  Changes in immune system (Immune Reconstitution Syndrome). Your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. Tell your healthcare provider if you start having new or worse symptoms of infection after you start taking abacavir tablets.  Changes in body fat (fat redistribution). Changes in body fat (lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy) can happen in some people taking antiretroviral medicines including abacavir tablets. These changes may include more fat in or around your trunk, upper back and neck (buffalo hump), breast, or chest loss of fat in your legs, arms, or face  Heart attack (myocardial infarction). Some HIV medicines including abacavir tablets may increase your risk of heart attack. The most common side effects of abacavir tablets in adults include bad dreams or sleep problems nausea headache tiredness vomiting The most common side effects of abacavir tablets in children include fever and chills nausea vomiting rash ear, nose, or throat infections Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of abacavir tablets. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1800FDA1088. How should I store abacavir tablets? Store abacavir tablets at room temperature, between 20 to 25C (68 to 77F). Do not freeze abacavir tablets.  Keep abacavir tablets and all medicines out of the reach of children. General information for safe and effective use of abacavir tablets Avoid doing things that can spread HIV infection to others.  Do not share needles or other injection equipment.  Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades.  Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safe sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Medication Guide. Do not use abacavir tablets for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give abacavir tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. They may harm them.

For hypersensitivity reactions, subjects receiving abacavir sulfate once daily showed a rate of 9 in comparison with a rate of 7 for subjects receiving abacavir sulfate twice daily. However, subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily, experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5) of subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2 of subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2) of subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily had this event. Laboratory Abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3 to 4) in therapynaive adults during therapy with abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 4.

Mild elevations of blood glucose were more frequent in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir sulfate (CNA3006) as compared with adult subjects (CNA30024). Other Adverse Events In addition to adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, other adverse reactions observed in the expanded access program were pancreatitis and increased GGT. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of abacavir sulfate. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to abacavir sulfate. Body as a Whole Redistributionaccumulation of body fat. Cardiovascular Myocardial infarction. Hepatic Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis. Skin Suspected StevensJohnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use.</td></tr>

(The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.) to carry the Warning Card with them. how to identify a hypersensitivity reaction see Medication Guide. that if they develop symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction they should call their doctor right away to determine if they should stop taking abacavir sulfate. that a hypersensitivity reaction can worsen and lead to hospitalization or death if abacavir sulfate is not immediately discontinued. that in one trial, more severe hypersensitivity reactions were seen when abacavir sulfate was dosed 600 mg once daily. to not restart abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining product following a hypersensitivity reaction because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include lifethreatening hypotension and death. that a hypersensitivity reaction is usually reversible if it is detected promptly and abacavir sulfate is stopped right away. that if they have interrupted abacavir sulfate for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity (for example, those who have an interruption in drug supply), a serious or fatal hypersensitivity reaction may occur with reintroduction of abacavir. to not restart abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining product without medical consultation and that restarting abacavir needs to be undertaken only if medical care can be readily accessed by the patient or others. abacavir sulfate should not be coadministered with EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets or TRIZIVIR(abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets. Lactic AcidosisHepatomegaly Inform patients that some HIV medicines, including abacavir sulfate, can cause a rare, but serious condition called lactic acidosis with liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2). RedistributionAccumulation of Body Fat Inform patients that redistribution or accumulation of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy and that the cause and longterm health effects of these conditions are not known at this time see Warnings and Precautions (5.4). Information About HIV1 Infection Abacavir sulfate is not a cure for HIV1 infection and patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with HIV1 infection, including opportunistic infections. Patients should remain under the care of a physician when using abacavir sulfate. Patients should be advised to avoid doing things that can spread HIV1 infection to others.  Do not share needles or other injection equipment.  Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades.  Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safe sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood.  Do not breastfeed. We do not know if abacavir sulfate can be passed to your baby in your breast milk and whether it could harm your baby. Also, mothers with HIV1 should not breastfeed because HIV1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk. Patients should be informed to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed.

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION Abacavir sulfate is a synthetic carbocyclic nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against HIV1. The chemical name of abacavir sulfate is (1S,cis)42amino6(cyclopropylamino)9Hpurin9yl2cyclopentene1methanol sulfate (salt) (21). Abacavir sulfate is the enantiomer with 1S, 4R absolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring. It has a molecular formula of (C14H18N6O)2H2SO4 and a molecular weight of 670.76 daltons. It has the following structural formula Abacavir sulfate USP is a white to offwhite solid with a solubility of approximately 77 mgmL in distilled water at 25C. It has an octanolwater (pH 7.1 to 7.3) partition coefficient (log P) of approximately 1.2 at 25C. Abacavir tablets USP are for oral administration. Each tablet contains abacavir sulfate USP equivalent to 300 mg of abacavir as active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate. The tablets are coated with a film that is made of hypromellose, iron oxide yellow, polysorbate 80, titanium dioxide, and triacetin. In vivo, abacavir sulfate dissociates to its free base, abacavir. All dosages for abacavir sulfate are expressed in terms of abacavir. Chemical Structure</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Abacavir is an antiviral agent See Clinical Pharmacology (12.4). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics in Adults The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have been studied in asymptomatic, HIV1infected adult subjects after administration of a single intravenous (IV) dose of 150 mg and after single and multiple oral doses. The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were independent of dose over the range of 300 to 1,200 mgday. Absorption and Bioavailability Abacavir was rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral administration. The geometric mean absolute bioavailability of the tablet was 83. After oral administration of 300 mg twice daily in 20 subjects, the steadystate peak serum abacavir concentration (Cmax) was 3  0.89 mcgmL (mean  SD) and AUC(012 hr) was 6.02  1.73 mcghrmL. After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects, Cmax was 4.26  1.19 mcgmL (mean  SD) and AUC was 11.95  2.51 mcghrmL. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of abacavir was 0.86  0.15 Lkg, suggesting that abacavir distributes into extravascular space. In 3 subjects, the CSF AUC(06 hr) to plasma abacavir AUC(06 hr) ratio ranged from 27 to 33. Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50. Binding of abacavir to plasma proteins was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drugrelated radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes. Metabolism In humans, abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase (to form the 5carboxylic acid) and glucuronyl transferase (to form the 5glucuronide). The metabolites do not have antiviral activity. In vitro experiments reveal that abacavir does not inhibit human CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations. Elimination Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600 mg dose of 14Cabacavir 99 of the radioactivity was recovered, 1.2 was excreted in the urine as abacavir, 30 as the 5carboxylic acid metabolite, 36 as the 5glucuronide metabolite, and 15 as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16 of the dose. In singledose trials, the observed elimination halflife (t12) was 1.54  0.63 hours. After intravenous administration, total clearance was 0.8  0.24 Lhrkg (mean  SD). Effects of Food on Oral Absorption Bioavailability of abacavir tablets was assessed in the fasting and fed states. There was no significant difference in systemic exposure (AUC) in the fed and fasting states therefore, abacavir sulfate tablets may be administered with or without food. Systemic exposure to abacavir was comparable after administration of abacavir sulfate oral solution and abacavir sulfate tablets. Therefore, these products may be used interchangeably. Special Populations Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir sulfate have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function. Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (ChildPugh score 5 to 6). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89 in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58 in the halflife of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased. A dose of 200 mg (provided by 10 mL of abacavir sulfate oral solution) administered twice daily is recommended for patients with mild liver disease. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of abacavir have not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment therefore abacavir sulfate is contraindicated in these patients. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied after either single or repeat doses of abacavir sulfate in 68 pediatric patients. Following multipledose administration of abacavir sulfate 8 mgkg twice daily, steadystate AUC(012 hr) and Cmax were 9.8  4.56 mcghrmL and 3.71  1.36 mcgmL (mean  SD), respectively see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). In addition, to support dosing of abacavir sulfate scored tablet (300 mg) for pediatric patients 14 kg to greater than 30 kg, analysis of actual and simulated pharmacokinetic data indicated comparable exposures are expected following administration of 300 mg scored tablet and the 8 mgkg dosing regimen using oral solution. Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of abacavir sulfate have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age. Gender A population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV1infected male (n  304) and female (n  67) subjects showed no gender differences in abacavir AUC normalized for lean body weight. Race There are no significant differences between blacks and Caucasians in abacavir pharmacokinetics. Drug Interactions In human liver microsomes, abacavir did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoforms (2C9, 2D6, 3A4). Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur between abacavir and drugs metabolized through these pathways. Lamivudine andor Zidovudine Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and zidovudine via glucuronyl transferase, 15 HIV1infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir. Ethanol Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and ethanol via alcohol dehydrogenase, the pharmacokinetic interaction between abacavir and ethanol was studied in 24 HIV1infected male subjects. Each subject received the following treatments on separate occasions a single 600 mg dose of abacavir, 0.7 gkg ethanol (equivalent to 5 alcoholic drinks), and abacavir 600 mg plus 0.7 gkg ethanol. Coadministration of ethanol and abacavir resulted in a 41 increase in abacavir AUC and a 26 increase in abacavir t12. In males, abacavir had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol, so no clinically significant interaction is expected in men. This interaction has not been studied in females. Methadone In a trial of 11 HIV1infected subjects receiving methadonemaintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of abacavir sulfate twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22 (90 CI 6 to 42). This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. The addition of methadone had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir. 12.4 Microbiology Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBVTP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine5triphosphate (dGTP). CBVTP inhibits the activity of HIV1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA. The lack of a 3OH group in the incorporated nucleotide analogue prevents the formation of the 5 to 3 phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated. CBVTP is a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases , , and . Antiviral Activity The antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV1 was evaluated against a Tcell tropic laboratory strain HIV1IIIB in lymphoblastic cell lines, a monocytemacrophage tropic laboratory strain HIV1BaL in primary monocytesmacrophages, and clinical isolates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The concentration of drug necessary to effect viral replication by 50 percent (EC50) ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 M (1 M  0.28 mcgmL) and 0.07 to 1 M against HIV1IIIB and HIV1BaL, respectively, and was 0.26  0.18 M against 8 clinical isolates. The EC50 values of abacavir against different HIV1 clades (AG) ranged from 0.0015 to 1.05 M, and against HIV2 isolates, from 0.024 to 0.49 M. Abacavir had synergistic activity in cell culture in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine, the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine, and the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir and additive activity in combination with the NRTIs didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine. Ribavirin (50 M) had no effect on the antiHIV1 activity of abacavir in cell culture. Resistance HIV1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to abacavir have been selected in cell culture and were also obtained from subjects treated with abacavir. Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavirtreated subjects demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184VI in RT contributed to abacavir resistance. In a trial of therapynaive adults receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily (n  384) or 300 mg twice daily (n  386), in a background regimen of lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily (CNA30021), the incidence of virologic failure at 48 weeks was similar between the 2 groups (11 in both arms). Genotypic (n  38) and phenotypic analyses (n  35) of virologic failure isolates from this trial showed that the RT substitutions that emerged during abacavir oncedaily and twicedaily therapy were K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184VI. The substitution M184VI was the most commonly observed substitution in virologic failure isolates from subjects receiving abacavir once daily (56, 1018) and twice daily (40, 820). Thirtynine percent (718) of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir oncedaily arm had a greater than 2.5fold decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a medianfold decrease of 1.3 (range 0.5 to 11) compared with 29 (517) of the failure isolates in the twicedaily arm with a medianfold decrease of 0.92 (range 0.7 to 13). CrossResistance Crossresistance has been observed among NRTIs. Isolates containing abacavir resistanceassociated substitutions, namely, K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V, exhibited crossresistance to didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine in cell culture and in subjects. The K65R substitution can confer resistance to abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine the L74V substitution can confer resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and zalcitabine and the M184V substitution can confer resistance to abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and zalcitabine. An increasing number of thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215YF, K219ERHQN) is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) and developmental toxicity (depressed fetal body weight and reduced crownrump length) were observed in rats at a dose which produced 35 times the human exposure based on AUC. Embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) and toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at half of the abovementioned dose in separate fertility studies conducted in rats. In the rabbit, no developmental toxicity and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at doses that produced 8.5 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Abacavir sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risk. Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry To monitor maternalfetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to abacavir sulfate, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 18002584263. 8.3 Nursing Mothers The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV1infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV1 infection. Although it is not known if abacavir is excreted in human milk, abacavir is secreted into the milk of lactating rats. Because of both the potential for HIV1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir sulfate. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of abacavir sulfate have been established in pediatric patients 3 months to 13 years of age. Use of abacavir sulfate in these agegroups is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and wellcontrolled trials of abacavir sulfate in adults and pediatric patients see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of abacavir sulfate did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Abacavir was administered orally at 3 dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2year carcinogenicity studies. Results showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and nonmalignant tumors. Malignant tumors occurred in the preputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species, and in the liver of female rats. In addition, nonmalignant tumors also occurred in the liver and thyroid gland of female rats. These observations were made at systemic exposures in the range of 6 to 32 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. It is not known how predictive the results of rodent carcinogenicity studies may be for humans. Mutagenicity Abacavir induced chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human lymphocytes. Abacavir was mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation, although it was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay. Abacavir was clastogenic in males and not clastogenic in females in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. Abacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity assays in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility Abacavir had no adverse effects on the mating performance or fertility of male and female rats at a dose approximately 8 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on body surface area comparisons. 13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology Myocardial degeneration was found in mice and rats following administration of abacavir for 2 years. The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic exposure in humans. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>WARNING RISK OF HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, LACTIC ACIDOSIS, AND SEVERE HEPATOMEGALY Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir sulfate. Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multiorgan clinical syndrome usually characterized by a sign or symptom in 2 or more of the following groups (1) fever, (2) rash, (3) gastrointestinal (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain), (4) constitutional (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness), and (5) respiratory (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Discontinue abacavir sulfate as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. Patients who carry the HLAB5701 allele are at high risk for experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Prior to initiating therapy with abacavir, screening for the HLAB5701 allele is recommended this approach has been found to decrease the risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLAB5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. HLAB5701negative patients may develop a suspected hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir however, this occurs significantly less frequently than in HLAB5701positive patients. Regardless of HLAB5701 status, permanently discontinue abacavir sulfate if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible. Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining product because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include lifethreatening hypotension and death. Reintroduction of abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining product, even in patients who have no identified history or unrecognized symptoms of hypersensitivity to abacavir therapy, can result in serious or fatal hypersensitivity reactions. Such reactions can occur within hours see Warnings and Precautions (5.1).

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir sulfate and other abacavircontaining products. Read full prescribing information section 5.1 before prescribing abacavir sulfate. (5.1) Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. (5.2) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.3) and redistributionaccumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.4) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reaction Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir sulfate and other abacavircontaining products. Patients who carry the HLAB  5701 allele are at high risk for experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Prior to initiating therapy with abacavir, screening for the HLAB  5701 allele is recommended this approach has been found to decrease the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLAB  5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. For HLAB  5701positive patients, treatment with an abacavircontaining regimen is not recommended and should be considered only with close medical supervision and under exceptional circumstances when the potential benefit outweighs the risk. HLAB  5701negative patients may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir however, this occurs significantly less frequently than in HLAB  5701positive patients. Regardless of HLAB  5701 status, permanently discontinue abacavir sulfate if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible. Important information on signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, as well as clinical management, is presented below. Signs and Symptoms of Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multiorgan clinical syndrome usually characterized by a sign or symptom in 2 or more of the following groups. Group 1 Fever Group 2 Rash Group 3 Gastrointestinal (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain) Group 4 Constitutional (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness) Group 5 Respiratory (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Hypersensitivity to abacavir following the presentation of a single sign or symptom has been reported infrequently. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 8 of 2,670 subjects (n  206) in 9 clinical trials (range 2 to 9) with enrollment from November 1999 to February 2002. Data on time to onset and symptoms of suspected hypersensitivity were collected on a detailed data collection module. The frequencies of symptoms are shown in Figure 1. Symptoms usually appeared within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir, although the reaction may occur at any time during therapy. Median time to onset was 9 days 89 appeared within the first 6 weeks 95 of subjects reported symptoms from 2 or more of the 5 groups listed above. Figure 1. HypersensitivityRelated Symptoms Reported With 10 Frequency in Clinical Trials (n  206 Subjects) Other less common signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity include lethargy, myolysis, edema, abnormal chest xray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which can be localized), and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death have occurred in association with hypersensitivity reactions. In one trial, 4 subjects (11) receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily experienced hypotension with a hypersensitivity reaction compared with 0 subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily. Physical findings associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir in some patients include lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and rash. The rash usually appears maculopapular or urticarial, but may be variable in appearance. There have been reports of erythema multiforme. Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred without rash. Laboratory abnormalities associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir in some patients include elevated liver function tests, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia. Clinical Management of Hypersensitivity Discontinue abacavir sulfate as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. To minimize the risk of a lifethreatening hypersensitivity reaction, permanently discontinue abacavir sulfate if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza gastroenteritis or reactions to other medications). Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining product because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include lifethreatening hypotension and death. When therapy with abacavir sulfate has been discontinued for reasons other than symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction, and if reinitiation of abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining product is under consideration, carefully evaluate the reason for discontinuation of abacavir sulfate to ensure that the patient did not have symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If the patient is of unknown HLAB5701 status, screening for the allele is recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir sulfate. If hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, DO NOT reintroduce abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining product. Even in the absence of the HLAB5701 allele, it is important to permanently discontinue abacavir and not rechallenge with abacavir if a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction. If symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity are not identified, reintroduction can be undertaken with continued monitoring for symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. Make patients aware that a hypersensitivity reaction can occur with reintroduction of abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining product and that reintroduction of abacavir sulfate or any other abacavircontaining product needs to be undertaken only if medical care can be readily accessed by the patient or others. Risk Factor HLAB5701 Allele Trials have shown that carriage of the HLAB5701 allele is associated with a significantly increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. CNA106030 (PREDICT1), a randomized, doubleblind trial, evaluated the clinical utility of prospective HLAB5701 screening on the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction in abacavirnaive HIV1infected adults (n  1,650). In this trial, use of pretherapy screening for the HLAB5701 allele and exclusion of subjects with this allele reduced the incidence of clinically suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions from 7.8 (66847) to 3.4 (27803). Based on this trial, it is estimated that 61 of patients with the HLAB5701 allele will develop a clinically suspected hypersensitivity reaction during the course of abacavir treatment compared with 4 of patients who do not have the HLAB5701 allele. Screening for carriage of the HLAB5701 allele is recommended prior to initiating treatment with abacavir. Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLAB5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. For HLAB5701positive patients, initiating or reinitiating treatment with an abacavircontaining regimen is not recommended and should be considered only with close medical supervision and under exceptional circumstances where potential benefit outweighs the risk. Skin patch testing is used as a research tool and should not be used to aid in the clinical diagnosis of abacavir hypersensitivity. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decisionmaking. Even in the absence of the HLAB5701 allele, it is important to permanently discontinue abacavir and not rechallenge with abacavir if a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction. Figure 1. HypersensitivityRelated Symptoms Reported With 10 Frequency in Clinical Trials (n  206 Patients) 5.2 Lactic AcidosisSevere Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including abacavir and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering abacavir sulfate to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with abacavir sulfate should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir sulfate. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia PCP, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves disease, polymyositis, and GuillainBarr syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.4 Fat Redistribution Redistributionaccumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and cushingoid appearance have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and longterm consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.5 Myocardial Infarction In a published prospective, observational, epidemiological trial designed to investigate the rate of myocardial infarction in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, the use of abacavir within the previous 6 months was correlated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI).1 In a sponsorconducted pooled analysis of clinical trials, no excess risk of myocardial infarction was observed in abacavirtreated subjects as compared with control subjects. In totality, the available data from the observational cohort and from clinical trials are inconclusive. As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).</td></tr>

The risks of using ziprasidone in combination with other drugs have been evaluated as described below. All interactions studies have been conducted with oral ziprasidone. Based upon the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of ziprasidone, possible interactions could be anticipated Approximately twothirds of ziprasidone is metabolized via a combination of chemical reduction by glutathione and enzymatic reduction by aldehyde oxidase. There are no known clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of aldehyde oxidase. Less than onethird of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is mediated by cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidation. An in vitro enzyme inhibition study utilizing human liver microsomes showed that ziprasidone had little inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and thus would not likely interfere with the metabolism of drugs primarily metabolized by these enzymes. There is little potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3). Ziprasidone should not be used with any drug that prolongs the QT interval see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4.1). Given the primary CNS effects of ziprasidone, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, ziprasidone may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Ziprasidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is an inducer of CYP3A4 administration of 200 mg twice daily for 21 days resulted in a decrease of approximately 35 in the AUC of ziprasidone. This effect may be greater when higher doses of carbamazepine are administered. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, at a dose of 400 mg QD for 5 days, increased the AUC and Cmax of ziprasidone by about 35 to 40. Other inhibitors of CYP3A4 would be expected to have similar effects. Cimetidine Cimetidine at a dose of 800 mg QD for 2 days did not affect ziprasidone pharmacokinetics. Antacid The coadministration of 30 mL of Maalox with ziprasidone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Ziprasidone at a dose of 40 mg twice daily administered concomitantly with lithium at a dose of 450 mg twice daily for 7 days did not affect the steadystate level or renal clearance of lithium. In vivo studies have revealed no effect of ziprasidone on the pharmacokinetics of estrogen or progesterone components. Ziprasidone at a dose of 20 mg twice daily did not affect the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered oral contraceptives, ethinyl estradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg). Consistent with in vitro results, a study in normal healthy volunteers showed that ziprasidone did not alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 model substrate, to its major metabolite, dextrorphan. There was no statistically significant change in the urinary dextromethorphandextrorphan ratio. A pharmacokinetic interaction of ziprasidone with valproate is unlikely due to the lack of common metabolic pathways for the two drugs. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of schizophrenic patients enrolled in controlled clinical trials has not revealed evidence of any clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with benztropine, propranolol, or lorazepam. The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose under fed conditions is approximately 60. The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to twofold in the presence of food see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>"INDICATIONS  USAGE Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. When deciding among the alternative treatments available for the condition needing treatment, the prescriber should consider the finding of ziprasidones greater capacity to prolong the QTQTc interval compared to several other antipsychotic drugs see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2). Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated in some other drugs with the ability to cause torsade de pointestype arrhythmia, a potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs should be tried first. Whether ziprasidone will cause torsade de pointes or increase the rate of sudden death is not yet known see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. The efficacy of oral ziprasidone was established in four shortterm (4 and 6week) controlled trials of adult schizophrenic inpatients and in one maintenance trial of stable adult schizophrenic inpatients see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Ziprasidone has not been systematically studied, in animals or humans, for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which ziprasidone will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of ziprasidone misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS Commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence 5 and at least twice the incidence for placebo) were  Schizophrenia Somnolence, respiratory tract infection ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 18005258747 or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical trials for oral ziprasidone included approximately 5,700 patients andor normal subjects exposed to one or more doses of ziprasidone. Of these 5700, over 4800 were patients who participated in multipledose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 1,831 patientyears. These patients include (1) 4,331 patients who participated in multipledose trials, predominantly in schizophrenia, representing approximately 1698 patientyears of exposure as of February 5,2000. The conditions and duration of treatment with ziprasidone included openlabel and doubleblind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and shortterm and longerterm exposure. Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by collecting voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials with Oral Ziprasidone The following findings are based on the shortterm placebocontrolled premarketing trials for schizophrenia (a pool of two 6week, and two 4week fixeddose trials) in which ziprasidone was administered in doses ranging from 10 to 200 mgday. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short TermPlaceboControlled Trials The following adverse reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of ziprasidone (incidence of 5 or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebotreated patients (ziprasidone incidence at least twice that for placebo) Schizophrenia trials (see Table 6) SomnolenceRespiratory Tract Infection SCHIZOPHRENIA Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials of Oral Ziprasidone Approximately 4.1 (29702) of ziprasidonetreated patients in shortterm, placebocontrolled studies discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with about 2.2 (6273) on placebo. The most common reaction associated with dropout was rash, including 7 dropouts for rash among ziprasidone patients (1) compared to no placebo patients See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2 or More Among ZiprasidoneTreated Patients in ShortTerm, Oral, PlaceboControlled Trials Table 6 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks) in predominantly patients with schizophrenia, including only those reactions that occurred in 2 or more of patients treated with ziprasidone and for which the incidence in patients treated with ziprasidone was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients.

None of these adverse reactions occurred individually at an incidence greater than 5 in schizophrenia trials. Dizziness includes the adverse reaction terms dizziness and lightheadedness. Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, FixedDose, PlaceboControlled Trials An analysis for dose response in the schizophrenia 4study pool revealed an apparent relation of adverse reaction to dose for the following reactions asthenia, postural hypotension, anorexia, dry mouth, increased salivation, arthralgia, anxiety, dizziness, dystonia, hypertonia, somnolence, tremor, rhinitis, rash, and abnormal vision. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) The incidence of reported EPS (which included the adverse reaction terms extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, dystonia, dyskinesia, hypokinesia, tremor, paralysis and twitching) for ziprasidonetreated patients in the shortterm, placebocontrolled schizophrenia trials was 14 vs. 8 for placebo. Objectively collected data from those trials on the SimpsonAngus Rating Scale (for EPS) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia) did not generally show a difference between ziprasidone and placebo. Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Vital Sign Changes Ziprasidone is associated with orthostatic hypotension see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7). ECG Changes Ziprasidone is associated with an increase in the QTc interval see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2). In the schizophrenia trials, ziprasidone was associated with a mean increase in heart rate of 1.4 beats per minute compared to a 0.2 beats per minute decrease among placebo patients.

It is not meant to take the place of your doctors instructions. Read this information carefully before you take ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand any of this information or if you want to know more about ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules. What are ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules? Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are a type of prescription medicine called a psychotropic, also known as an atypical antipsychotic. Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules can be used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia. Who should take ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules? Only your doctor can know if ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are right for you. Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed for you if you have schizophrenia. Symptoms of schizophrenia may include hearing voices, seeing things, or sensing things that are not there (hallucinations)beliefs that are not true (delusions)unusual suspiciousness (paranoia)becoming withdrawn from family and friends If you show a response to ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules, your symptoms may improve. If you continue to take ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules there is less chance of your symptoms returning. Do not stop taking the capsules even when you feel better without first discussing it with your doctor. It is also important to remember that ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules should be taken with food. What is the most important safety information I should know about ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules? Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis. Elderly patients with a diagnosis of psychosis related to dementia treated with antipsychotics are at an increased risk of death when compared to patients who are treated with placebo (a sugar pill). Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are an effective drug to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, one potential side effect is that it may change the way the electrical current in your heart works more than some other drugs. The change is small and it is not known whether this will be harmful, but some other drugs that cause this kind of change have in rare cases caused dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities. Because of this, ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules should be used only after your doctor has considered this risk for ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules against the risks and benefits of other medications available for treating schizophrenia. Your risk of dangerous changes in heart rhythm can be increased if you are taking certain other medicines and if you already have certain abnormal heart conditions. Therefore, it is important to tell your doctor about any other medicines that you take, including nonprescription medicines, supplements, and herbal medicines. You must also tell your doctor about any heart problems you have or have had. Who should NOT take ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules? Elderly patients with a diagnosis of psychosis related to dementia. Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are not approved for the treatment of these patients. Anything that can increase the chance of a heart rhythm abnormality should be avoided. Therefore, do not take ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules if You have certain heart diseases, for example, long QT syndrome, a recent heart attack, severe heart failure, or certain irregularities of heart rhythm (discuss the specifics with your doctor)You are currently taking medications that should not be taken in combination with ziprasidone, for example, dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, other Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, droperidol, pimozide, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine, arsenic trioxide, levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus. What to tell your doctor before you start ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules Only your doctor can decide if ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are right for you. Before you start ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules, be sure to tell your doctor if you have had any problem with the way your heart beats or any heart related illness or diseaseany family history of heart disease, including recent heart attackhave had any problem with fainting or dizzinessare taking or have recently taken any prescription medicinesare taking any overthecounter medicines you can buy without a prescription, including naturalherbal remedieshave had any problems with your liverare pregnant, might be pregnant, or plan to get pregnantare breast feedingare allergic to any medicineshave ever had an allergic reaction to ziprasidone or any of the other ingredients of ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules.

It is particularly important to tell your doctor if you have diarrhea, vomiting, or another illness that can cause you to lose fluids. Your doctor may want to check your blood to make sure that you have the right amount of important salts after such illnesses. For a list of all side effects that have been reported, ask your doctor or pharmacist for the ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules Professional Package Insert. What to do for an overdose In case of an overdose, call your doctor or poison control center right away or go to the nearest emergency room. Other important safety information A serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) can occur with all antipsychotic medications including ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules. Signs of NMS include very high fever, rigid muscles, shaking, confusion, sweating, or increased heart rate and blood pressure. NMS is a rare but serious side effect that could be fatal. Therefore, tell your doctor if you experience any of these signs. Adverse reactions related to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), sometimes serious, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules, and it is not known if ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are associated with these reactions. Patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia. Dizziness caused by a drop in your blood pressure may occur with ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules, especially when you first start taking this medication or when the dose is increased. If this happens, be careful not to stand up too quickly, and talk to your doctor about the problem. Before taking ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules, tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant. It is advised that you dont breast feed an infant if you are taking ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules. Because ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules can cause sleepiness, be careful when operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Since medications of the same drug class as ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules may interfere with the ability of the body to adjust to heat, it is best to avoid situations involving high temperature or humidity. It is best to avoid consuming alcoholic beverages while taking ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules. Call your doctor immediately if you take more than the amount of ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules prescribed by your doctor.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Give oral doses with food. Schizophrenia Initiate at 20 mg twice daily. Daily dosage may be adjusted up to 80 mg twice daily. Dose adjustments should occur at intervals of not less than 2 days. Safety and efficacy has been demonstrated in doses up to 100 mg twice daily. The lowest effective dose should be used. ( 2.1 ) Dose Selection Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules should be administered at an initial daily dose of 20 mg twice daily with food. In some patients, daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status up to 80 mg twice daily. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 2 days, as steadystate is achieved within 1 to 3 days. In order to ensure use of the lowest effective dose, patients should ordinarily be observed for improvement for several weeks before upward dosage adjustment. Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 20 mg to 100 mg twice daily in shortterm, placebocontrolled clinical trials. There were trends toward dose response within the range of 20 mg to 80 mg twice daily, but results were not consistent. An increase to a dose greater than 80 mg twice daily is not generally recommended. The safety of doses above 100 mg twice daily has not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1). Maintenance Treatment While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient treated with ziprasidone should remain on it, a maintenance study in patients who had been symptomatically stable and then randomized to continue ziprasidone or switch to placebo demonstrated a delay in time to relapse for patients receiving ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules. see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1). No additional benefit was demonstrated for doses above 20 mg twice daily. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Oral Dosage adjustments are generally not required on the basis of age, gender, race, or renal or hepatic impairment.

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of ziprasidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drugs efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Ziprasidone exhibited high in vitro binding affinity for the dopamine D2 and D3, the serotonin 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT1A, 5HT1D, and 1adrenergic receptors (Kis of 4.8, 7.2, 0.4, 1.3, 3.4, 2, and 10 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the histamine H1 receptor (Ki47 nM). Ziprasidone functioned as an antagonist at the D2, 5HT2A, and 5HT1D receptors, and as an agonist at the 5HT1A receptor. Ziprasidone inhibited synaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. No appreciable affinity was exhibited for other receptorbinding sites tested, including the cholinergic muscarinic receptor (IC50 1 M). Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of ziprasidone. Ziprasidones antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Ziprasidones antagonism of 1adrenergic receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. Oral Pharmacokinetics Ziprasidones activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multipledose pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone are doseproportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and ziprasidone accumulation is predictable with multiple dosing. Elimination of ziprasidone is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal halflife of about 7 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steadystate concentrations are achieved within one to three days of dosing. The mean apparent systemic clearance is 7.5 mLminkg. Ziprasidone is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Absorption Ziprasidone is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 6 to 8 hours. The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose under fed conditions is approximately 60. The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to twofold in the presence of food. Distribution Ziprasidone has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 1.5 Lkg. It is greater than 99 bound to plasma proteins, binding primarily to albumin and 1acid glycoprotein. The in vitro plasma protein binding of ziprasidone was not altered by warfarin or propranolol, two highly proteinbound drugs, nor did ziprasidone alter the binding of these drugs in human plasma. Thus, the potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement is minimal. Metabolism and Elimination Ziprasidone is extensively metabolized after oral administration with only a small amount excreted in the urine (1) or feces (4) as unchanged drug. Ziprasidone is primarily cleared via three metabolic routes to yield four major circulating metabolites, benzisothiazole (BITP) sulphoxide, BITPsulphone, ziprasidone sulphoxide, and Smethyldihydroziprasidone. Approximately 20 of the dose is excreted in the urine, with approximately 66 being eliminated in the feces. Unchanged ziprasidone represents about 44 of total drugrelated material in serum. In vitro studies using human liver subcellular fractions indicate that Smethyldihydroziprasidone is generated in two steps. These studies indicate that the reduction reaction is mediated primarily by chemical reduction by glutathione as well as by enzymatic reduction by aldehyde oxidase and the subsequent methylation is mediated by thiol methyltransferase. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes indicate that CYP3A4 is the major CYP contributing to the oxidative metabolism of ziprasidone. CYP1A2 may contribute to a much lesser extent. Based on in vivo abundance of excretory metabolites, less than onethird of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is mediated by cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidation and approximately twothirds via reduction. There are no known clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of aldehyde oxidase."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of oral ziprasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in 5 placebocontrolled studies, 4 shortterm (4 and 6week) trials and one maintenance trial. All trials were in adult inpatients, most of whom met DSM IIIR criteria for schizophrenia. Each study included 2 to 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone as well as placebo. Four of the 5 trials were able to distinguish ziprasidone from placebo one shortterm study did not. Although a single fixeddose haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in one of the three shortterm trials, this single study was inadequate to provide a reliable and valid comparison of ziprasidone and haloperidol. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) are both multiitem inventories of general psychopathology usually used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second widely used assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, the Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS) was employed for assessing negative symptoms in one trial. The results of the oral ziprasidone trials in schizophrenia follow In a 4week, placebocontrolled trial (n139) comparing 2 fixed doses of ziprasidone (20 and 60 mg twice daily) with placebo, only the 60 mg dose was superior to placebo on the BPRS total score and the CGI severity score. This higher dose group was not superior to placebo on the BPRS psychosis cluster or on the SANS.In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n302) comparing 2 fixed doses of ziprasidone (40 and 80 mg twice daily) with placebo, both dose groups were superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, the CGI severity score and the PANSS total and negative subscale scores. Although 80 mg twice daily had a numerically greater effect than 40 mg twice daily, the difference was not statistically significant.In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n419) comparing 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone (20, 60, and 100 mg twice daily) with placebo, all three dose groups were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score, the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. Only the 100 mg twice daily dose group was superior to placebo on the PANSS negative subscale score. There was no clear evidence for a doseresponse relationship within the 20 mg twice daily to 100 mg twice daily dose range.In a 4week, placebocontrolled trial (n200) comparing 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone (5,20, and 40 mg twice daily), none of the dose groups was statistically superior to placebo on any outcome of interest.A study was conducted in stable chronic or subchronic (CGIS  5 at baseline) schizophrenic inpatients (n294) who had been hospitalized for not less than two months. After a 3day singleblind placebo runin, subjects were randomized to one of 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone (20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg twice daily) or placebo and observed for relapse. Patients were observed for "impending psychotic relapse," defined as CGIimprovement score of  6 (much worse or very much worse) andor scores  6 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS on two consecutive days. Ziprasidone was significantly superior to placebo in time to relapse, with no significant difference between the different dose groups. There were insufficient data to examine population subsets based on age and race. Examination of population subsets based on gender did not reveal any differential responsiveness.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  Pregnancy Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk ( 8.1 ). Nursing Mothers Breast feeding is not recommended ( 8.3 ) Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness for pediatric patients has not been established ( 8.4 ) Pregnancy Category C In animal studies ziprasidone demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects at doses similar to human therapeutic doses. When ziprasidone was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, an increased incidence of fetal structural abnormalities (ventricular septal defects and other cardiovascular malformations and kidney alterations) was observed at a dose of 30 mgkgday (3 times the MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis). There was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 10 mgkgday (equivalent to the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). In rats, embryofetal toxicity (decreased fetal weights, delayed skeletal ossification) was observed following administration of 10 to 160 mgkgday (0.5 to 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) during organogenesis or throughout gestation, but there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Doses of 40 and 160 mgkgday (2 and 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) were associated with maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). There was an increase in the number of pups born dead and a decrease in postnatal survival through the first 4 days of lactation among the offspring of female rats treated during gestation and lactation with doses of 10 mgkgday (0.5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. Offspring developmental delays and neurobehavioral functional impairment were observed at doses of 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. A noeffect level was not established for these effects. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Ziprasidone hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The effect of ziprasidone on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. It is not known whether ziprasidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. It is recommended that women receiving ziprasidone should not breastfeed. The safety and effectiveness of ziprasidone in pediatric patients have not been established. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ziprasidone, 2.4 percent were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the presence of multiple factors that might increase the pharmacodynamic response to ziprasidone, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period for some elderly patients. Because ziprasidone is highly metabolized, with less than 1 of the drug excreted unchanged, renal impairment alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. The pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone following 8 days of 20 mg twice daily dosing were similar among subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (n27), and subjects with normal renal function, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. Ziprasidone is not removed by hemodialysis. As ziprasidone is cleared substantially by the liver, the presence of hepatic impairment would be expected to increase the AUC of ziprasidone a multipledose study at 20 mg twice daily for 5 days in subjects (n13) with clinically significant (ChildsPugh Class A and B) cirrhosis revealed an increase in AUC 012 of 13 and 34 in ChildsPugh Class A and B, respectively, compared to a matched control group (n14). A halflife of 7.1 hours was observed in subjects with cirrhosis compared to 4.8 hours in the control group. In a multipledose (8 days of treatment) study involving 32 subjects, there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone between men and women or between elderly (65 years) and young (18 to 45 years) subjects. Additionally, population pharmacokinetic evaluation of patients in controlled trials has revealed no evidence of clinically significant age or genderrelated differences in the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Dosage modifications for age or gender are, therefore, not recommended. Based on in vitro studies utilizing human liver enzymes, ziprasidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2 smoking should therefore not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Consistent with these in vitro results, population pharmacokinetic evaluation has not revealed any significant pharmacokinetic differences between smokers and nonsmokers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Carcinogenesis Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted with ziprasidone in Long Evans rats and CD1 mice. Ziprasidone was administered for 24 months in the diet at doses of 2, 6, or 12 mgkgday to rats, and 50, 100, or 200 mgkgday to mice (0.1 to 0.6 and 1 to 5 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis, respectively). In the rat study, there was no evidence of an increased incidence of tumors compared to controls. In male mice, there was no increase in incidence of tumors relative to controls. In female mice, there were doserelated increases in the incidences of pituitary gland adenoma and carcinoma, and mammary gland adenocarcinoma at all doses tested (50 to 200 mgkgday or 1 to 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). Proliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary glands of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered to be prolactinmediated. Increases in serum prolactin were observed in a 1month dietary study in female, but not male, mice at 100 and 200 mgkgday (or 2.5 and 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). Ziprasidone had no effect on serum prolactin in rats in a 5week dietary study at the doses that were used in the carcinogenicity study. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactinmediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.11). Mutagenesis Ziprasidone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation mouse lymphoma assay, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes, and the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in mouse bone marrow. There was a reproducible mutagenic response in the Ames assay in one strain of S. typhimurium in the absence of metabolic activation. Positive results were obtained in both the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation assay and the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Impairment of Fertility Ziprasidone was shown to increase time to copulation in SpragueDawley rats in two fertility and early embryonic development studies at doses of 10 to 160 mgkgday (0.5 to 8 times the MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis). Fertility rate was reduced at 160 mgkgday (8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). There was no effect on fertility at 40 mgkgday (2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). The effect on fertility appeared to be in the female since fertility was not impaired when males given 160 mgkgday (8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) were mated with untreated females. In a 6month study in male rats given 200 mgkgday (10 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) there were no treatmentrelated findings observed in the testes.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>Boxed Warning section Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE In premarketing trials involving more than 5,400 patients andor normal subjects, accidental or intentional overdosage of oral ziprasidone was documented in 10 patients. All of these patients survived without sequelae. In the patient taking the largest confirmed amount, 3,240 mg, the only symptoms reported were minimal sedation, slurring of speech, and transitory hypertension (20095). Adverse reactions reported with ziprasidone overdose included extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, tremor, and anxiety. see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2) In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Intravenous access should be established, and gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QTprolonging effects that might be additive to those of ziprasidone. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids. If sympathomimetic agents are used for vascular support, epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation combined with 1 antagonism associated with ziprasidone may worsen hypotension. Similarly, it is reasonable to expect that the alphaadrenergicblocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of ziprasidone, resulting in problematic hypotension. In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. There is no specific antidote to ziprasidone, and it is not dialyzable. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  QT Interval Prolongation  ziprasidone hydrochloride use should be avoided in patients with bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, congenital prolongation of the QT interval, or in combination with other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation ( 5.2 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Potentially fatal symptom complex has been reported with antipsychotic drugs. Manage with immediate discontinuation of drug and close monitoring. ( 5.3 )  Tardive Dyskinesia May develop acutely or chronically ( 5.4 )  Metabolic Changes  Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. ( 5.5 ) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Monitor all patients for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients with DM risk factors should undergo blood glucose testing before and during treatment. ( 5.5 ) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. ( 5.5 ) Weight Gain Weight gain has been reported. Monitor weight gain. ( 5.5 ) Rash Discontinue in patients who develop a rash without an identified cause ( 5.6 ) Orthostatic Hypotension Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease ( 5.7 ) Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis has been reported with antipsychotics. Patients with a preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) or a history of leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue ziprasidone hydrochloride at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors ( 5.8 ). Seizures Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower seizure threshold ( 5. 9) Potential for Cognitive and Motor impairment Patients should use caution when operating machinery ( 5.1 2) Suicide Closely supervise highrisk patients ( 5.1 5) Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Ziprasidone hydrochloride is not approved for the treatment of dementiarelated psychosis.  see BOXED WARNING Ziprasidone use should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4.1), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4). Additionally, clinicians should be alert to the identification of other drugs that have been consistently observed to prolong the QTc interval. Such drugs should not be prescribed with ziprasidone. Ziprasidone should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4). A study directly comparing the QTQTc prolonging effect of oral ziprasidone with several other drugs effective in the treatment of schizophrenia was conducted in patient volunteers. In the first phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration when the drug was administered alone. In the second phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration while the drug was coadministered with an inhibitor of the CYP4503A4 metabolism of the drug. In the first phase of the study, the mean change in QTc from baseline was calculated for each drug, using a samplebased correction that removes the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for ziprasidone ranged from approximately 9 to 14 msec greater than for four of the comparator drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol), but was approximately 14 msec less than the prolongation observed for thioridazine. In the second phase of the study, the effect of ziprasidone on QTc length was not augmented by the presence of a metabolic inhibitor (ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily). In placebocontrolled trials, oral ziprasidone increased the QTc interval compared to placebo by approximately 10 msec at the highest recommended daily dose of 160 mg. In clinical trials with oral ziprasidone, the electrocardiograms of 22,988 (0.06) patients who received ziprasidone hydrochloride and 1440 (0.23) patients who received placebo revealed QTc intervals exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. In the ziprasidonetreated patients, neither case suggested a role of ziprasidone. One patient had a history of prolonged QTc and a screening measurement of 489 msec QTc was 503 msec during ziprasidone treatment. The other patient had a QTc of 391 msec at the end of treatment with ziprasidone and upon switching to thioridazine experienced QTc measurements of 518 and 593 msec. Some drugs that prolong the QTQTc interval have been associated with the occurrence of torsade de pointes and with sudden unexplained death. The relationship of QT prolongation to torsade de pointes is clearest for larger increases (20 msec and greater) but it is possible that smaller QTQTc prolongations may also increase risk, or increase it in susceptible individuals. Although torsade de pointes has not been observed in association with the use of ziprasidone in premarketing studies and experience is too limited to rule out an increased risk, there have been rare postmarketing reports (in the presence of multiple confounding factors) see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2). As with other antipsychotic drugs and placebo, sudden unexplained deaths have been reported in patients taking ziprasidone at recommended doses. The premarketing experience for ziprasidone did not reveal an excess risk of mortality for ziprasidone compared to other antipsychotic drugs or placebo, but the extent of exposure was limited, especially for the drugs used as active controls and placebo. Nevertheless, ziprasidones larger prolongation of QTc length compared to several other antipsychotic drugs raises the possibility that the risk of sudden death may be greater for ziprasidone than for other available drugs for treating schizophrenia. This possibility needs to be considered in deciding among alternative drug products see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1). Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes andor sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. It is recommended that patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment who are at risk for significant electrolyte disturbances, hypokalemia in particular, have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Hypokalemia (andor hypomagnesemia) may increase the risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmia. Hypokalemia may result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Patients with low serum potassium andor magnesium should be repleted with those electrolytes before proceeding with treatment. It is essential to periodically monitor serum electrolytes in patients for whom diuretic therapy is introduced during ziprasidone treatment. Persistently prolonged QTc intervals may also increase the risk of further prolongation and arrhythmia, but it is not clear that routine screening ECG measures are effective in detecting such patients. Rather, ziprasidone should be avoided in patients with histories of significant cardiovascular illness, e.g., QT prolongation, recent acute myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia. Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements 500 msec. For patients taking ziprasidone who experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes, e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope, the prescriber should initiate further evaluation, e.g., Holter monitoring may be useful. A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients undergoing treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, ziprasidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ziprasidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ziprasidone despite the presence of the syndrome. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascularcerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with ziprasidone hydrochloride. Although fewer patients have been treated with ziprasidone hydrochloride, it is not known if this more limited experience is the sole reason for the paucity of such reports. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions is not completely understood. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. Pooled data from shortterm, placebocontrolled studies in schizophrenia are presented in Tables 1 to 2. Note that for the flexible dose studies in schizophrenia each subject is categorized as having received either low (20 to 40 mg BID) or high (60 to 80 mg BID) dose based on the subjects modal daily dose.

Weight Gain Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Monitoring of weight is recommended.

In the same longterm studies, the proportion of subjects with  7 increase in weight from baseline for ziprasidone 20 to 40 mg BID was 5.6 (N124) for ziprasidone 60 to 80 mg BID was 20 (N10), and for placebo was 5.6 (N72). In a longterm (at least 1 year), placebocontrolled, fixeddose study in schizophrenia, the mean change from baseline weight for ziprasidone 20 mg BID was 2.6 kg (N72) for ziprasidone 40 mg BID was 3.3 kg (N69) for ziprasidone 80 mg BID was 2.8 kg (N70) and for placebo was 3.8 kg (N70). In the same longterm fixeddose schizophrenia study, the proportion of subjects with  7 increase in weight from baseline for ziprasidone 20 mg BID was 5.6 (N72) for ziprasidone 40 mg BID was 2.9 (N69) for ziprasidone 80 mg BID was 5.7 (N70) and for placebo was 2.9 (N70) Schizophrenia The proportions of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7 of body weight were compared in a pool of four 4 and 6week placebocontrolled schizophrenia clinical trials, revealing a statistically significantly greater incidence of weight gain for ziprasidone (10) compared to placebo (4). A median weight gain of 0.5 kg was observed in ziprasidone patients compared to no median weight change in placebo patients. In this set of clinical trials, weight gain was reported as an adverse reaction in 0.4 and 0.4 of ziprasidone and placebo patients, respectively. During longterm therapy with ziprasidone, a categorization of patients at baseline on the basis of body mass index (BMI) revealed the greatest mean weight gain and highest incidence of clinically significant weight gain (7 of body weight) in patients with low BMI (23) compared to normal (23 to 27) or <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> patients (27). There was a mean weight gain of 1.4 kg for those patients with a low baseline BMI, no mean change for patients with a normal BMI, and a 1.3 kg mean weight loss for patients who entered the program with a high BMI. In premarketing trials with ziprasidone, about 5 of patients developed rash andor urticaria, with discontinuation of treatment in about onesixth of these cases. The occurrence of rash was related to dose of ziprasidone, although the finding might also be explained by the longer exposure time in the higher dose patients. Several patients with rash had signs and symptoms of associated systemic illness, e.g., elevated WBCs. Most patients improved promptly with adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids andor upon discontinuation of ziprasidone, and all patients experiencing these reactions were reported to recover completely. Upon appearance of rash for which an alternative etiology cannot be identified, ziprasidone should be discontinued. Ziprasidone may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its 1adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 0.6 of the patients treated with ziprasidone. Ziprasidone should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue ziprasidone hydrochloride at the first sign of decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm3) should discontinue ziprasidone hydrochloride and have their WBC followed until recovery. During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.4 of patients treated with ziprasidone. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. As with other antipsychotic drugs, ziprasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimers dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimers dementia. Ziprasidone and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia see BOXED WARNING. As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, ziprasidone elevates prolactin levels in humans. Increased prolactin levels were also observed in animal studies with this compound, and were associated with an increase in mammary gland neoplasia in mice a similar effect was not observed in rats see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1).Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactindependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactinelevating compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Longstanding hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density. Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction in patients treated with ziprasidone. In the 4 and 6week placebocontrolled trials, somnolence was reported in 14 of patients on ziprasidone compared to 7 of placebo patients. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.3 of patients in shortterm clinical trials. Since ziprasidone has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that ziprasidone therapy does not affect them adversely. One case of priapism was reported in the premarketing database. While the relationship of the reaction to ziprasidone use has not been established, other drugs with alphaadrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism, and it is possible that ziprasidone may share this capacity. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention. Although not reported with ziprasidone in premarketing trials, disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ziprasidone for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration. The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illness and close supervision of highrisk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for ziprasidone should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Clinical experience with ziprasidone in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6), (8.7). Ziprasidone has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Because of the risk of QTc prolongation and orthostatic hypotension with ziprasidone, caution should be observed in cardiac patients see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2), (5.7). Patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment that are at risk of significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Low serum potassium and magnesium should be replaced before proceeding with treatment. Patients who are started on diuretics during Ziprasidone therapy need periodic monitoring of serum potassium and magnesium. Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements 500 msec. see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)"</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Progesterone has not been tested for carcinogenicity in animals by the oral route of administration. When implanted into female mice, progesterone produced mammary carcinomas, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and endometrial stromal sarcomas. In dogs, longterm intramuscular injections produced nodular hyperplasia and benign and malignant mammary tumors. Subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of progesterone decreased the latency period and increased the incidence of mammary tumors in rats previously treated with a chemical carcinogen. Progesterone did not show evidence of genotoxicity in in vitro studies for point mutations or for chromosomal damage. In vivo studies for chromosome damage have yielded positive results in mice at oral doses of 1000 mgkg and 2000 mgkg. Exogenously administered progesterone has been shown to inhibit ovulation in a number of species and it is expected that high doses given for an extended duration would impair fertility until the cessation of treatment.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>Pharmacokinetics A. Absorption After oral administration of progesterone as a micronized softgelatin capsule formulation, maximum serum concentrations were attained within 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of micronized progesterone is not known. Table 1 summarizes the mean pharmacokinetic parameters in postmenopausal women after five oral daily doses of PROMETRIUM Capsules 100 mg as a micronized softgelatin capsule formulation. TABLE 1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of PROMETRIUM Capsules a Mean  S.D. Parameter PROMETRIUM Capsules Daily Dose 100 mg 200 mg 300 mg Cmax (ngmL) 17.3  21.9a 38.1  37.8 60.6  72.5 Tmax (hr) 1.5  0.8 2.3  1.4 1.7  0.6 AUC(010) (ng  hrmL) 43.3  30.8 101.2  66.0 175.7  170.3 Serum progesterone concentrations appeared linear and dose proportional following multiple dose administration of PROMETRIUM Capsules 100 mg over the dose range 100 mg per day to 300 mg per day in postmenopausal women. Although doses greater than 300 mg per day were not studied in females, serum concentrations from a study in male volunteers appeared linear and dose proportional between 100 mg per day and 400 mg per day. The pharmacokinetic parameters in male volunteers were generally consistent with those seen in postmenopausal women. B. Distribution Progesterone is approximately 96 percent to 99 percent bound to serum proteins, primarily to serum albumin (50 to 54 percent) and transcortin (43 to 48 percent). C. Metabolism Progesterone is metabolized primarily by the liver largely to pregnanediols and pregnanolones. Pregnanediols and pregnanolones are conjugated in the liver to glucuronide and sulfate metabolites. Progesterone metabolites which are excreted in the bile may be deconjugated and may be further metabolized in the intestine via reduction, dehydroxylation, and epimerization. D. Excretion The glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of pregnanediol and pregnanolone are excreted in the bile and urine. Progesterone metabolites are eliminated mainly by the kidneys. Progesterone metabolites which are excreted in the bile may undergo enterohepatic recycling or may be excreted in the feces. E. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of PROMETRIUM Capsules have not been assessed in low body weight or obese patients. Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of PROMETRIUM Capsules has not been studied. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of PROMETRIUM Capsules has not been studied. F. FoodDrug Interaction Concomitant food ingestion increased the bioavailability of PROMETRIUM Capsules relative to a fasting state when administered to postmenopausal women at a dose of 200 mg. G. Drug Interactions The metabolism of progesterone by human liver microsomes was inhibited by ketoconazole (IC50  0.1 M). Ketoconazole is a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, hence these data suggest that ketoconazole or other known inhibitors of this enzyme may increase the bioavailability of progesterone. The clinical relevance of the in vitro findings is unknown. Coadministration of conjugated estrogens and PROMETRIUM Capsules to 29 postmenopausal women over a 12day period resulted in an increase in total estrone concentrations (Cmax 3.68 ngmL to 4.93 ngmL) and total equilin concentrations (Cmax 2.27 ngmL to 3.22 ngmL) and a decrease in circulating 17 estradiol concentrations (Cmax 0.037 ngmL to 0.030 ngmL). The halflife of the conjugated estrogens was similar with coadministration of PROMETRIUM Capsules. Table 2 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters. TABLE 2. Mean ( S.D.)

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS A. General 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared with estrogenalone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Fluid Retention Progesterone may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation. 3. Dizziness and Drowsiness PROMETRIUM Capsules may cause transient dizziness and drowsiness and should be used with caution when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. PROMETRIUM Capsules should be taken as a single daily dose at bedtime. B. Patient Information General This product contains peanut oil and should not be used if you are allergic to peanuts. Physicians are advised to discuss the contents of the Patient Information leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe PROMETRIUM Capsules. C. DrugLaboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy Increased sulfobromophthalein retention and other hepatic function tests. Coagulation tests increase in prothrombin factors VII, VIII, IX and X. Pregnanediol determination. Thyroid function increase in PBI, and butanol extractable protein bound iodine and decrease in T3 uptake values. D.

F. Nursing Women Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the milk of nursing women receiving progestins. Caution should be exercised when PROMETRIUM Capsules are administered to a nursing woman. G. Pediatric Use PROMETRIUM Capsules are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing PROMETRIUM Capsules to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to PROMETRIUM Capsules. The Womens Health Initiative Study In the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE 0.625 mg plus MPA 2.5 mg versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular disorders and Malignant neoplasms .) The Womens Health Initiative Memory Study In the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in the estrogen plus progestin ancillary study when compared to placebo.

Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared with estrogenalone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Fluid Retention Progesterone may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation. 3. Dizziness and Drowsiness PROMETRIUM Capsules may cause transient dizziness and drowsiness and should be used with caution when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery.

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>"WARNINGS See BOXED WARNING . 1. Cardiovascular disorders An increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stroke, and myocardial infarction has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) andor venous thromboembolism (for example, personal history or family history of venous thromboembolism VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 womenyears). The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically nonsignificant increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction MI, silent MI, or CHD death) reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 womenyears). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1 and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n  2,763, average age 66.7 years), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and EstrogenProgestin Replacement Study HERS), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average followup of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPAtreated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twentyone (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an openlabel extension of HERS, HERS II. Average followup in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and pulmonary embolism PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 womenyears). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 womenyears) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 womenyears) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens with progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean followup of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogenalone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 (95 percent nCI, 1.011.54), and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 womenyears, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 womenyears, for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 womenyears for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogenalone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogenalone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast selfexaminations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in nonusers, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15 to 24fold for 5 to 10 years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically nonsignificant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average followup of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent nCI, 0.77  3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 womenyears. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogenonly products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable dementia In the estrogen plus progestin Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, after an average followup of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for estrogen plus progestin versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.213.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 womenyears. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .) 4. Vision abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogen. Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."</td></tr>

Parameter PROMETRIUM Capsules Daily Dose 100 mg 200 mg 300 mg Cmax (ngmL) 17.3  21.9a 38.1  37.8 60.6  72.5 Tmax (hr) 1.5  0.8 2.3  1.4 1.7  0.6 AUC(010) (ng  hrmL) 43.3  30.8 101.2  66.0 175.7  170.3 Serum progesterone concentrations appeared linear and dose proportional following multiple dose administration of PROMETRIUM Capsules 100 mg over the dose range 100 mg per day to 300 mg per day in postmenopausal women. Although doses greater than 300 mg per day were not studied in females, serum concentrations from a study in male volunteers appeared linear and dose proportional between 100 mg per day and 400 mg per day. The pharmacokinetic parameters in male volunteers were generally consistent with those seen in postmenopausal women. B. Distribution Progesterone is approximately 96 percent to 99 percent bound to serum proteins, primarily to serum albumin (50 to 54 percent) and transcortin (43 to 48 percent). C. Metabolism Progesterone is metabolized primarily by the liver largely to pregnanediols and pregnanolones. Pregnanediols and pregnanolones are conjugated in the liver to glucuronide and sulfate metabolites. Progesterone metabolites which are excreted in the bile may be deconjugated and may be further metabolized in the intestine via reduction, dehydroxylation, and epimerization. D. Excretion The glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of pregnanediol and pregnanolone are excreted in the bile and urine. Progesterone metabolites are eliminated mainly by the kidneys. Progesterone metabolites which are excreted in the bile may undergo enterohepatic recycling or may be excreted in the feces. E. Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of PROMETRIUM Capsules have not been assessed in low body weight or obese patients. Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of PROMETRIUM Capsules has not been studied. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of PROMETRIUM Capsules has not been studied. F. FoodDrug Interaction Concomitant food ingestion increased the bioavailability of PROMETRIUM Capsules relative to a fasting state when administered to postmenopausal women at a dose of 200 mg. G. Drug Interactions The metabolism of progesterone by human liver microsomes was inhibited by ketoconazole (IC50  0.1 M). Ketoconazole is a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, hence these data suggest that ketoconazole or other known inhibitors of this enzyme may increase the bioavailability of progesterone. The clinical relevance of the in vitro findings is unknown. Coadministration of conjugated estrogens and PROMETRIUM Capsules to 29 postmenopausal women over a 12day period resulted in an increase in total estrone concentrations (Cmax 3.68 ngmL to 4.93 ngmL) and total equilin concentrations (Cmax 2.27 ngmL to 3.22 ngmL) and a decrease in circulating 17 estradiol concentrations (Cmax 0.037 ngmL to 0.030 ngmL). The halflife of the conjugated estrogens was similar with coadministration of PROMETRIUM Capsules. Table 2 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters. TABLE 2. Mean ( S.D.)

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>"CLINICAL STUDIES Effects on the endometrium In a randomized, doubleblind clinical trial, 358 postmenopausal women, each with an intact uterus, received treatment for up to 36 months. The treatment groups were PROMETRIUM Capsules at the dose of 200 mg per day for 12 days per 28day cycle in combination with conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg per day (n120) conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg per day only (n119) or placebo (n119). The subjects in all three treatment groups were primarily Caucasian women (87 percent or more of each group). The results for the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia in women receiving up to 3 years of treatment are shown in Table 3. A comparison of the PROMETRIUM Capsules plus conjugated estrogens treatment group to the conjugated estrogens only group showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia (6 percent combination product versus 64 percent estrogen alone) in the PROMETRIUM Capsules plus conjugated estrogens treatment group throughout 36 months of treatment.

Figure 1. Time to Hyperplasia in Women Receiving up to 36 Months of Treatment The discontinuation rates due to hyperplasia over the 36 months of treatment are as shown in Table 4. For any degree of hyperplasia, the discontinuation rate for patients who received conjugated estrogens plus PROMETRIUM Capsules was similar to that of the placebo only group, while the discontinuation rate for patients who received conjugated estrogens alone was significantly higher. Women who permanently discontinued treatment due to hyperplasia were similar in demographics to the overall study population. TABLE 4.

In a multicenter, parallelgroup, open label, postmarketing dosing study that included premenopausal women with secondary amenorrhea for at least 90 days, administration of 10 days of PROMETRIUM Capsules during two 28day treatment cycles, 300 mg per day (n107) or 400 mg per day (n99), resulted in 73.8 percent and 76.8 percent of women, respectively, experiencing withdrawal bleeding. The rate of secretory transformation was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, doubleblind clinical study in estrogenprimed postmenopausal women. PROMETRIUM Capsules administered orally for 10 days at 400 mg per day (n22) induced complete secretory changes in the endometrium in 45 percent of women compared to 0 percent in the placebo group (n23). A second multicenter, parallelgroup, open label postmarketing dosing study in premenopausal women with secondary amenorrhea for at least 90 days also evaluated the rate of secretory transformation. All subjects received daily oral conjugated estrogens over 3 consecutive 28day treatment cycles and PROMETRIUM Capsules, 300 mg per day (n107) or 400 mg per day (n99) for 10 days of each treatment cycle. The rate of complete secretory transformation was 21.5 percent and 28.3 percent, respectively. Womens Health Initiative Studies The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) 0.625 mgalone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), silent MI and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These sub studies did not evaluate the effects of CEalone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average followup of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the global index. The absolute excess risk of events in the global index was 19 per 10,000 womenyears. For those outcomes included in the WHI global index that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of followup, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 womenyears in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reductions per 10,000 womenyears were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the estrogen plus progestin substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 5. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average followup of 5.6 years. TABLE 5.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified for age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reducing risk of overall mortality hazard ratio (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.441.07). Womens Health Initiative Memory Study The estrogen plus progestin Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an ancillary study of WHI, enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average followup of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21  3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 per 10,000 womenyears. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimers disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis  Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to mice in two 78week studies at doses of 3, 10, 3020 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.85 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis) and 0.25, 2, 8 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.062 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis). Rats were dosed for 2 years at doses of 0.25, 1, 2.5, 4 mgkgday (males) and 0.25, 1, 4, 8 mgkgday (females) (equivalent to 0.132 and 0.134 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis, respectively). The incidence of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas was significantly increased in 1 mouse study in female mice dosed at 8 mgkgday (2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis). These tumors were not increased in another mouse study in females dosed at 10 or 3020 mgkgday (25 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2basis) in this study, there was a high incidence of early mortalities in males of the 3020 mgkgday group. The incidence of mammary gland adenomas and adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female mice dosed at 2 mgkgday and in female rats dosed at 4 mgkgday (0.5 and 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine elevated serum prolactin levels up to 4fold in rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in mammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin mediated. The relevance for human risk of the finding of prolactin mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) . Mutagenesis  No evidence of genotoxic potential for olanzapine was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes, induction of forward mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells, or in vivo sister chromatid exchange test in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters. Impairment of Fertility  In an oral fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, male mating performance, but not fertility, was impaired at a dose of 22.4 mgkgday and female fertility was decreased at a dose of 3 mgkgday (11 and 1.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis, respectively). Discontinuance of olanzapine treatment reversed the effects on male mating performance. In female rats, the precoital period was increased and the mating index reduced at 5 mgkgday (2.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis). Diestrous was prolonged and estrous delayed at 1.1 mgkgday (0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis) therefore olanzapine may produce a delay in ovulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C  In oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 18 mgkgday and in rabbits at doses up to 30 mgkgday (9 and 30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis, respectively) no evidence of teratogenicity was observed. In an oral rat teratology study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose of 18 mgkgday (9 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2basis). Gestation was prolonged at 10 mgkgday (5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2basis). In an oral rabbit teratology study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of 30 mgkgday (30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Placental transfer of olanzapine occurs in rat pups. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials with olanzapine in pregnant females. Seven pregnancies were observed during clinical trials with olanzapine, including 2 resulting in normal births, 1 resulting in neonatal death due to a cardiovascular defect, 3 therapeutic abortions, and 1 spontaneous abortion. Nonteratogenic Effects  Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including olanzapine), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Olanzapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Oral Administration, Monotherapy  Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentrations in approximately 6 hours following an oral dose. It is eliminated extensively by first pass metabolism, with approximately 40 of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Food does not affect the rate or extent of olanzapine absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that olanzapine tablets and olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets dosage forms of olanzapine are bioequivalent. Olanzapine displays linear kinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its halflife ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile mean of 30 hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 Lhr (5th to 95th percentile mean of 25 Lhr). Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steadystate concentrations in about 1 week that are approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, halflife, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age. Olanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000 L. It is 93 bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100 ngmL, binding primarily to albumin and 1acid glycoprotein. Metabolism and Elimination  Following a single oral dose of 14C labeled olanzapine, 7 of the dose of olanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57 and 30 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12 of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10Nglucuronide, present at steady state at 44 of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4Ndesmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31 of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed. Direct glucuronidation and cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavincontaining monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in vivo, because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme. Specific Populations Renal Impairment  Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7 of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of renal impairment on metabolite elimination has not been studied. Hepatic Impairment  Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (n6) with clinically significant (Childs Pugh Classification A and B) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. Geriatric  In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination halflife of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly (65 years) than in nonelderly subjects (65 years). Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, especially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism andor pharmacodynamic sensitivity see Dosage and Administration (2). Gender  Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30 lower in women than in men. There were, however, no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed. Smoking Status  Olanzapine clearance is about 40 higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications are not routinely recommended. Race  In vivo studies have shown that exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight differences. Dosage modifications for race are, therefore, not recommended. Combined Effects  The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences in populations. The clearance in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine see Dosage and Administration (2). Adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years)  In clinical studies, most adolescents were nonsmokers and this population had a lower average body weight, which resulted in higher average olanzapine exposure compared to adults.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risks of using olanzapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Diazepam May potentiate orthostatic hypotension. (7.1, 7.2) Alcohol May potentiate orthostatic hypotension. (7.1) Carbamazepine Increased clearance of olanzapine. (7.1) Fluvoxamine May increase olanzapine levels. (7.1) Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in Combination Also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax. (7.1) CNS Acting Drugs Caution should be used when taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. (7.2) Antihypertensive Agents Enhanced antihypertensive effect. (7.2) Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists May antagonize levodopadopamine agonists. (7.2) Other Concomitant Drug Therapy When using olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, refer to the Drug Interactions sections of the package insert for those products. (7.2) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Olanzapine Diazepam  The coadministration of diazepam with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine see Drug Interactions (7.2). Cimetidine and Antacids  Single doses of cimetidine (800 mg) or aluminum and magnesiumcontaining antacids did not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine. Inducers of CYP1A2  Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50 increase in the clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance. Alcohol  Ethanol (45 mg70 kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The coadministration of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine see Drug Interactions (7.2). Inhibitors of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine Fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine of 54 in female nonsmokers and 77 in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC is 52 and 108, respectively. Lower doses of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 FluoxetineFluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax. Warfarin  Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics see Drug Interactions (7.2). Inducers of CYP1A2 or Glucuronyl Transferase  Omeprazole and rifampin may cause an increase in olanzapine clearance. Charcoal  The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the Cmax and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose. 7.2 Potential for Olanzapine to Affect Other Drugs CNS Acting Drugs  Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when olanzapine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Antihypertensive Agents  Olanzapine, because of its potential for inducing hypotension, may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists  Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Lithium  Multiple doses of olanzapine (10 mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium see Warnings and Precautions(5.16). Valproate  Olanzapine (10 mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of valproate. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate see Warnings and Precautions (5.16). Effect of Olanzapine on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes  In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes. Imipramine  Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolite desipramine. Warfarin  Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin see Drug Interactions (7.1). Diazepam  Olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam or its active metabolite Ndesmethyldiazepam. However, diazepam coadministered with olanzapine increased the orthostatic hypotension observed with either drug given alone see Drug Interactions (7.1). Alcohol  Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of ethanol see Drug Interactions (7.1) Biperiden  Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of biperiden. Theophylline  Multiple doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline or its metabolites., 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Olanzapine Diazepam  The coadministration of diazepam with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine see Drug Interactions (7.2). Cimetidine and Antacids  Single doses of cimetidine (800 mg) or aluminum and magnesiumcontaining antacids did not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine. Inducers of CYP1A2  Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50 increase in the clearance of olanzapine.

There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or treatment. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if there is something you do not understand or you want to learn more about olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets. What is the most important information I should know about olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets? Olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets may cause serious side effects, including Increased risk of death in elderly people who are confused, have memory loss and have lost touch with reality (dementiarelated psychosis). High blood sugar (hyperglycemia). High fat levels in your blood (increased cholesterol and triglycerides), especially in teenagers age 13 to 17 or when used in combination with fluoxetine in children age 10 to 17. Weight gain, especially in teenagers age 13 to 17 or when used in combination with fluoxetine in children age 10 to 17. These serious side effects are described below. 1. Increased risk of death in elderly people who are confused, have memory loss and have lost touch with reality (dementiarelated psychosis). Olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets are not approved for treating psychosis in elderly people with dementia. 2. High blood sugar (hyperglycemia). High blood sugar can happen if you have diabetes already or if you have never had diabetes. High blood sugar could lead to  a build up of acid in your blood due to ketones (ketoacidosis)  coma  death Your doctor should do tests to check your blood sugar before you start taking olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets and during treatment.

Clinical Trials in Adults The information below for olanzapine is derived from a clinical trial database for olanzapine consisting of 8661 adult patients with approximately 4165 patientyears of exposure to oral olanzapine. This database includes (1) 2500 patients who participated in multipledose oral olanzapine premarketing trials in schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease representing approximately 1122 patientyears of exposure as of February 14, 1995 (2) 182 patients who participated in oral olanzapine premarketing bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials representing approximately 66 patientyears of exposure (3) 191 patients who participated in an oral olanzapine trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimers disease representing approximately 29 patientyears of exposure and (4) 5788 patients from 88 additional oral olanzapine clinical trials as of December 31, 2001. In addition, information from the premarketing 6week clinical study database for olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, consisting of 224 patients who participated in bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials with approximately 22 patientyears of exposure, is included below. The conditions and duration of treatment with olanzapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) openlabel and doubleblind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixeddose and dosetitration studies, and shortterm or longerterm exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analytes, ECGs, chest xrays, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Certain portions of the discussion below relating to objective or numeric safety parameters, namely, dosedependent adverse reactions, vital sign changes, weight gain, laboratory changes, and ECG changes are derived from studies in patients with schizophrenia and have not been duplicated for bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes). However, this information is also generally applicable to bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes). Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, MedDRA and COSTART Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. The reported reactions do not include those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not be repeated below. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions occurred during treatment with olanzapine, they were not necessarily caused by it. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of olanzapine. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reactions incidence in the population studied. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled and Combination Trials The following findings are based on premarketing trials of oral olanzapine for schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), a subsequent trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimers disease, and premarketing combination trials. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia  Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (5 for oral olanzapine vs 6 for placebo). However, discontinuations due to increases in ALT were considered to be drug related (2 for oral olanzapine vs 0 for placebo). Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Monotherapy  Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (2 for oral olanzapine vs 2 for placebo). Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm Combination Trials Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes), Olanzapine as Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate  In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 11 for the combination of oral olanzapine with lithium or valproate compared to 2 for patients who remained on lithium or valproate monotherapy. Discontinuations with the combination of oral olanzapine and lithium or valproate that occurred in more than 1 patient were somnolence (3), weight gain (1), and peripheral edema (1). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of oral olanzapine (incidence of 5 or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebotreated patients (olanzapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were Table 9  Common TreatmentEmergent Adverse Reactions Associated with the Use of Oral Olanzapine in 6Week Trials  SCHIZOPHRENIA Adverse Reaction Percentage of Patients Reporting Event Olanzapine (N248) Placebo (N118) Postural hypotension 5 2 Constipation 9 3 Weight gain 6 1 Dizziness 11 4 Personality disordera 8 4 Akathisia 5 1 a Personality disorder is the COSTART term for designating nonaggressive objectionable behavior.

Dystonia, Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, the frequency and severity are greater with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. In general, an elevated risk of acute dystonia may be observed in males and younger age groups receiving antipsychotics however, events of dystonia have been reported infrequently (1) with olanzapine use. Other Adverse Reactions The following table addresses dose relatedness for other adverse reactions using data from a schizophrenia trial involving fixed dosage ranges of oral olanzapine. It enumerates the percentage of patients with treatmentemergent adverse reactions for the 3 fixeddose range groups and placebo. The data were analyzed using the CochranArmitage test, excluding the placebo group, and the table includes only those adverse reactions for which there was a trend.

Laboratory Changes Olanzapine Monotherapy in AdultsAn assessment of the premarketing experience for olanzapine revealed an association with asymptomatic increases in ALT, AST, and GGT. Within the original premarketing database of about 2400 adult patients with baseline ALT 90 IUL, the incidence of ALT elevations to 200 IUL was 2 (502381). None of these patients experienced jaundice or other symptoms attributable to liver impairment and most had transient changes that tended to normalize while olanzapine treatment was continued. In placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adults, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from 3 times the upper limit of normal ULN at baseline to 3 times ULN) were observed in 5 (771426) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 1 (101187) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations 5 times ULN were observed in 2 (291438) of olanzapinetreated patients, compared to 0.3 (41196) of placebotreated patients. ALT values returned to normal, or were decreasing, at last followup in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine. No patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice, liver failure, or met the criteria for Hys Rule. Rare postmarketing reports of hepatitis have been received. Very rare cases of cholestatic or mixed liver injury have also been reported in the postmarketing period. Caution should be exercised in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment, in patients with preexisting conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve, and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Olanzapine administration was also associated with increases in serum prolactin see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , with an asymptomatic elevation of the eosinophil count in 0.3 of patients, and with an increase in CPK. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents In placebocontrolled clinical trials of adolescent patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), greater frequencies for the following treatmentemergent findings, at anytime, were observed in laboratory analytes compared to placebo elevated ALT (3X ULN in patients with ALT at baseline 3X ULN), (12 vs 2) elevated AST (28 vs 4) low total bilirubin (22 vs 7) elevated GGT (10 vs 1) and elevated prolactin (47 vs 7). In placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescents, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from 3 times ULN at baseline to 3 times ULN) were observed in 12 (22192) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 2 (2109) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations 5 times ULN were observed in 4 (8192) of olanzapinetreated patients, compared to 1 (1109) of placebotreated patients. ALT values returned to normal, or were decreasing, at last followup in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine. No adolescent patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice, liver failure, or met the criteria for Hys Rule. ECG Changes  In pooled studies of adults as well as pooled studies of adolescents, there were no significant differences between olanzapine and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc (Fridericia corrected), and PR intervals. Olanzapine use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo (adults 2.4 beats per minute vs no change with placebo adolescents 6.3 beats per minute vs 5.1 beats per minute with placebo). This increase in heart rate may be related to olanzapines potential for inducing orthostatic changes see Warnings and Precautions (5.8). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of olanzapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to olanzapine therapy include the following allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, pruritus or urticaria), diabetic coma, diabetic ketoacidosis, discontinuation reaction (diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting), jaundice, neutropenia, pancreatitis, priapism, rash, rhabdomyolysis, and venous thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis). Random cholesterol levels of 240 mgdL and random triglyceride levels of 1000 mgdL have been reported.", "6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Adults The information below for olanzapine is derived from a clinical trial database for olanzapine consisting of 8661 adult patients with approximately 4165 patientyears of exposure to oral olanzapine. This database includes (1) 2500 patients who participated in multipledose oral olanzapine premarketing trials in schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease representing approximately 1122 patientyears of exposure as of February 14, 1995 (2) 182 patients who participated in oral olanzapine premarketing bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials representing approximately 66 patientyears of exposure (3) 191 patients who participated in an oral olanzapine trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimers disease representing approximately 29 patientyears of exposure and (4) 5788 patients from 88 additional oral olanzapine clinical trials as of December 31, 2001. In addition, information from the premarketing 6week clinical study database for olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, consisting of 224 patients who participated in bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials with approximately 22 patientyears of exposure, is included below. The conditions and duration of treatment with olanzapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) openlabel and doubleblind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixeddose and dosetitration studies, and shortterm or longerterm exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analytes, ECGs, chest xrays, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Certain portions of the discussion below relating to objective or numeric safety parameters, namely, dosedependent adverse reactions, vital sign changes, weight gain, laboratory changes, and ECG changes are derived from studies in patients with schizophrenia and have not been duplicated for bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes). However, this information is also generally applicable to bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes). Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, MedDRA and COSTART Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. The reported reactions do not include those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not be repeated below. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions occurred during treatment with olanzapine, they were not necessarily caused by it. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of olanzapine. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reactions incidence in the population studied. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled and Combination Trials The following findings are based on premarketing trials of oral olanzapine for schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), a subsequent trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimers disease, and premarketing combination trials. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia  Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (5 for oral olanzapine vs 6 for placebo). However, discontinuations due to increases in ALT were considered to be drug related (2 for oral olanzapine vs 0 for placebo). Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Monotherapy  Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (2 for oral olanzapine vs 2 for placebo). Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm Combination Trials Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes), Olanzapine as Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate  In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 11 for the combination of oral olanzapine with lithium or valproate compared to 2 for patients who remained on lithium or valproate monotherapy. Discontinuations with the combination of oral olanzapine and lithium or valproate that occurred in more than 1 patient were somnolence (3), weight gain (1), and peripheral edema (1). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of oral olanzapine (incidence of 5 or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebotreated patients (olanzapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were Table 9  Common TreatmentEmergent Adverse Reactions Associated with the Use of Oral Olanzapine in 6Week Trials  SCHIZOPHRENIA Adverse Reaction Percentage of Patients Reporting Event Olanzapine (N248) Placebo (N118) Postural hypotension 5 2 Constipation 9 3 Weight gain 6 1 Dizziness 11 4 Personality disordera 8 4 Akathisia 5 1 a Personality disorder is the COSTART term for designating nonaggressive objectionable behavior.

Dystonia, Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, the frequency and severity are greater with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. In general, an elevated risk of acute dystonia may be observed in males and younger age groups receiving antipsychotics however, events of dystonia have been reported infrequently (1) with olanzapine use. Other Adverse Reactions The following table addresses dose relatedness for other adverse reactions using data from a schizophrenia trial involving fixed dosage ranges of oral olanzapine. It enumerates the percentage of patients with treatmentemergent adverse reactions for the 3 fixeddose range groups and placebo. The data were analyzed using the CochranArmitage test, excluding the placebo group, and the table includes only those adverse reactions for which there was a trend.

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.3 Dependence In studies prospectively designed to assess abuse and dependence potential, olanzapine was shown to have acute depressive CNS effects but little or no potential of abuse or physical dependence in rats administered oral doses up to 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (20 mg) and rhesus monkeys administered oral doses up to 8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis. Olanzapine has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic, and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNSactive drug will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of olanzapine (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of oral olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder were established in shortterm studies in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years). Use of olanzapine in adolescents is supported by evidence from adequate and wellcontrolled studies of olanzapine in which 268 adolescents received olanzapine in a range of 2.5 to 20 mgday see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2). Recommended starting dose for adolescents is lower than that for adults see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2). Compared to patients from adult clinical trials, adolescents were likely to gain more weight, experience increased sedation, and have greater increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, prolactin and hepatic aminotransferase levels see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6, 5.15, 5.17) and Adverse Reactions (6.2). When deciding among the alternative treatments available for adolescents, clinicians should consider the increased potential (in adolescents as compared with adults) for weight gain and hyperlipidemia. Clinicians should consider the potential longterm risks when prescribing to adolescents, and in many cases this may lead them to consider prescribing other drugs first in adolescents see Indications and Usage (1.1, 1.2). Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine in children 13 years of age have not been established see Patient Counseling Information (17.13) . Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in children  10 years of age have not been established. Safety and effectiveness information for pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) is approved for Eli Lilly and Companys olanzapine tablets and olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets.

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>"17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDAapproved Medication Guide for the oral formulations. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking olanzapine as monotherapy or in combination with fluoxetine. If you do not think you are getting better or have any concerns about your condition while taking olanzapine, call your doctor. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Patient Counseling Information section of the package insert for Symbyax. 17.1 Information on Medication Guide Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the potential benefits and potential risks associated with treatment with olanzapine, and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide is available for olanzapine. Prescribers or other health professionals should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Medication Guide for Symbyax. 17.2 Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Increased Mortality and Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with olanzapine had a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) compared with placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). 17.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Patients and caregivers should be counseled that a potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as NMS has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Signs and symptoms of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia) see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) . 17.4 Hyperglycemia Patients should be advised of the potential risk of hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions. Patients should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients who have diabetes should follow their doctors instructions about how often to check their blood sugar while taking olanzapine see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) . 17.5 Hyperlipidemia Patients should be counseled that hyperlipidemia has occurred during treatment with olanzapine. Patients should have their lipid profile monitored regularly see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . 17.6 Weight Gain Patients should be counseled that weight gain has occurred during treatment with olanzapine. Patients should have their weight monitored regularly see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) . 17.7 Orthostatic Hypotension Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic hypotension, especially during the period of initial dose titration and in association with the use of concomitant drugs that may potentiate the orthostatic effect of olanzapine, e.g., diazepam or alcohol see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Drug Interactions (7). Patients should be advised to change positions carefully to help prevent orthostatic hypotension, and to lie down if they feel dizzy or faint, until they feel better. Patients should be advised to call their doctor if they experience any of the following signs and symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension dizziness, fast or slow heart beat, or fainting. 17.8 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Because olanzapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that olanzapine therapy does not affect them adversely see Warnings and Precautions (5.12). 17.9 Body Temperature Regulation Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration. Patients should be advised to call their doctor right away if they become severely ill and have some or all of these symptoms of dehydration sweating too much or not at all, dry mouth, feeling very hot, feeling thirsty, not able to produce urine see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) . 17.10 Concomitant Medication Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, Symbyax. Patients should also be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, plan to take, or have stopped taking any prescription or overthecounter drugs, including herbal supplements, since there is a potential for interactions see Drug Interactions (7) . 17.11 Alcohol Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking olanzapine see Drug Interactions (7). 17.12 Phenylketonurics Olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (1.12, 2.24, 3.36, and 4.48 mg per 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg tablet, respectively) see Description (11). 17.13 Use in Specific Populations Pregnancy  Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with olanzapine see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . Nursing Mothers  Patients should be advised not to breastfeed an infant if they are taking olanzapine see Use in Specific Populations (8.3). Pediatric Use  Olanzapine is indicated for treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adolescents 13 to 17 years of age. Compared to patients from adult clinical trials, adolescents were likely to gain more weight, experience increased sedation, and have greater increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, prolactin, and hepatic aminotransferase levels. Patients should be counseled about the potential longterm risks associated with olanzapine and advised that these risks may lead them to consider other drugs first see Indications and Usage (1.1, 1.2). Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine in patients under 13 years of age have not been established. Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in patients  10 years of age have not been established see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Safety and effectiveness information for pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) is approved for Eli Lilly and Companys olanzapine tablets and olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets. However, due to Eli Lilly and Companys marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 17.14 Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program in Paediatric Patients Olanzapine is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for pediatric patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder that may include other measures (psychological, educational, social) for patients with the disorder. Effectiveness and safety of olanzapine have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Atypical antipsychotics are not intended for use in the pediatric patient who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors andor other primary psychiatric disorders.

(2.1) Olanzapine may be given without regard to meals. (2.1) Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in Combination Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should be made with the individual components according to efficacy and tolerability. (2.5) Olanzapine monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. (2.5) Safety of coadministration of doses above 18 mg olanzapine with 75 mg fluoxetine has not been evaluated in adults. (2.5) 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults Dose Selection  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mgday within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 5 mg QD are recommended. Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mgday in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mgday were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mgday dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mgday (i.e., to a dose of 15 mgday or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mgday. Dosing in Special Populations  The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g., nonsmoking female patients 65 years of age), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Maintenance Treatment  The effectiveness of oral olanzapine, 10 mgday to 20 mgday, in maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable on olanzapine for approximately 8 weeks and were then followed for relapse has been demonstrated in a placebocontrolled trial see Clinical Studies (14.1). The physician who elects to use olanzapine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Adolescents Dose Selection  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals with a recommended starting dose of 2.5 or 5 mg, with a target dose of 10 mgday. Efficacy in adolescents with schizophrenia was demonstrated based on a flexible dose range of 2.5 to 20 mgday in clinical trials, with a mean modal dose of 12.5 mgday (mean dose of 11.1 mgday). When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 2.5 or 5 mg are recommended. The safety and effectiveness of doses above 20 mgday have not been evaluated in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.1) . Maintenance Treatment  The efficacy of olanzapine for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in the adolescent population has not been systematically evaluated however, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. Thus, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. 2.2 Bipolar I Disorder ( Manic or Mixed Episodes) Adults Dose Selection for Monotherapy  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 10 or 15 mg. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours, reflecting the procedures in the placebocontrolled trials. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 5 mg QD are recommended. Shortterm (34 weeks) antimanic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mgday in clinical trials. The safety of doses above 20 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.2). Maintenance Monotherapy  The benefit of maintaining bipolar I patients on monotherapy with oral olanzapine at a dose of 5 to 20 mgday, after achieving a responder status for an average duration of 2 weeks, was demonstrated in a controlled trial see Clinical Studies (14.2). The physician who elects to use olanzapine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Dose Selection for Adjunctive Treatment  When administered as adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproate, oral olanzapine dosing should generally begin with 10 mg onceaday without regard to meals. Antimanic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mgday in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.2) . The safety of doses above 20 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Adolescents Dose Selection  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals with a recommended starting dose of 2.5 or 5 mg, with a target dose of 10 mgday. Efficacy in adolescents with bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) was demonstrated based on a flexible dose range of 2.5 to 20 mgday in clinical trials, with a mean modal dose of 10.7 mgday (mean dose of 8.9 mgday). When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 2.5 or 5 mg are recommended. The safety and effectiveness of doses above 20 mgday have not been evaluated in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.2) . Maintenance Treatment  The efficacy of olanzapine for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in the adolescent population has not been evaluated however, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. Thus, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. 2.3 Administration of Olanzapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets Peel back foil on blister. Do not push tablet through foil. Immediately upon opening the blister, using dry hands, remove tablet and place entire olanzapine orally disintegrating tablet in the mouth. Tablet disintegration occurs rapidly in saliva so it can be easily swallowed with or without liquid. 2.5 Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in Combination Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Clinical Studies section of the package insert for Symbyax. Adults Oral olanzapine should be administered in combination with fluoxetine once daily in the evening, without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 mg of oral olanzapine and 20 mg of fluoxetine. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, can be made according to efficacy and tolerability within dose ranges of oral olanzapine 5 to 12.5 mg and fluoxetine 20 to 50 mg. Antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in adult patients with a dose range of olanzapine 6 to 12 mg and fluoxetine 25 to 50 mg. Safety of coadministration of doses above 18 mg olanzapine with 75 mg fluoxetine has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Children and Adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) Dosage and Administration information for pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) is approved for Eli Lilly and Companys olanzapine tablets and olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets. However, due to Eli Lilly and Companys marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Safety and efficacy of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination was determined in clinical trials supporting approval of Symbyax (fixed dose combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine). Symbyax is dosed between 3 mg25 mg (olanzapinefluoxetine) per day and 12 mg50 mg (olanzapinefluoxetine) per day. The following table demonstrates the appropriate individual component doses of olanzapine and fluoxetine versus Symbyax. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should be made with the individual components according to efficacy and tolerability.

While there is no body of evidence to answer the question of how long a patient treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination should remain on it, it is generally accepted that bipolar I disorder, including the depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, is a chronic illness requiring chronic treatment. The physician should periodically reexamine the need for continued pharmacotherapy. Olanzapine monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. 2.7 Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in Combination Dosing in Special Populations The starting dose of oral olanzapine 2.5 to 5 mg with fluoxetine 20 mg should be used for patients with a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, patients with hepatic impairment, or patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may slow the metabolism of olanzapine or fluoxetine in combination (female gender, geriatric age, nonsmoking status), or those patients who may be pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may slow metabolism. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination have not been systematically studied in patients over 65 years of age or in patients under  10 years of age see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)., 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults Dose Selection  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mgday within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 5 mg QD are recommended. Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mgday in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mgday were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mgday dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mgday (i.e., to a dose of 15 mgday or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mgday. Dosing in Special Populations  The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g., nonsmoking female patients 65 years of age), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Maintenance Treatment  The effectiveness of oral olanzapine, 10 mgday to 20 mgday, in maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable on olanzapine for approximately 8 weeks and were then followed for relapse has been demonstrated in a placebocontrolled trial see Clinical Studies (14.1). The physician who elects to use olanzapine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Adolescents Dose Selection  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals with a recommended starting dose of 2.5 or 5 mg, with a target dose of 10 mgday. Efficacy in adolescents with schizophrenia was demonstrated based on a flexible dose range of 2.5 to 20 mgday in clinical trials, with a mean modal dose of 12.5 mgday (mean dose of 11.1 mgday). When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 2.5 or 5 mg are recommended. The safety and effectiveness of doses above 20 mgday have not been evaluated in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.1) . Maintenance Treatment  The efficacy of olanzapine for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in the adolescent population has not been systematically evaluated however, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. Thus, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment., 2.2 Bipolar I Disorder ( Manic or Mixed Episodes) Adults Dose Selection for Monotherapy  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 10 or 15 mg. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours, reflecting the procedures in the placebocontrolled trials. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 5 mg QD are recommended. Shortterm (34 weeks) antimanic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mgday in clinical trials. The safety of doses above 20 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.2). Maintenance Monotherapy  The benefit of maintaining bipolar I patients on monotherapy with oral olanzapine at a dose of 5 to 20 mgday, after achieving a responder status for an average duration of 2 weeks, was demonstrated in a controlled trial see Clinical Studies (14.2). The physician who elects to use olanzapine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Dose Selection for Adjunctive Treatment  When administered as adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproate, oral olanzapine dosing should generally begin with 10 mg onceaday without regard to meals. Antimanic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mgday in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.2) . The safety of doses above 20 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Adolescents Dose Selection  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals with a recommended starting dose of 2.5 or 5 mg, with a target dose of 10 mgday. Efficacy in adolescents with bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) was demonstrated based on a flexible dose range of 2.5 to 20 mgday in clinical trials, with a mean modal dose of 10.7 mgday (mean dose of 8.9 mgday). When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 2.5 or 5 mg are recommended. The safety and effectiveness of doses above 20 mgday have not been evaluated in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.2) . Maintenance Treatment  The efficacy of olanzapine for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in the adolescent population has not been evaluated however, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. Thus, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of olanzapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drugs efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. The mechanism of action of olanzapine in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Olanzapine binds with high affinity to the following receptors serotonin 5HT2A2C, 5HT6 (Ki4, 11, and 5 nM, respectively), dopamine D14 (Ki1131 nM), histamine H1 (Ki7 nM), and adrenergic 1 receptors (Ki19 nM). Olanzapine is an antagonist with moderate affinity binding for serotonin 5HT3 (Ki57 nM) and muscarinic M15 (Ki73, 96, 132, 32, and 48 nM, respectively). Olanzapine binds weakly to GABAA, BZD, and adrenergic receptors (Ki10 M). Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of olanzapine. Olanzapines antagonism of muscarinic M15 receptors may explain its anticholinergiclike effects. Olanzapines antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Olanzapines antagonism of adrenergic 1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Oral Administration, Monotherapy  Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentrations in approximately 6 hours following an oral dose. It is eliminated extensively by first pass metabolism, with approximately 40 of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Food does not affect the rate or extent of olanzapine absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that olanzapine tablets and olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets dosage forms of olanzapine are bioequivalent. Olanzapine displays linear kinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its halflife ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile mean of 30 hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 Lhr (5th to 95th percentile mean of 25 Lhr). Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steadystate concentrations in about 1 week that are approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, halflife, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age. Olanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000 L. It is 93 bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100 ngmL, binding primarily to albumin and 1acid glycoprotein. Metabolism and Elimination  Following a single oral dose of 14C labeled olanzapine, 7 of the dose of olanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57 and 30 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12 of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10Nglucuronide, present at steady state at 44 of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4Ndesmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31 of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed. Direct glucuronidation and cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavincontaining monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in vivo, because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme. Specific Populations Renal Impairment  Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7 of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of renal impairment on metabolite elimination has not been studied. Hepatic Impairment  Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (n6) with clinically significant (Childs Pugh Classification A and B) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. Geriatric  In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination halflife of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly (65 years) than in nonelderly subjects (65 years). Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, especially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism andor pharmacodynamic sensitivity see Dosage and Administration (2). Gender  Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30 lower in women than in men. There were, however, no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed. Smoking Status  Olanzapine clearance is about 40 higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications are not routinely recommended. Race  In vivo studies have shown that exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight differences. Dosage modifications for race are, therefore, not recommended. Combined Effects  The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences in populations. The clearance in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine see Dosage and Administration (2). Adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years)  In clinical studies, most adolescents were nonsmokers and this population had a lower average body weight, which resulted in higher average olanzapine exposure compared to adults."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Clinical Studies section of the package insert for Symbyax. 14.1 Schizophrenia Adults The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in 2 shortterm (6week) controlled trials of adult inpatients who met DSM IIIR criteria for schizophrenia. A single haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in 1 of the 2 trials, but this trial did not compare these 2 drugs on the full range of clinically relevant doses for both. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multiitem inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, 2 more recently developed scales were employed these included the 30item Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), in which are embedded the 18 items of the BPRS, and the Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS). The trial summaries below focus on the following outcomes PANSS total andor BPRS total BPRS psychosis cluster PANSS negative subscale or SANS and CGI Severity. The results of the trials follow (1) In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n149) involving 2 fixed olanzapine doses of 1 and 10 mgday (once daily schedule), olanzapine, at 10 mgday (but not at 1 mgday), was superior to placebo on the PANSS total score (also on the extracted BPRS total), on the BPRS psychosis cluster, on the PANSS Negative subscale, and on CGI Severity. (2) In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n253) involving 3 fixed dose ranges of olanzapine (5  2.5 mgday, 10  2.5 mgday, and 15  2.5 mgday) on a once daily schedule, the 2 highest olanzapine dose groups (actual mean doses of 12 and 16 mgday, respectively) were superior to placebo on BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score the highest olanzapine dose group was superior to placebo on the SANS. There was no clear advantage for the highdose group over the mediumdose group. (3) In a longerterm trial, adult outpatients (n326) who predominantly met DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia and who remained stable on olanzapine during openlabel treatment for at least 8 weeks were randomized to continuation on their current olanzapine doses (ranging from 10 to 20 mgday) or to placebo. The followup period to observe patients for relapse, defined in terms of increases in BPRS positive symptoms or hospitalization, was planned for 12 months, however, criteria were met for stopping the trial early due to an excess of placebo relapses compared to olanzapine relapses, and olanzapine was superior to placebo on time to relapse, the primary outcome for this study. Thus, olanzapine was more effective than placebo at maintaining efficacy in patients stabilized for approximately 8 weeks and followed for an observation period of up to 8 months. Examination of population subsets (race and gender) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings. Adolescents The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) was established in a 6week doubleblind, placebocontrolled, randomized trial of inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia (n107) who met diagnostic criteria according to DSMIVTR and confirmed by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged ChildrenPresent and Lifetime Version (KSADSPL). The primary rating instrument used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in this trial was the Anchored Version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRSC) total score. In this flexibledose trial, olanzapine 2.5 to 20 mgday (mean modal dose 12.5 mgday, mean dose of 11.1 mgday) was more effective than placebo in the treatment of adolescents diagnosed with schizophrenia, as supported by the statistically significantly greater mean reduction in BPRSC total score for patients in the olanzapine treatment group than in the placebo group. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with olanzapine should be maintained, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. It is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. 14.2 Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Adults Monotherapy  The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 shortterm (one 3week and one 4week) placebocontrolled trials in adult patients who met the DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapidcycling course. The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), an 11item clinicianrated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptiveaggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, languagethought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary outcome in these trials was change from baseline in the YMRS total score. The results of the trials follow (1) In one 3week placebocontrolled trial (n67) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5 to 20 mgday, once daily, starting at 10 mgday), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score. In an identically designed trial conducted simultaneously with the first trial, olanzapine demonstrated a similar treatment difference, but possibly due to sample size and site variability, was not shown to be superior to placebo on this outcome. (2) In a 4week placebocontrolled trial (n115) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5 to 20 mgday, once daily, starting at 15 mgday), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score. (3) In another trial, 361 patients meeting DSMIV criteria for a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder who had responded during an initial openlabel treatment phase for about 2 weeks, on average, to olanzapine 5 to 20 mgday were randomized to either continuation of olanzapine at their same dose (n225) or to placebo (n136), for observation of relapse. Approximately 50 of the patients had discontinued from the olanzapine group by day 59 and 50 of the placebo group had discontinued by day 23 of doubleblind treatment. Response during the openlabel phase was defined by having a decrease of the YMRS total score to 12 and HAMD 21 to 8. Relapse during the doubleblind phase was defined as an increase of the YMRS or HAMD 21 total score to 15, or being hospitalized for either mania or depression. In the randomized phase, patients receiving continued olanzapine experienced a significantly longer time to relapse. Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate  The efficacy of oral olanzapine with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 controlled trials in patients who met the DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapidcycling course. The results of the trials follow (1) In one 6week placebocontrolled combination trial, 175 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (YMRS 16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, in combination with their original therapy. Olanzapine (in a dose range of 5 to 20 mgday, once daily, starting at 10 mgday) combined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEqL to 1.2 mEqL or 50 gmL to 125 gmL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. (2) In a second 6week placebocontrolled combination trial, 169 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (YMRS 16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, in combination with their original therapy. Olanzapine (in a dose range of 5 to 20 mgday, once daily, starting at 10 mgday) combined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEqL to 1.2 mEqL or 50 gmL to 125 gmL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. Adolescents Acute Monotherapy  The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) was established in a 3week, doubleblind, placebocontrolled, randomized trial of adolescent inpatients and outpatients who met the diagnostic criteria for manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (with or without psychotic features) according to the DSMIVTR (n161). Diagnosis was confirmed by the KSADSPL. The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in this trial was the Adolescent Structured YoungMania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score. In this flexibledose trial, olanzapine 2.5 to 20 mgday (mean modal dose 10.7 mgday, mean dose of 8.9 mgday) was more effective than placebo in the treatment of adolescents with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, as supported by the statistically significantly greater mean reduction in YMRS total score for patients in the olanzapine treatment group than in the placebo group. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with olanzapine should be maintained, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients.

However, due to Eli Lilly and Companys marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C  In oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 18 mgkgday and in rabbits at doses up to 30 mgkgday (9 and 30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis, respectively) no evidence of teratogenicity was observed. In an oral rat teratology study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose of 18 mgkgday (9 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2basis). Gestation was prolonged at 10 mgkgday (5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2basis). In an oral rabbit teratology study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of 30 mgkgday (30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Placental transfer of olanzapine occurs in rat pups. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials with olanzapine in pregnant females. Seven pregnancies were observed during clinical trials with olanzapine, including 2 resulting in normal births, 1 resulting in neonatal death due to a cardiovascular defect, 3 therapeutic abortions, and 1 spontaneous abortion. Nonteratogenic Effects  Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including olanzapine), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Olanzapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of olanzapine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Parturition in rats was not affected by olanzapine. 8.3 Nursing Mothers In a study in lactating, healthy women, olanzapine was excreted in breast milk. Mean infant dose at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose. It is recommended that women receiving olanzapine should not breastfeed. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of oral olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder were established in shortterm studies in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years). Use of olanzapine in adolescents is supported by evidence from adequate and wellcontrolled studies of olanzapine in which 268 adolescents received olanzapine in a range of 2.5 to 20 mgday see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2). Recommended starting dose for adolescents is lower than that for adults see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2). Compared to patients from adult clinical trials, adolescents were likely to gain more weight, experience increased sedation, and have greater increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, prolactin and hepatic aminotransferase levels see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6, 5.15, 5.17) and Adverse Reactions (6.2). When deciding among the alternative treatments available for adolescents, clinicians should consider the increased potential (in adolescents as compared with adults) for weight gain and hyperlipidemia. Clinicians should consider the potential longterm risks when prescribing to adolescents, and in many cases this may lead them to consider prescribing other drugs first in adolescents see Indications and Usage (1.1, 1.2). Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine in children 13 years of age have not been established see Patient Counseling Information (17.13) . Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in children  10 years of age have not been established. Safety and effectiveness information for pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) is approved for Eli Lilly and Companys olanzapine tablets and olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets. However, due to Eli Lilly and Companys marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2500 patients in premarketing clinical studies with oral olanzapine, 11 (263) were 65 years of age or over. In patients with schizophrenia, there was no indication of any different tolerability of olanzapine in the elderly compared to younger patients. Studies in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile in this population compared to younger patients with schizophrenia. Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. In placebocontrolled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis. Also, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance or increase the pharmacodynamic response to olanzapine should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose for any geriatric patient see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Clinical studies of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>"13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis  Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to mice in two 78week studies at doses of 3, 10, 3020 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.85 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis) and 0.25, 2, 8 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.062 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis). Rats were dosed for 2 years at doses of 0.25, 1, 2.5, 4 mgkgday (males) and 0.25, 1, 4, 8 mgkgday (females) (equivalent to 0.132 and 0.134 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis, respectively). The incidence of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas was significantly increased in 1 mouse study in female mice dosed at 8 mgkgday (2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis). These tumors were not increased in another mouse study in females dosed at 10 or 3020 mgkgday (25 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2basis) in this study, there was a high incidence of early mortalities in males of the 3020 mgkgday group. The incidence of mammary gland adenomas and adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female mice dosed at 2 mgkgday and in female rats dosed at 4 mgkgday (0.5 and 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine elevated serum prolactin levels up to 4fold in rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in mammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin mediated. The relevance for human risk of the finding of prolactin mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) . Mutagenesis  No evidence of genotoxic potential for olanzapine was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes, induction of forward mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells, or in vivo sister chromatid exchange test in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters. Impairment of Fertility  In an oral fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, male mating performance, but not fertility, was impaired at a dose of 22.4 mgkgday and female fertility was decreased at a dose of 3 mgkgday (11 and 1.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis, respectively). Discontinuance of olanzapine treatment reversed the effects on male mating performance. In female rats, the precoital period was increased and the mating index reduced at 5 mgkgday (2.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis). Diestrous was prolonged and estrous delayed at 1.1 mgkgday (0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis) therefore olanzapine may produce a delay in ovulation. 13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology In animal studies with olanzapine, the principal hematologic findings were reversible peripheral cytopenias in individual dogs dosed at 10 mgkg (17 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis), doserelated decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils in mice, and lymphopenia in rats. A few dogs treated with 10 mgkg developed reversible neutropenia andor reversible hemolytic anemia between 1 and 10 months of treatment. Doserelated decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils were seen in mice given doses of 10 mgkg (equal to 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis) in studies of 3 months duration. Nonspecific lymphopenia, consistent with decreased body weight gain, occurred in rats receiving 22.5 mgkg (11 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis) for 3 months or 16 mgkg (8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis) for 6 or 12 months. No evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found in any of the species examined. Bone marrows were normocellular or hypercellular, indicating that the reductions in circulating blood cells were probably due to peripheral (nonmarrow) factors."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>WARNING INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIARELATED PSYCHOSIS Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.14) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) . When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Boxed Warning section of the package insert for Symbyax.

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience In premarketing trials involving more than 3100 patients andor normal subjects, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of olanzapine was identified in 67 patients. In the patient taking the largest identified amount, 300 mg, the only symptoms reported were drowsiness and slurred speech. In the limited number of patients who were evaluated in hospitals, including the patient taking 300 mg, there were no observations indicating an adverse change in laboratory analytes or ECG. Vital signs were usually within normal limits following overdoses. In postmarketing reports of overdose with olanzapine alone, symptoms have been reported in the majority of cases. In symptomatic patients, symptoms with 10 incidence included agitationaggressiveness, dysarthria, tachycardia, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma. Among less commonly reported symptoms were the following potentially medically serious reactions aspiration, cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiac arrhythmias (such as supraventricular tachycardia and 1 patient experiencing sinus pause with spontaneous resumption of normal rhythm), delirium, possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depressionarrest, convulsion, hypertension, and hypotension. Reports of fatality in association with overdose of olanzapine alone have been received. In 1 case of death, the amount of acutely ingested olanzapine was reported to be possibly as low as 450 mg of oral olanzapine however, in another case, a patient was reported to survive an acute olanzapine ingestion of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine. 10.2 Management of Overdose For current information on the management of olanzapine overdose, contact a certified poison control center (18002221222 or www.poison.org). The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, which may include intubation. Gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the Cmax and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose. The possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. There is no specific antidote to olanzapine. Therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be initiated. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids andor sympathomimetic agents. (Do not use epinephrine, dopamine, or other sympathomimetics with betaagonist activity, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of olanzapineinduced alpha blockade.) Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. For specific information about overdosage with lithium or valproate, refer to the Overdosage section of the package inserts for these products. For specific information about overdosage with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, refer to the Overdosage section of the Symbyax package insert., 10.1 Human Experience In premarketing trials involving more than 3100 patients andor normal subjects, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of olanzapine was identified in 67 patients.

<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>"12.2 Pharmacodynamics Olanzapine binds with high affinity to the following receptors serotonin 5HT2A2C, 5HT6 (Ki4, 11, and 5 nM, respectively), dopamine D14 (Ki1131 nM), histamine H1 (Ki7 nM), and adrenergic 1 receptors (Ki19 nM). Olanzapine is an antagonist with moderate affinity binding for serotonin 5HT3 (Ki57 nM) and muscarinic M15 (Ki73, 96, 132, 32, and 48 nM, respectively). Olanzapine binds weakly to GABAA, BZD, and adrenergic receptors (Ki10 M). Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of olanzapine. Olanzapines antagonism of muscarinic M15 receptors may explain its anticholinergiclike effects. Olanzapines antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Olanzapines antagonism of adrenergic 1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dependence</i>:</td><td>9.3 Dependence In studies prospectively designed to assess abuse and dependence potential, olanzapine was shown to have acute depressive CNS effects but little or no potential of abuse or physical dependence in rats administered oral doses up to 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (20 mg) and rhesus monkeys administered oral doses up to 8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm2 basis. Olanzapine has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic, and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNSactive drug will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of olanzapine (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert for Symbyax. Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Increased risk of death and increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack). (5.1) Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and in bipolar I disorder, and close supervision of highrisk patients should accompany drug therapy when using in combination with fluoxetine, also refer to the Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions sections of the package insert for Symbyax. (5.2) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring. (5.3) Hyperglycemia In some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients taking olanzapine. Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia and undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment. (5.4) Hyperlipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed. Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended, including fasting blood lipid testing at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment. (5.5) Weight Gain Potential consequences of weight gain should be considered. Patients should receive regular monitoring of weight. (5.6) Tardive Dyskinesia Discontinue if clinically appropriate. (5.7) Orthostatic Hypotension Orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia and, in some patients, syncope, may occur especially during initial dose titration. Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and those conditions that could affect hemodynamic responses. (5.8) Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis Has been reported with antipsychotics, including olanzapine. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low white blood cell count (WBC) or drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of olanzapine should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. (5.9) SeizuresUse cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. (5.11) Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Has potential to impair judgment, thinking, and motor skills. Use caution when operating machinery. (5.12) Hyperprolactinemia May elevate prolactin levels. (5.15) Use in Combination with Fluoxetine, Lithium or Valproate Also refer to the package inserts for Symbyax, lithium, or valproate. (5.16) Laboratory Tests Monitor fasting blood glucose and lipid profiles at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment. (5.17) 5.1 Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Increased Mortality  Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.14), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2). In placebocontrolled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapinetreated patients was significantly greater than placebotreated patients (3.5 vs 1.5, respectively). Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke  Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis. In placebocontrolled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.2). 5.2 Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and in bipolar I disorder, and close supervision of highrisk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for olanzapine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. 5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported see Patient Counseling Information (17.3). 5.4 Hyperglycemia Physicians should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100 to 126 mgdL, nonfasting 140 to 200 mgdL). Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients starting treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug see Patient Counseling Information (17.4). Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatmentemergent hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics. Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mgdL. In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mgdL. Placebotreated subjects (N19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mgdL. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  In an analysis of 5 placebocontrolled adult olanzapine monotherapy studies with a median treatment duration of approximately 3 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76 mgdL versus 0.17 mgdL). The difference in mean changes between olanzapine and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with antidiabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level 200 mgdL, andor a baseline fasting glucose level 126 mgdL). Olanzapinetreated patients had a greater mean HbA1c increase from baseline of 0.04 (median exposure 21 days), compared to a mean HbA1c decrease of 0.06 in placebotreated subjects (median exposure 17 days). In an analysis of 8 placebocontrolled studies (median treatment exposure 45 weeks), 6.1 of olanzapinetreated subjects (N855) had treatmentemergent glycosuria compared to 2.8 of placebotreated subjects (N599). Table 2 shows shortterm and longterm changes in fasting glucose levels from adult olanzapine monotherapy studies. Table 2 Changes in Fasting Glucose Levels from Adult Olanzapine Monotherapy Studies Up to 12 weeks exposure At least 48 weeks exposure Laboratory Analyte Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N Patients N Patients Fasting Glucose Normal to High (100 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 543 2.2 345 12.8 Placebo 293 3.4 NAa NAa Borderline to High (100 mgdL and  126 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 178 17.4 127 26.0 Placebo 96 11.5 NAa NAa a Not Applicable. The mean change in fasting glucose for patients exposed at least 48 weeks was 4.2 mgdL (N487). In analyses of patients who completed 9 to 12 months of olanzapine therapy, mean change in fasting and nonfasting glucose levels continued to increase over time. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents  The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescent patients, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change from baseline in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.68 mgdL versus 2.59 mgdL). The mean change in fasting glucose for adolescents exposed at least 24 weeks was 3.1 mgdL (N121). Table 3 shows shortterm and longterm changes in fasting blood glucose from adolescent olanzapine monotherapy studies. Table 3 Changes in Fasting Glucose Levels from Adolescent Olanzapine Monotherapy Studies Up to 12 weeks exposure At least 24 weeks exposure Laboratory Analyte Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N Patients N Patients Fasting Glucose Normal to High (100 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 124 0 108 0.9 Placebo 53 1.9 NAa NAa Borderline to High (100 mgdL and 126 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 14 14.3 13 23.1 Placebo 13 0 NAa NAa a Not Applicable. 5.5 Hyperlipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed with olanzapine use. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic followup lipid evaluations in patients using olanzapine, is recommended see Patient Counseling Information (17.5). Clinically significant, and sometimes very high (500 mgdL), elevations in triglyceride levels have been observed with olanzapine use. Modest mean increases in total cholesterol have also been seen with olanzapine use. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  In an analysis of 5 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapinetreated patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.3 mgdL, 3.0 mgdL, and 20.8 mgdL respectively compared to decreases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 6.1 mgdL, 4.3 mgdL, and 10.7 mgdL for placebotreated patients. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapinetreated patients and placebotreated patients. Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline, where lipid dysregulation was defined as patients diagnosed with dyslipidemia or related adverse reactions, patients treated with lipid lowering agents, or patients with high baseline lipid levels. In longterm studies (at least 48 weeks), patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.6 mgdL, 2.5 mgdL, and 18.7 mgdL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 0.16 mgdL. In an analysis of patients who completed 12 months of therapy, the mean nonfasting total cholesterol did not increase further after approximately 46 months. The proportion of patients who had changes (at least once) in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides from normal or borderline to high, or changes in HDL cholesterol from normal or borderline to low, was greater in longterm studies (at least 48 weeks) as compared with shortterm studies.

In phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), over a median exposure of 9.2 months, the mean increase in triglycerides in patients taking olanzapine was 40.5 mgdL. In phase 1 of CATIE, the mean increase in total cholesterol was 9.4 mgdL. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents  The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescents, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapinetreated adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 12.9 mgdL, 6.5 mgdL, and 28.4 mgdL, respectively, compared to increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol of 1.3 mgdL and 1.0 mgdL, and a decrease in triglycerides of 1.1 mgdL for placebotreated adolescents. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapinetreated adolescents and placebotreated adolescents. In longterm studies (at least 24 weeks), adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.5 mgdL, 5.4 mgdL, and 20.5 mgdL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 4.5 mgdL.

Patients receiving olanzapine should receive regular monitoring of weight see Patient Counseling Information (17.6) . Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  In an analysis of 13 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies, olanzapinetreated patients gained an average of 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) compared to an average 0.3 kg (0.6 lb) weight loss in placebotreated patients with a median exposure of 6 weeks 22.2 of olanzapinetreated patients gained at least 7 of their baseline weight, compared to 3 of placebotreated patients, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks 4.2 of olanzapinetreated patients gained at least 15 of their baseline weight, compared to 0.3 of placebotreated patients, with a median exposure to event of 12 weeks. Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.2 of olanzapinetreated patients and in 0 of placebotreated patients. In longterm studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) (median exposure of 573 days, N2021). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7, 15, or 25 of their baseline body weight with longterm exposure were 64, 32, and 12, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4 of olanzapinetreated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure. Table 6 includes data on adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified.

Mean increase in weight in adolescents was greater than in adults. In 4 placebocontrolled trials, discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 1 of olanzapinetreated patients, compared to 0 of placebotreated patients. Table 7 Weight Gain with Olanzapine Use in Adolescents from 4 PlaceboControlled Trials. Olanzapinetreated patients Placebotreated patients Mean change in body weight from baseline (median exposure  3 weeks) 4.6 kg (10.1 lb) 0.3 kg (0.7 lb) Percentage of patients who gained at least 7 of baseline body weight 40.6 (median exposure to 7  4 weeks) 9.8 (median exposure to 7  8 weeks) Percentage of patients who gained at least 15 of baseline body weight 7.1 (median exposure to 15  19 weeks) 2.7 (median exposure to 15  8 weeks) In longterm studies (at least 24 weeks), the mean weight gain was 11.2 kg (24.6 lb) (median exposure of 201 days, N179). The percentages of adolescents who gained at least 7, 15, or 25 of their baseline body weight with longterm exposure were 89, 55, and 29, respectively. Among adolescent patients, mean weight gain by baseline BMI category was 11.5 kg (25.3 lb), 12.1 kg (26.6 lb), and 12.7 kg (27.9 lb), respectively, for normal (N106), <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> (N26) and obese (N17). Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.2 of olanzapinetreated patients following at least 24 weeks of exposure. Table 8 shows data on adolescent weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 6 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified. Little clinical trial data is available on weight gain in adolescents with olanzapine beyond 6 months of treatment.

Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, olanzapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with olanzapine despite the presence of the syndrome. For specific information about the warnings of lithium or valproate, refer to the Warnings section of the package inserts for these other products. 5.8 Orthostatic Hypotension Olanzapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its 1adrenergic antagonistic properties see Patient Counseling Information (17.7). For oral olanzapine therapy, the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by initiating therapy with 5 mg QD see Dosage and Administration (2) . A more gradual titration to the target dose should be considered if hypotension occurs. Syncope was reported in 0.6 (152500) of olanzapinetreated patients in phase 23 oral olanzapine studies. The risk for this sequence of hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus pause may be greater in nonpsychiatric patients compared to psychiatric patients who are possibly more adapted to certain effects of psychotropic drugs. Olanzapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) where the occurrence of syncope, or hypotension andor bradycardia might put the patient at increased medical risk. Caution is necessary in patients who receive treatment with other drugs having effects that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression see Drug Interactions (7) . 5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis Class Effect  In clinical trial andor postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including olanzapine. Agranulocytosis has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of olanzapine should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm3) should discontinue olanzapine and have their WBC followed until recovery. 5.10 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimers disease. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimers disease. 5.11 Seizures During premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0.9 (222500) of olanzapinetreated patients. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimers dementia. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimers disease. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.12 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction associated with olanzapine treatment, occurring at an incidence of 26 in olanzapine patients compared to 15 in placebo patients. This adverse reaction was also dose related. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.4 (92500) of patients in the premarketing database. Since olanzapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that olanzapine therapy does not affect them adversely see Patient Counseling Information (17.8) . 5.13 Body Temperature Regulation Disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing olanzapine for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration see Patient Counseling Information (17.9). 5.14 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Olanzapine exhibits in vitro muscarinic receptor affinity. In premarketing clinical trials with olanzapine, olanzapine was associated with constipation, dry mouth, and tachycardia, all adverse reactions possibly related to cholinergic antagonism. Such adverse reactions were not often the basis for discontinuations from olanzapine, but olanzapine should be used with caution in patients with clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, narrow angle glaucoma, or a history of paralytic ileus or related conditions. In 5 placebocontrolled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis (n1184), the following treatmentemergent adverse reactions were reported in olanzapinetreated patients at an incidence of at least 2 and significantly greater than placebotreated patients falls, somnolence, peripheral edema, abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, lethargy, increased weight, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, dry mouth and visual hallucinations. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was greater with olanzapine than placebo (13 vs 7). Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) . Olanzapine has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Because of the risk of orthostatic hypotension with olanzapine, caution should be observed in cardiac patients see Warnings and Precautions (5.8). 5.15 Hyperprolactinemia As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, olanzapine elevates prolactin levels, and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactinelevating compounds. Longstanding hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. In placebocontrolled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 30 of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5 of adults treated with placebo. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 8136 adults treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrualrelated events1 (2 493240 of females), sexual functionrelated events2 (2 1508136 of females and males), and breastrelated events3 (0.7 233240 of females, 0.2 94896 of males). In placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescent patients (up to 6 weeks) with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 47 of olanzapinexadtreated patients compared to 7 of placebotreated patients. In a pooled analysis from clinical trials including 454 adolescents treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrualrelated events1 (1 2168 of females), sexual functionrelated events2 (0.7 3454 of females and males), and breastrelated events3 (2 3168 of females, 2 7286 of males) see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). 1 Based on a search of the following terms amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, menstruation delayed, and oligomenorrhea. 2 Based on a search of the following terms anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, loss of libido, abnormal orgasm, and sexual dysfunction. 3 Based on a search of the following terms breast discharge, enlargement or swelling, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and lactation disorder. 5.16 Use in Combination with Fluoxetine, Lithium, or Valproate When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, the prescriber should also refer to the Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert for Symbyax. When using olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, the prescriber should refer to the Warnings and Precautions sections of the package inserts for lithium or valproate see Drug Interactions (7). 5.17 Laboratory Tests Fasting blood glucose testing and lipid profile at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment is recommended see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5) and Patient Counseling Information (17.4, 17.5).", 5.1 Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Increased Mortality  Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.14), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2). In placebocontrolled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapinetreated patients was significantly greater than placebotreated patients (3.5 vs 1.5, respectively). Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke  Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis. In placebocontrolled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)., 5.2 Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and in bipolar I disorder, and close supervision of highrisk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for olanzapine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose., 5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)., 5.4 Hyperglycemia Physicians should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100 to 126 mgdL, nonfasting 140 to 200 mgdL). Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients starting treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug see Patient Counseling Information (17.4). Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatmentemergent hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics. Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mgdL. In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mgdL. Placebotreated subjects (N19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mgdL. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  In an analysis of 5 placebocontrolled adult olanzapine monotherapy studies with a median treatment duration of approximately 3 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76 mgdL versus 0.17 mgdL). The difference in mean changes between olanzapine and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with antidiabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level 200 mgdL, andor a baseline fasting glucose level 126 mgdL). Olanzapinetreated patients had a greater mean HbA1c increase from baseline of 0.04 (median exposure 21 days), compared to a mean HbA1c decrease of 0.06 in placebotreated subjects (median exposure 17 days). In an analysis of 8 placebocontrolled studies (median treatment exposure 45 weeks), 6.1 of olanzapinetreated subjects (N855) had treatmentemergent glycosuria compared to 2.8 of placebotreated subjects (N599). Table 2 shows shortterm and longterm changes in fasting glucose levels from adult olanzapine monotherapy studies. Table 2 Changes in Fasting Glucose Levels from Adult Olanzapine Monotherapy Studies Up to 12 weeks exposure At least 48 weeks exposure Laboratory Analyte Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N Patients N Patients Fasting Glucose Normal to High (100 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 543 2.2 345 12.8 Placebo 293 3.4 NAa NAa Borderline to High (100 mgdL and  126 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 178 17.4 127 26.0 Placebo 96 11.5 NAa NAa a Not Applicable. The mean change in fasting glucose for patients exposed at least 48 weeks was 4.2 mgdL (N487). In analyses of patients who completed 9 to 12 months of olanzapine therapy, mean change in fasting and nonfasting glucose levels continued to increase over time. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents  The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescent patients, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change from baseline in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.68 mgdL versus 2.59 mgdL). The mean change in fasting glucose for adolescents exposed at least 24 weeks was 3.1 mgdL (N121). Table 3 shows shortterm and longterm changes in fasting blood glucose from adolescent olanzapine monotherapy studies. Table 3 Changes in Fasting Glucose Levels from Adolescent Olanzapine Monotherapy Studies Up to 12 weeks exposure At least 24 weeks exposure Laboratory Analyte Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N Patients N Patients Fasting Glucose Normal to High (100 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 124 0 108 0.9 Placebo 53 1.9 NAa NAa Borderline to High (100 mgdL and 126 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 14 14.3 13 23.1 Placebo 13 0 NAa NAa a Not Applicable., 5.5 Hyperlipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed with olanzapine use. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic followup lipid evaluations in patients using olanzapine, is recommended see Patient Counseling Information (17.5). Clinically significant, and sometimes very high (500 mgdL), elevations in triglyceride levels have been observed with olanzapine use. Modest mean increases in total cholesterol have also been seen with olanzapine use. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  In an analysis of 5 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapinetreated patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.3 mgdL, 3.0 mgdL, and 20.8 mgdL respectively compared to decreases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 6.1 mgdL, 4.3 mgdL, and 10.7 mgdL for placebotreated patients. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapinetreated patients and placebotreated patients. Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline, where lipid dysregulation was defined as patients diagnosed with dyslipidemia or related adverse reactions, patients treated with lipid lowering agents, or patients with high baseline lipid levels. In longterm studies (at least 48 weeks), patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.6 mgdL, 2.5 mgdL, and 18.7 mgdL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 0.16 mgdL. In an analysis of patients who completed 12 months of therapy, the mean nonfasting total cholesterol did not increase further after approximately 46 months. The proportion of patients who had changes (at least once) in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides from normal or borderline to high, or changes in HDL cholesterol from normal or borderline to low, was greater in longterm studies (at least 48 weeks) as compared with shortterm studies.

In phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), over a median exposure of 9.2 months, the mean increase in triglycerides in patients taking olanzapine was 40.5 mgdL. In phase 1 of CATIE, the mean increase in total cholesterol was 9.4 mgdL. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents  The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescents, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapinetreated adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 12.9 mgdL, 6.5 mgdL, and 28.4 mgdL, respectively, compared to increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol of 1.3 mgdL and 1.0 mgdL, and a decrease in triglycerides of 1.1 mgdL for placebotreated adolescents. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapinetreated adolescents and placebotreated adolescents. In longterm studies (at least 24 weeks), adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.5 mgdL, 5.4 mgdL, and 20.5 mgdL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 4.5 mgdL.

Patients receiving olanzapine should receive regular monitoring of weight see Patient Counseling Information (17.6) . Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  In an analysis of 13 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies, olanzapinetreated patients gained an average of 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) compared to an average 0.3 kg (0.6 lb) weight loss in placebotreated patients with a median exposure of 6 weeks 22.2 of olanzapinetreated patients gained at least 7 of their baseline weight, compared to 3 of placebotreated patients, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks 4.2 of olanzapinetreated patients gained at least 15 of their baseline weight, compared to 0.3 of placebotreated patients, with a median exposure to event of 12 weeks. Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.2 of olanzapinetreated patients and in 0 of placebotreated patients. In longterm studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) (median exposure of 573 days, N2021). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7, 15, or 25 of their baseline body weight with longterm exposure were 64, 32, and 12, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4 of olanzapinetreated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure. Table 6 includes data on adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified.

The percentages of adolescents who gained at least 7, 15, or 25 of their baseline body weight with longterm exposure were 89, 55, and 29, respectively. Among adolescent patients, mean weight gain by baseline BMI category was 11.5 kg (25.3 lb), 12.1 kg (26.6 lb), and 12.7 kg (27.9 lb), respectively, for normal (N106), <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> (N26) and obese (N17). Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.2 of olanzapinetreated patients following at least 24 weeks of exposure. Table 8 shows data on adolescent weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 6 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified. Little clinical trial data is available on weight gain in adolescents with olanzapine beyond 6 months of treatment.

Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, olanzapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with olanzapine despite the presence of the syndrome. For specific information about the warnings of lithium or valproate, refer to the Warnings section of the package inserts for these other products., 5.8 Orthostatic Hypotension Olanzapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its 1adrenergic antagonistic properties see Patient Counseling Information (17.7). For oral olanzapine therapy, the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by initiating therapy with 5 mg QD see Dosage and Administration (2) . A more gradual titration to the target dose should be considered if hypotension occurs. Syncope was reported in 0.6 (152500) of olanzapinetreated patients in phase 23 oral olanzapine studies. The risk for this sequence of hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus pause may be greater in nonpsychiatric patients compared to psychiatric patients who are possibly more adapted to certain effects of psychotropic drugs. Olanzapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) where the occurrence of syncope, or hypotension andor bradycardia might put the patient at increased medical risk. Caution is necessary in patients who receive treatment with other drugs having effects that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression see Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

Given the primary CNS effects of quetiapine, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine. Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.) and decreased by the prototype CYP3A4 inducers (e.g, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. Johns wort etc.). Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure. The dose of quetiapine should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose if coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ). CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of quetiapine and phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5fold. Increased doses of quetiapine up to 5 fold may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other known potent CYP3A4 inducers see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.6 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ). When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine should be reduced to the original level within 7 to 14 days see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.6 ). The potential effects of several concomitant medications on quetiapine pharmacokinetics were studied see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ). Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, quetiapine may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Quetiapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. There are no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions of quetiapine on other drugs based on the CYP pathway. Quetiapine and its metabolites are noninhibitors of major metabolizing CYPs (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4)."</td></tr>

The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate tablets in schizophrenia was established in three 6week trials in adults and one 6week trial in adolescents (13 to 17 years). The effectiveness of quetiapine fumarate tablets for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1 ). Quetiapine fumarate tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was established in two 12week monotherapy trials in adults, in one 3week adjunctive trial in adults, and in one 3week monotherapy trial in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.2 ). Quetiapine fumarate tablets are indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Efficacy was established in two 8week monotherapy trials in adult patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorder see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.2 ). Quetiapine fumarate tablets are indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was established in two maintenance trials in adults. The effectiveness of quetiapine fumarate tablets as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.2 ). Pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders, however, diagnosis can be challenging. For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is indicated as part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions.</td></tr>

What is the most important information I should know about quetiapine fumarate tablets? Quetiapine fumarate tablets may cause serious side effects, including risk of death in the elderly with dementia. Medicines like quetiapine can increase the risk of death in elderly people who have memory loss (dementia). Quetiapine fumarate tablets are not for treating psychosis in the elderly with dementia. risk of suicidal thoughts or actions (antidepressant medicines, depression and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions). Talk to your or your family members healthcare provider about all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines. all treatment choices for depression or other serious mental illness. Antidepressant medications may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include people who have (or have a family history of) depression, bipolar illness (also called manicdepressive illness), or suicidal thoughts or actions. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member? Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed.

Adults The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine consisting of over 4300 patients. This database includes 698 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of bipolar depression, 405 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar mania (monotherapy and adjunct therapy), 646 patients exposed to quetiapine for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as adjunct therapy, and approximately 2600 patients andor normal subjects exposed to 1 or more doses of quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia. Of these approximately 4300 subjects, approximately 4000 (2300 in schizophrenia, 405 in acute bipolar mania, 698 in bipolar depression, and 646 for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder) were patients who participated in multiple dose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 2400 patientyears. The conditions and duration of treatment with quetiapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) openlabel and doubleblind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixeddose and dosetitration studies, and shortterm or longerterm exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm , PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia Overall, there was little difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (4 for quetiapine vs. 3 for placebo) in a pool of controlled trials. However, discontinuations due to somnolence (0.8 quetiapine vs. 0 placebo) and hypotension (0.4 quetiapine vs. 0 placebo) were considered to be drug related see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 and 5.18 ). Bipolar Disorder Mania Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 5.7 for quetiapine vs. 5.1 for placebo in monotherapy and 3.6 for quetiapine vs. 5.9 for placebo in adjunct therapy. Depression Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 12.3 for quetiapine 300 mg vs. 19.0 for quetiapine 600 mg and 5.2 for placebo. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm , PlaceboControlled Trials In the acute therapy of schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks) and bipolar mania (up to 12 weeks) trials, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine monotherapy (incidence of 5 or greater) and observed at a rate on quetiapine at least twice that of placebo were somnolence (18), dizziness (11), dry mouth (9), constipation (8), ALT increased (5), weight gain (5), and dyspepsia (5). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2 or More Among Quetiapine Treated Patients in ShortTerm , PlaceboControlled Trials The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied. Table 9 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy of schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks) and bipolar mania (up to 12 weeks) in 2 or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses ranging from 75 to 800 mgday) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm , PlaceboControlled Trials Doserelated Adverse Reactions Spontaneously elicited adverse reaction data from a study of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine (75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 750 mgday) to placebo were explored for doserelatedness of adverse reactions. Logistic regression analyses revealed a positive dose response (p0.05) for the following adverse reactions dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and weight gain. Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials with Quetiapine and Not Listed Elsewhere in the Label The following adverse reactions have also been reported with quetiapine nightmares, hypersensitivity and elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase (not associated with NMS), galactorrhea, bradycardia (which may occur at or near initiation of treatment and be associated with hypotension and or syncope) decreased platelets, somnambulism (and other related events), elevations in gammaGT levels, hypothermia, and priapism. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Four methods were used to measure EPS (1) SimpsonAngus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Global Assessment Score, (3) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (4) use of anticholinergic medications to treat emergent EPS. Adults Data from one 6week clinical trial of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine (75, 150, 300, 600, 750 mgday) provided evidence for the lack of treatmentemergent extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and doserelatedness for EPS associated with quetiapine treatment. Three methods were used to measure EPS (1) SimpsonAngus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (3) use of anticholinergic medications to treat emergent EPS. In Table 12, dystonic event included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, dystonia, muscle rigidity, oculogyration parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity, tremor, drooling, hypokinesia akathisia included akathisia, psychomotor agitation dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, choreoathetosis and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness, extrapyramidal disorder, movement disorder. Table 12 Adverse reactions associated with EPS in a shortterm, placebocontrolled multiple fixeddose Phase III schizophrenia trial (6 weeks duration) Preferred Term Quetiapine 75 mg  day ( N  53 ) Quetiapine 150 mg  day ( N  48 ) Quetiapine 300 mg  day ( N  52 ) Quetiapine 600 mg  day ( N  51 ) Quetiapine 750 mg  day ( N  54 ) Placebo ( N  51 ) n  n  n  n  n  n  Dystonic event 2 3.8 2 4.2 0 0.0 2 3.9 3 5.6 4 7.8 Parkinsonism 2 3.8 0 0.0 1 1.9 1 2.0 1 1.9 4 7.8 Akathisia 1 1.9 1 2.1 0 0.0 0 0.0 1 1.9 4 7.8 Dyskinetic event 2 3.8 0 0.0 0 0.0 1 2.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 Other extrapyramidal event 2 3.8 0 0.0 3 5.8 3 5.9 1 1.9 4 7.8 Parkinsonism incidence rates as measured by the SimpsonAngus total score for placebo and the five fixed doses (75, 150, 300, 600, 750 mgday) were 0.6 1.0, 1.2 1.6 1.8 and 1.8. The rate of anticholinergic medication use to treat emergent EPS for placebo and the five fixed doses was 14 11 10 8 12 and 11. In six additional placebocontrolled clinical trials (3 in acute mania and 3 in schizophrenia) using variable doses of quetiapine, there were no differences between the quetiapine and placebo treatment groups in the incidence of EPS, as assessed by SimpsonAngus total scores, spontaneous complaints of EPS and the use of concomitant anticholinergic medications to treat EPS. In two placebocontrolled clinical trials for the treatment of bipolar depression using 300 mg and 600 mg of quetiapine, the incidence of adverse reactions potentially related to EPS was 12 in both dose groups and 6 in the placebo group. In these studies, the incidence of the individual adverse reactions (akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dyskinesia, dystonia, restlessness, muscle contractions involuntary, psychomotor hyperactivity and muscle rigidity) were generally low and did not exceed 4 in any treatment group. The 3 treatment groups were similar in mean change in SAS total score and BARS Global Assessment score at the end of treatment. The use of concomitant anticholinergic medications was infrequent and similar across the three treatment groups. Children and Adolescents The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine consisting of over 1000 pediatric patients. This database includes 677 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and 393 children and adolescents (10 to 17 years old) exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm , PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapinetreated and placebotreated patients was 8.2 and 2.7, respectively. The adverse event leading to discontinuation in 1 or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo was somnolence (2.7 and 0 for placebo). Bipolar I Mania The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapinetreated and placebotreated patients was 11.4 and 4.4, respectively. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in 2 or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo were somnolence (4.1 vs. 1.1) and fatigue (2.1 vs. 0). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm , PlaceboControlled Trials In therapy for schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks), the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in adolescents (incidence of 5 or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (34), dizziness (12), dry mouth (7), tachycardia (7). In bipolar mania therapy (up to 3 weeks) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents (incidence of 5 or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (53), dizziness (18), fatigue (11), increased appetite (9), nausea (8), vomiting (8), tachycardia (7), dry mouth (7), and weight increased (6). In an acute (8week) quetiapine extendedrelease trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine extendedrelease (incidence of 5 or greater and at least twice that for placebo) were dizziness 7, diarrhea 5, fatigue 5 and nausea 5. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2 Among Quetiapine Treated Patients in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia (Adolescents, 13 to 17 years old) The following findings were based on a 6week placebocontrolled trial in which quetiapine was administered in either doses of 400 or 800 mgday. Table 13 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 6 weeks) of schizophrenia in 2 or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses of 400 or 800 mgday) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was at least twice the incidence in placebotreated patients. Adverse events that were potentially doserelated with higher frequency in the 800 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included dizziness (8 vs. 15), dry mouth (4 vs. 10), and tachycardia (6 vs. 11).

Bipolar I Mania (Children and Adolescents 10 to 17 years old) The following findings were based on a 3week placebocontrolled trial in which quetiapine was administered in either doses of 400 or 600 mgday. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions In bipolar mania therapy (up to 3 weeks) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents (incidence of 5 or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (53), dizziness (18), fatigue (11), increased appetite (9), nausea (8), vomiting (8), tachycardia (7), dry mouth (7), and weight increased (6). Table 14 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 3 weeks) of bipolar mania in 2 or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses of 400 or 600 mgday) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients. Adverse events that were potentially doserelated with higher frequency in the 600 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included somnolence (50 vs. 57), nausea (6 vs. 10) and tachycardia (6 vs. 9).

Extrapyramidal Symptoms In a shortterm placebocontrolled monotherapy trial in adolescent patients with schizophrenia (6week duration), the aggregated incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 12.9 (19147) for quetiapine and 5.3 (475) for placebo, though the incidence of the individual adverse events (akathisia, tremor, extrapyramidal disorder, hypokinesia, restlessness, psychomotor hyperactivity, muscle rigidity, dyskinesia) did not exceed 4.1 in any treatment group. In a shortterm placebocontrolled monotherapy trial in children and adolescent patients with bipolar mania (3week duration), the aggregated incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 3.6 (7193) or quetiapine and 1.1 (190) for placebo. Table 15 presents a listing of patients with adverse reactions potentially associated with extrapyramidal symptoms in the shortterm placebocontrolled monotherapy trial in adolescent patients with schizophrenia (6week duration). In Tables 15 and 16 dystonic event included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, and muscle rigidity parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity and tremor akathisia included akathisia only dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness and extrapyramidal disorder.

Transaminase Elevations Adults Asymptomatic, transient and reversible elevations in serum transaminases (primarily ALT) have been reported. In schizophrenia trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of 3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3 to 6week placebocontrolled trials were approximately 6 (29483) for quetiapine compared to 1 (3194) for placebo. In acute bipolar mania trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of 3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3 to 12week placebocontrolled trials were approximately 1 for both quetiapine (3560) and placebo (3294). These hepatic enzyme elevations usually occurred within the first 3 weeks of drug treatment and promptly returned to prestudy levels with ongoing treatment with quetiapine. In bipolar depression trials, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of 3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in two 8week placebocontrolled trials was 1 (5698) for quetiapine and 2 (6347) for placebo. Decreased Hemoglobin Adults In shortterm placebocontrolled trials, decreases in hemoglobin to 13 gdL males, 12 gdL females on at least one occasion occurred in 8.3 (5947155) of quetiapinetreated patients compared to 6.2 (2193536) of patients treated with placebo. In a database of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, decreases in hemoglobin to 13 gdL males, 12 gdL females on at least one occasion occurred in 11 (227720729) of quetiapinetreated patients. Interference with Urine Drug Screens There have been literature reports suggesting false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants in patients who have taken quetiapine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive urine drug screen results for these drugs, and confirmation by alternative analytical technique (e.g. chromatographic methods) should be considered. ECG Changes Adults Betweengroup comparisons for pooled placebocontrolled trials revealed no statistically significant quetiapineplacebo differences in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc, and PR intervals. However, the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia were compared in four 3 to 6week placebocontrolled clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia revealing a 1 (4399) incidence for quetiapine compared to 0.6 (1156) incidence for placebo. In acute (monotherapy) bipolar mania trials the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia was 0.5 (1192) for quetiapine compared to 0 (0178) incidence for placebo. In acute bipolar mania (adjunct) trials the proportions of patients meeting the same criteria was 0.6 (1166) for quetiapine compared to 0 (0171) incidence for placebo. In bipolar depression trials, no patients had heart rate increases to 120 beats per minute. Quetiapine use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 7 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute among placebo patients. This slight tendency to tachycardia in adults may be related to quetiapines potential for inducing orthostatic changes see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ). Children and Adolescents In the acute (6 week) schizophrenia trial in adolescents, increases in heart rate (110 bpm) occurred in 5.2 (373) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 8.5 (574) of patients receiving quetiapine 800 mg compared to 0 (075) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 3.8 bpm and 11.2 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 800 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 3.3 bpm in the placebo group see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ). In the acute (3 week) bipolar mania trial in children and adolescents, increases in heart rate (110 bpm) occurred in 1.1 (189) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 4.7 (485) of patients receiving quetiapine 600 mg compared to 0 (098) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 12.8 bpm and 13.4 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 1.7 bpm in the placebo group see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ). In an acute (8week) quetiapine extendedrelease trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, increases in heart rate (110 bpm 10 to 12 years and 13 to 17 years) occurred in 0 of patients receiving quetiapine extendedrelease and 1.2 of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 3.4 bpm for quetiapine extendedrelease, compared to 0.3 bpm in the placebo group see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ). The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval of quetiapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction which were temporally related to quetiapine therapy include anaphylactic reaction, cardiomyopathy, hyponatremia, myocarditis, nocturnal enuresis, pancreatitis, retrograde amnesia, rhabdomyolysis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), StevensJohnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS See FDAapproved patient labeling ( MEDICATION GUIDE ) Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with quetiapine and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for quetiapine. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking quetiapine. Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine is not approved for elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 ). Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a daytoday basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ). Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Patients should be advised to report to their physician any signs or symptoms that may be related to NMS. These may include muscle stiffness and high fever see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4 ). Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Patients should be aware of the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes, those with risk factors for diabetes, or those that develop these symptoms during treatment should have their blood glucose monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.5 ). Hyperlipidemia Patients should be advised that elevations in total cholesterol, LDLcholesterol and triglycerides and decreases in HDLcholesterol may occur. Patients should have their lipid profile monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.5 ). Weight Gain Patients should be advised that they may experience weight gain. Patients should have their weight monitored regularly see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.5 ). Orthostatic Hypotension Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic hypotension (symptoms include feeling dizzy or lightheaded upon standing, which may lead to falls), especially during the period of initial dose titration, and also at times of reinitiating treatment or increases in dose see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ). Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents Children and adolescent patients should have their blood pressure measured at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.8 ). LeukopeniaNeutropenia Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should be advised that they should have their CBC monitored while taking quetiapine see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.9 ). Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Patients should be advised of the risk of somnolence or sedation (which may lead to falls), especially during the period of initial dose titration. Patients should be cautioned about performing any activity requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating machinery, until they are reasonably certain quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.15 ). Heat Exposure and Dehydration Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.16 ). Concomitant Medication As with other medications, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or overthecounter drugs see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 ). Pregnancy and Nursing Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with quetiapine see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.1 ) and ( 8.3 ). Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program Quetiapine is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for adolescents with schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder that may include other measures (psychological, educational, and social). Effectiveness and safety of quetiapine have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age for schizophrenia or less than 10 years of age for bipolar mania. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. The decision to prescribe atypical antipsychotic medication will depend upon the physicians assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patients symptoms see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ( 1.3 ).

Consideration should be given to a slower rate of dose titration and a lower target dose in the elderly and in patients who are debilitated or who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ). When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Elderly patients should be started on quetiapine 50 mgday and the dose can be increased in increments of 50 mgday depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. Patients with hepatic impairment should be started on 25 mgday. The dose should be increased daily in increments of 25 mgday to 50 mgday to an effective dose, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patient. Quetiapine dose should be reduced to one sixth of original dose when comedicated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.). When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine should be increased by 6 fold see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 ). Quetiapine dose should be increased up to 5 fold of the original dose when used in combination with a chronic treatment (e.g., greater than 7 to 14 days) of a potent CYP3A4 inducer (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. Johns wort etc.). The dose should be titrated based on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine should be reduced to the original level within 7 to 14 days see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 ). Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that when restarting therapy of patients who have been off quetiapine for more than one week, the initial dosing schedule should be followed. When restarting patients who have been off quetiapine for less than one week, gradual dose escalation may not be required and the maintenance dose may be reinitiated. There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from antipsychotics to quetiapine, or concerning concomitant administration with antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients with schizophrenia from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate quetiapine therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing EPS medication should be reevaluated periodically."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of quetiapine in schizophrenia and its mood stabilizing properties in bipolar depression and mania are mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of quetiapine. Quetiapines antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Quetiapines antagonism of adrenergic 1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. Quetiapine is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2 (IC50s717 and 148 nM, respectively), dopamine D1 and D2 (IC50s1268 and 329 nM, respectively), histamine H1 (IC5030 nM), and adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors (IC50s94 and 271 nM, respectively). Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors (IC50s5000 nM). Effect on QT Interval In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine see OVERDOSAGE ( 10.1 ), in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval. Adults Quetiapine fumarate activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multipledose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are doseproportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal halflife of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steadystate concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Children and Adolescents At steadystate the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age), were similar to adults. However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and Cmax of the parent compound were 41 and 39 lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and Cmax were 45 and 31 higher, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.4 ). Absorption Quetiapine fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100 bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25 and 15, respectively. Distribution Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 104 Lkg. It is 83 bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. In vitro, quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine. Metabolism and Elimination Following a single oral dose of 14Cquetiapine, less than 1 of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73 and 20 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite Ndesalkyl quetiapine. Age Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40 in elderly patients (65 years, n9) compared to young patients (n12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.3 ). Gender There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Race There is no race effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Smoking Smoking has no effect on the oral clearance of quetiapine. Renal Insufficiency Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr10 to 30 mLmin1.73 m2, n8) had a 25 lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (Clcr 80 mLmin1.73 m2, n8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with renal insufficiency were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose. Dosage adjustment is therefore not needed in these patients see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.6 ). Hepatic Insufficiency Hepatically impaired patients (n8) had a 30 lower mean oral clearance of quetiapine than normal subjects. In two of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and Cmax were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects. Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.4 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.7 ). DrugDrug Interaction Studies The in vivo assessments of effect of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are summarized in Table 17 see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5 and 2.6 ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 ).

Quetiapine at doses of 750 mgday did not affect the single dose pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, lithium or lorazepam (Table 18) see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 ).

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL STUDIES Shortterm TrialsAdults The efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in 3 shortterm (6week) controlled trials of inpatients with schizophrenia who met DSM IIIR criteria for schizophrenia. Although a single fixed dose haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in one of the three trials, this single haloperidol dose group was inadequate to provide a reliable and valid comparison of quetiapine and haloperidol. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multiitem inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. The results of the trials follow In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n361) (study 1) involving 5 fixed doses of quetiapine (75 mgday, 150 mgday, 300 mgday, 600 mgday and 750 mgday given in divided doses three times per day), the 4 highest doses of quetiapine were generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster and the CGI severity score, with the maximal effect seen at 300 mgday, and the effects of doses of 150 mgday to 750 mgday were generally indistinguishable. In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n286) (study 2) involving titration of quetiapine in high (up to 750 mgday given in divided doses three times per day) and low (up to 250 mgday given in divided doses three times per day) doses, only the high dose quetiapine group (mean dose, 500 mgday) was superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. In a 6week dose and dose regimen comparison trial (n618) (study 3) involving two fixed doses of quetiapine (450 mgday given in divided doses both twice daily and three times daily and 50 mgday given in divided doses twice daily), only the 450 mgday (225 mg given twice daily) dose group was superior to the 50 mgday (25 mg given twice daily) quetiapine dose group on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. The primary efficacy results of these three studies in the treatment of schizophrenia in adults is presented in Table 19. Examination of population subsets (race, gender, and age) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of race or gender, with an apparently greater effect in patients under the age of 40 years compared to those older than 40. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Adolescents (Ages 13 to 17) The efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) was demonstrated in a 6week, doubleblind, placebocontrolled trial (study 4). Patients who met DSMIV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were randomized into one of three treatment groups quetiapine 400 mgday (n73), quetiapine 800 mgday (n74), or placebo (n75). Study medication was initiated at 50 mgday and on day 2 increased to 100 mgper day (divided and given two or three times per day). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to the target dose of 400 mgday or 800 mgday using increments of 100 mgday, divided and given two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Quetiapine at 400 mgday and 800 mgday was superior to placebo in the reduction of PANSS total score. The primary efficacy results of this study in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents are presented in Table 19.

Bipolar I disorder , manic or mixed episodes Adults The efficacy of quetiapine in the acute treatment of manic episodes was established in 3 placebocontrolled trials in patients who met DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and excluded patients with rapid cycling and mixed episodes. Of these trials, 2 were monotherapy (12 weeks) and 1 was adjunct therapy (3 weeks) to either lithium or divalproex. Key outcomes in these trials were change from baseline in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score at 3 and 12 weeks for monotherapy and at 3 weeks for adjunct therapy. Adjunct therapy is defined as the simultaneous initiation or subsequent administration of quetiapine with lithium or divalproex. The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was YMRS, an 11item clinicianrated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptiveaggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, languagethought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The results of the trials follow Monotherapy The efficacy of quetiapine in the acute treatment of bipolar mania was established in 2 placebocontrolled trials. In two 12week trials (n300, n299) comparing quetiapine to placebo, quetiapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of the YMRS total score at weeks 3 and 12. The majority of patients in these trials taking quetiapine were dosed in a range between 400 mgday and 800 mg per day (studies 1 and 2 in Table 20). Adjunct Therapy In this 3week placebocontrolled trial, 170 patients with bipolar mania (YMRS 20) were randomized to receive quetiapine or placebo as adjunct treatment to lithium or divalproex. Patients may or may not have received an adequate treatment course of lithium or divalproex prior to randomization. Quetiapine was superior to placebo when added to lithium or divalproex alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. (Study 3 in Table 20). The majority of patients in this trial taking quetiapine were dosed in a range between 400 mgday and 800 mg per day. In a similarly designed trial (n200), quetiapine was associated with an improvement in YMRS scores but did not demonstrate superiority to placebo, possibly due to a higher placebo effect. The primary efficacy results of these studies in the treatment of mania in adults is presented in Table 20. Children and Adolescents (Ages 10 to 17) The efficacy of quetiapine in the acute treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) was demonstrated in a 3week, doubleblind, placebocontrolled, multicenter trial (study 4 in Table 20). Patients who met DSMIV diagnostic criteria for a manic episode were randomized into one of three treatment groups quetiapine 400 mgday (n95), quetiapine 600 mgday (n98), or placebo (n91). Study medication was initiated at 50 mgday and on day 2 increased to 100 mgday (divided doses given two or three times daily). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to a target dose of 400 mgday or 600 mgday using increments of 100 mgday, given in divided doses two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total YMRS score. Quetiapine 400 mgday and 600 mgday were superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score (Table 20).

Bipolar Disorder , Depressive Episodes Adults The efficacy of quetiapine for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder was established in 2 identically designed 8week, randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled studies (N1045) (studies 5 and 6 in Table 21). These studies included patients with either bipolar I or II disorder and those with or without a rapid cycling course. Patients randomized to quetiapine were administered fixed doses of either 300 mg or 600 mg once daily. The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in these studies was the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10item clinicianrated scale with scores ranging from 0 to 60. The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. In both studies, quetiapine was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score. Improvement in symptoms, as measured by change in MADRS score relative to placebo, was seen in both studies at Day 8 (week 1) and onwards. In these studies, no additional benefit was seen with the 600 mg dose. For the 300 mg dose group, statistically significant improvements over placebo were seen in overall quality of life and satisfaction related to various areas of functioning, as measured using the QLESQ(SF). The primary efficacy results of these studies in the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adults is presented in Table 21.

Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Divalproex The efficacy of quetiapine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 placebocontrolled trials in patients (n1326) who met DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder (studies 7 and 8 in Figures 1 and 2). The trials included patients whose most recent episode was manic, depressed, or mixed, with or without psychotic features. In the openlabel phase, patients were required to be stable on quetiapine plus lithium or divalproex for at least 12 weeks in order to be randomized. On average, patients were stabilized for 15 weeks. In the randomization phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or divalproex and were randomized to receive either quetiapine (administered twice daily totaling 400 mgday to 800 mgday) or placebo. Approximately 50 of the patients had discontinued from the quetiapine group by day 280 and 50 of the placebo group had discontinued by day 117 of doubleblind treatment. The primary endpoint in these studies was time to recurrence of a mood event (manic, mixed or depressed episode). A mood event was defined as medication initiation or hospitalization for a mood episode YMRS score 20 or MADRS score 20 at 2 consecutive assessments or study discontinuation due to a mood event. (Figure 1 and Figure 2) In both studies, quetiapine was superior to placebo in increasing the time to recurrence of any mood event. The treatment effect was present for increasing time to recurrence of both manic and depressed episodes. The effect of quetiapine was independent of any specific subgroup (assigned mood stabilizer, sex, age, race, most recent bipolar episode, or rapid cycling course).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Limited human data. Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. Quetiapine should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. (8.1) Nursing Mothers Discontinue drug or nursing, taking into consideration importance of drug to mothers health (8.3) Pregnancy Category C Risk Summary There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of quetiapine use in pregnant women. In limited published literature, there were no major malformations associated with quetiapine exposure during pregnancy. In animal studies, embryofetal toxicity occurred. Quetiapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Human Data There are limited published data on the use of quetiapine for treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. In a prospective observational study, 21 women exposed to quetiapine and other psychoactive medications during pregnancy delivered infants with no major malformations. Among 42 other infants born to pregnant women who used quetiapine during pregnancy, there were no major malformations reported (one study of 36 women, 6 case reports). Due to the limited number of exposed pregnancies, these postmarketing data do not reliably estimate the frequency or absence of adverse outcomes. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including quetiapine), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Animal Data When pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to quetiapine during organogenesis, there was no teratogenic effect at doses up to 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for schizophrenia of 800 mgday based on mgm2 body surface area. However, there was evidence of embryofetal toxicity, which included delays in skeletal ossification occurring at approximately 1 and 2 times the MRHD of 800 mgday in both rats and rabbits, and an increased incidence of carpaltarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the MRHD. In addition, fetal weights were decreased in both species. Maternal toxicity (observed as decreased body weights andor death) occurred at 2 times the MRHD in rats and approximately 1 to 2 times the MRHD (all doses tested) in rabbits. In a peripostnatal reproductive study in rats, no drugrelated effects were observed when pregnant dams were treated with quetiapine at doses 0.01, 0.12, and 0.24 times the MRHD of 800 mgday based on mgm2 body surface area. However, in a preliminary peripostnatal study, there were increases in fetal and pup death, and decreases in mean litter weight at 3 times the MRHD. The effect of quetiapine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Quetiapine was excreted into human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from quetiapine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mothers health. In published case reports, the level of quetiapine in breast milk ranged from undetectable to 170 mcgL. The estimated infant dose ranged from 0.09 to 0.43 of the weightadjusted maternal dose. Based on a limited number (N8) of motherinfant pairs, calculated infant daily doses range from less than 0.01 mgkg (at a maternal daily dose up to 100 mg quetiapine) to 0.1 mgkg (at a maternal daily dose of 400 mg). In general, the adverse reactions observed in children and adolescents during the clinical trials were similar to those in the adult population with few exceptions. Increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in children and adolescents and did not occur in adults. Orthostatic hypotension occurred more frequently in adults (4 to 7) compared to children and adolescents (1) see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 ) and ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1 ). Schizophrenia The efficacy and safety of quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years were demonstrated in one 6week, doubleblind, placebocontrolled trial see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ( 1.1 ), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ), ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1 ), and CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1 ). Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age with schizophrenia have not been established. Maintenance The safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder has not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia has not been established in any patient population, including pediatric patients. Bipolar Mania The efficacy and safety of quetiapine in the treatment of mania in children and adolescents ages 10 to 17 years with Bipolar I disorder was demonstrated in a 3week, doubleblind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ( 1.2 ), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.3 ), ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1 ), and CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.2 ). Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age with bipolar mania have not been established. Bipolar Depression Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with bipolar depression have not been established. A clinical trial with quetiapine extendedrelease was conducted in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, efficacy was not established. Some differences in the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine were noted between childrenadolescents (10 to 17 years of age) and adults. When adjusted for weight, the AUC and Cmax of quetiapine were 41 and 39 lower, respectively, in children and adolescents compared to adults. The pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite, norquetiapine, were similar between childrenadolescents and adults after adjusting for weight see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ). Of the approximately 3700 patients in clinical studies with quetiapine, 7 (232) were 65 years of age or over. In general, there was no indication of any different tolerability of quetiapine in the elderly compared to younger adults. Nevertheless, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance, increase the pharmacodynamic response to quetiapine, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period in the elderly. The mean plasma clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 30 to 50 in elderly patients when compared to younger patients see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.3 ). Clinical experience with quetiapine in patients with renal impairment is limited see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ). Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in patients with hepatic impairment. In this population, a low starting dose of 25 mgday is recommended and the dose may be increased in increments of 25 mgday to 50 mgday see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.4 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in C57BL mice and Wistar rats. Quetiapine was administered in the diet to mice at doses of 20, 75, 250, and 750 mgkg and to rats by gavage at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mgkg for two years. These doses are equivalent to 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 times the maximum human dose (MRHD) of 800 mgday based on mgm2 body surface area (mice) or 0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD based on mgm2 body surface area (rats). There were statistically significant increases in thyroid gland follicular adenomas in male mice at doses 1.5 and 4.5 times the MRHD on mgm2 body surface area and in male rats at a dose of 3 times the MRHD on mgm2 body surface area. Mammary gland adenocarcinomas were statistically significantly increased in female rats at all doses tested (0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD on mgm2 body surface area). Thyroid follicular cell adenomas may have resulted from chronic stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) resulting from enhanced metabolism and clearance of thyroxine by rodent liver. Changes in TSH, thyroxine, and thyroxine clearance consistent with this mechanism were observed in subchronic toxicity studies in rat and mouse and in a 1year toxicity study in rat however, the results of these studies were not definitive. The relevance of the increases in thyroid follicular cell adenomas to human risk, through whatever mechanism, is unknown. Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum measurements in a 1year toxicity study showed that quetiapine increased median serum prolactin levels a maximum of 32 and 13fold in male and female rats, respectively. Increases in mammary neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and are considered to be prolactinmediated. The relevance of this increased incidence of prolactinmediated mammary gland tumors in rats to human risk is unknown see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.14 ). Mutagenesis The mutagenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the in vitro Ames bacterial gene mutation assay and in the in vitro mammalian gene mutation assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The clastogenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats up to 500 mgkg which is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on mgm2 body surface area. Based on weight of evidence quetiapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in these tests. Impairment of Fertility Quetiapine decreased mating and fertility in male SpragueDawley rats at oral doses of 50 and 150 mgkg or approximately 1 and 3 times the maximum human dose (MRHD) of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. Drugrelated effects included increases in interval to mate and in the number of matings required for successful impregnation. These effects continued to be observed at 3 times the MRHD even after a twoweek period without treatment. The noeffect dose for impaired mating and fertility in male rats was 25 mgkg, or 0.3 times the MRHD dose on mgm2 body surface area. Quetiapine adversely affected mating and fertility in female SpragueDawley rats at an oral dose approximately 1 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. Drugrelated effects included decreases in matings and in matings resulting in pregnancy, and an increase in the interval to mate. An increase in irregular estrus cycles was observed at doses of 10 and 50 mgkg, or approximately 0.1 and 1 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. The noeffect dose in female rats was 1 mgkg, or 0.01 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. Quetiapine caused a doserelated increase in pigment deposition in thyroid gland in rat toxicity studies which were 4 weeks in duration or longer and in a mouse 2year carcinogenicity study. Doses were 10 to 250 mgkg in rats and 75 to 750 mgkg in mice these doses are 0.1 to 3, and 0.1 to 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area, respectively. Pigment deposition was shown to be irreversible in rats. The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be colocalized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells. The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown. In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1 month, focal triangular cataracts occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mgkg, or 4 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a doserelated reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeatdose dog and monkey studies however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs. The appearance of delta8cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25 reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs. Drugrelated cataracts have not been seen in any other species however, in a 1year study in monkeys, a striated appearance of the anterior lens surface was detected in 27 females at a dose of 225 mgkg or 5.5 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>"OVERDOSAGE In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported reactions. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drugs known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension. Patients with preexisting severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.11 ). One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In postmarketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose. There were also very rare reports of overdose of quetiapine alone resulting in death or coma. In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QTprolonging effects when administered in patients with acute overdosage of quetiapine. Similarly it is reasonable to expect that the alphaadrenergicblocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of quetiapine, resulting in problematic hypotension. There is no specific antidote to quetiapine. Therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be instituted. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids andor sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of quetiapineinduced alpha blockade). In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g. stroke, transient ischemic attack) has been seen in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs (5.3) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring (5.4) Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with metabolic changes. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain (5.5) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Monitor patients for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended, including fasting blood lipid testing at the beginning of, and periodically, during treatment Weight Gain Gain in body weight has been observed clinical monitoring of weight is recommended Tardive Dyskinesia Discontinue if clinically appropriate (5.6) Hypotension Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease (5.7) Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents Monitor blood pressure at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment in children and adolescents (5.8) Leukopenia , Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Monitor complete blood count frequently during the first few months of treatment in patients with a preexisting low white cell count or a history of leukopenianeutropenia and discontinue quetiapine at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors (5.9) Cataracts Lens changes have been observed in patients during longterm quetiapine treatment. Lens examination is recommended when starting treatment and at 6month intervals during chronic treatment (5.10) Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see BOXED WARNING . Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression andor the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a longstanding concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of shortterm placebocontrolled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Shortterm studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 shortterm trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 shortterm trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drugplacebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2. Table 2 DrugPlacebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Age Range Drug  Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo 18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case 65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longerterm use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebocontrolled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression andor the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for quetiapine fumarate tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixedmanic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including quetiapine, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. In placebocontrolled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebotreated subjects. Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see also BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 ). A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemiadiabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose, and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these metabolic profiles should be managed as clinically appropriate. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatmentemergent hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

The mean change in fasting glucose from baseline was 3.2 mgdL and mean change in 2 hour glucose from baseline was 1.8 mgdL for quetiapine. In 2 longterm placebocontrolled randomized withdrawal clinical trials for bipolar I disorder maintenance, mean exposure of 213 days for quetiapine (646 patients) and 152 days for placebo (680 patients), the mean change in glucose from baseline was 5.0 mgdL for quetiapine and 0.05 mgdL for placebo. The exposureadjusted rate of any increased blood glucose level (126 mgdL) for patients more than 8 hours since a meal (however, some patients may not have been precluded from calorie intake from fluids during fasting period) was 18.0 per 100 patient years for quetiapine (10.7 of patients n556) and 9.5 for placebo per 100 patient years (4.6 of patients n581). Children and Adolescents In a placebocontrolled quetiapine monotherapy study of adolescent patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia (6 weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose levels for quetiapine (n138) compared to placebo (n67) was 0.75 mgdL versus 1.70 mgdL. In a placebocontrolled quetiapine monotherapy study of children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania (3 weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose level for quetiapine (n170) compared to placebo (n81) was 3.62 mgdL versus 1.17 mgdL. No patient in either study with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (100 mgdL) or a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (100 mgdL and 126 mgdL) had a treatmentemergent blood glucose level of 126 mgdL. In a placebocontrolled quetiapine extendedrelease monotherapy study (8 weeks duration) of children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the mean change in fasting glucose levels for quetiapine extendedrelease (n60) compared to placebo (n62) was 1.8 mgdL versus 1.6 mgdL. In this study, there were no patients in the quetiapine extendedrelease or placebotreated groups with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (100 mgdL) that had an increase in blood glucose level 126 mgdL. There was one patient in the quetiapine extendedrelease group with a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (100 mgdL) and (126 mgdL) who had an increase in blood glucose level of 126 mgdL compared to zero patients in the placebo group.

Weight Gain Increases in weight have been observed in clinical trials. Patients receiving quetiapine should receive regular monitoring of weight. Adults In clinical trials with quetiapine the following increases in weight have been reported.

Table 7 Proportion of Patients with Weight Gain 7 of Body Weight (Children and Adolescents) Vital Sign Indication Treatment Arm N Patients n () Schizophrenia Quetiapine 111 23 (21) Placebo 44 3 (7) Weight Gain  7  of Body Weight Bipolar Mania Quetiapine 157 18 (12) Placebo 68 0 (0) 6 weeks duration 3 weeks duration The mean change in body weight in the schizophrenia trial was 2.0 kg in the quetiapine group and 0.4 kg in the placebo group and in the bipolar mania trial it was 1.7 kg in the quetiapine group and 0.4 kg in the placebo group. In an openlabel study that enrolled patients from the above two pediatric trials, 63 of patients (241380) completed 26 weeks of therapy with quetiapine. After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean increase in body weight was 4.4 kg. Fortyfive percent of the patients gained 7 of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. In order to adjust for normal growth over 26 weeks an increase of at least 0.5 standard deviation from baseline in BMI was used as a measure of a clinically significant change 18.3 of patients on quetiapine met this criterion after 26 weeks of treatment. In a clinical trial for quetiapine extendedrelease in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the percentage of patients with weight gain 7 of body weight at any time was 15 (1492) for quetiapine extendedrelease vs. 10 (10100) for placebo. The mean change in body weight was 1.4 kg in the quetiapine extendedrelease group vs. 0.6 kg in the placebo group. When treating pediatric patients with quetiapine for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected for normal growth. A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, quetiapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on quetiapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with quetiapine despite the presence of the syndrome. Quetiapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its 1adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 1 (283265) of the patients treated with quetiapine, compared with 0.2 (2954) on placebo and about 0.4 (2527) on active control drugs. Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope may lead to falls. Quetiapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia and treatment with antihypertensive medications). The risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 25 mg twice daily see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ). If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration schedule is appropriate. In placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (6week duration) or bipolar mania (3week duration), the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (20 mmHg) was 15.2 (51335) for quetiapine and 5.5 (9163) for placebo the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (10 mmHg) was 40.6 (136335) for quetiapine and 24.5 (40163) for placebo. In the 26week openlabel clinical trial, one child with a reported history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis. Blood pressure in children and adolescents should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment. In a placebocontrolled quetiapine extendedrelease clinical trial (8 weeks duration) in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (20 mmHg) was 6.5 (692) for quetiapine extendedrelease and 6.0 (6100) for placebo the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (10 mmHg) was 46.7 (4392) for quetiapine extendedrelease and 36.0 (36100) for placebo. In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to atypical antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue quetiapine at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm3) should discontinue quetiapine and have their WBC followed until recovery. The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ( 13.2 ). Lens changes have also been observed in adults, children and adolescents during longterm quetiapine treatment, but a causal relationship to quetiapine use has not been established. Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as slit lamp exam or other appropriately sensitive methods, is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6month intervals during chronic treatment. In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine see OVERDOSAGE ( 10.1 ), in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 ). The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone). Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes andor sudden death including (1) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g. cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure and heart hypertrophy). During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.5 (203490) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 0.2 (2954) on placebo and 0.7 (4527) on active control drugs. As with other antipsychotics, quetiapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimers dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. Adults Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated doserelated decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine (T4) of approximately 20 at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T4, irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear. If there is an effect on the hypothalamicpituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patients thyroid status. Therefore, both TSH and free T4, in addition to clinical assessment, should be measured at baseline and at followup. In the mania adjunct studies, where quetiapine was added to lithium or divalproex, 12 (24196) of quetiapine treated patients compared to 7 (15203) of placebotreated patients had elevated TSH levels. Of the quetiapine treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 3 had simultaneous low free T4 levels (free T4 0.8 LLN). About 0.7 (263489) of quetiapine patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment. In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of significant shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH were1 decrease in free T4 (free T4 0.8 LLN), 2.0 (35717513) decrease in total T4, 4.0 (751861) decrease in free T3, 0.4 (5313766) decrease in total T3, 2.0 (261312), and increase in TSH, 4.9 (95619412). In eight patients, where TBG was measured, levels of TBG were unchanged. 1 Based on shifts from normal baseline to potentially clinically important value at anytime postbaseline. Shifts in total T4, free T4, total T3 and free T3 are defined as 0.8 x LLN (pmolL) and shift in TSH is 5 mIUL at any time. Table 8 shows the incidence of these shifts in shortterm placebocontrolled clinical trials. Table 8 Incidence of shifts in thyroid hormone levels and TSH in short term placebocontrolled clinical trials1,2 Total T4 Free T4 Total T3 Free T3 TSH Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo 3.4 (371097) 0.6 (4651) 0.7 (527218) 0.1 (43668) 0.5 (2369) 0.0 (0113) 0.2 (115673) 0.0 (12679) 3.2 (2407587) 2.7 (1053912) 1Based on shifts from normal baseline to potentially clinically important value at anytime postbaseline. Shifts in total T4, free T4, total T3 and free T3 are defined as 0.8 x LLN (pmolL) and shift in TSH is 5 mIUL at any time. 2 Includes quetiapine and quetiapine extendedrelease data. In shortterm placebocontrolled monotherapy trials, the incidence of reciprocal, shifts in T3 and TSH was 0.0  for both quetiapine (14800) and placebo (02190) and for T4 and TSH the shifts were 0.1 (76154) for quetiapine versus 0.0 (13007) for placebo. Children and Adolescents In acute placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescent patients with schizophrenia (6week duration) or bipolar mania (3week duration), the incidence of shifts for thyroid function values at any time for quetiapine treated patients and placebotreated patients for elevated TSH was 2.9 (8280) vs. 0.7 (1138), respectively and for decreased total thyroxine was 2.8 (8289) vs. 0 (0145, respectively). Of the quetiapine treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 1 had simultaneous low free T4 level at end of treatment. Adults During clinical trials with quetiapine, the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a clinically significant value occurred in 3.6 (1584416) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 2.6 (511968) on placebo. Children and Adolescents In acute placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescent patients with bipolar mania (3week duration) or schizophrenia (6week duration), the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a value (20 mcgL males 26 mcgL females at any time) was 13.4 (18134) for quetiapine compared to 4 (375) for placebo in males and 8.7 (9104) for quetiapine compared to 0 (039) for placebo in females. Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, quetiapine elevates prolactin levels in some patients and the elevation may persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactinelevating compounds. Longstanding hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ( 13.1 ). Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse event reported in patients treated with quetiapine especially during the 3 to 5 day period of initial dosetitration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 18 (89510) of patients on quetiapine compared to 11 (22206) of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine as monotherapy, somnolence was reported in 16 (34209) of patients on quetiapine compared to 4 of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine as adjunct therapy, somnolence was reported in 34 (66196) of patients on quetiapine compared to 9 (19203) of placebo patients. In bipolar depression trials, somnolence was reported in 57 (398698) of patients on quetiapine compared to 15 (51347) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls. Although not reported with quetiapine, disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing quetiapine for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration. Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimers dementia. Quetiapine and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. In shortterm placebocontrolled, monotherapy clinical trials with quetiapine extendedrelease that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1 (2411993) for quetiapine extendedrelease and 6.7 (711065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse events (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness and irritability) did not exceed 5.3 in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1 week postdiscontinuation. Gradual withdrawal is advised."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in C57BL mice and Wistar rats. Quetiapine was administered in the diet to mice at doses of 20, 75, 250, and 750 mgkg and to rats by gavage at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mgkg for two years. These doses are equivalent to 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 times the maximum human dose (MRHD) of 800 mgday based on mgm2 body surface area (mice) or 0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD based on mgm2 body surface area (rats). There were statistically significant increases in thyroid gland follicular adenomas in male mice at doses 1.5 and 4.5 times the MRHD on mgm2 body surface area and in male rats at a dose of 3 times the MRHD on mgm2 body surface area. Mammary gland adenocarcinomas were statistically significantly increased in female rats at all doses tested (0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD on mgm2 body surface area). Thyroid follicular cell adenomas may have resulted from chronic stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) resulting from enhanced metabolism and clearance of thyroxine by rodent liver. Changes in TSH, thyroxine, and thyroxine clearance consistent with this mechanism were observed in subchronic toxicity studies in rat and mouse and in a 1year toxicity study in rat however, the results of these studies were not definitive. The relevance of the increases in thyroid follicular cell adenomas to human risk, through whatever mechanism, is unknown. Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum measurements in a 1year toxicity study showed that quetiapine increased median serum prolactin levels a maximum of 32 and 13fold in male and female rats, respectively. Increases in mammary neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and are considered to be prolactinmediated. The relevance of this increased incidence of prolactinmediated mammary gland tumors in rats to human risk is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.14). Mutagenesis The mutagenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the in vitro Ames bacterial gene mutation assay and in the in vitro mammalian gene mutation assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The clastogenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats up to 500 mgkg which is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on mgm2 body surface area. Based on weight of evidence quetiapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in these tests. Impairment of Fertility Quetiapine decreased mating and fertility in male SpragueDawley rats at oral doses of 50 and 150 mgkg or approximately 1 and 3 times the maximum human dose (MRHD) of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. Drugrelated effects included increases in interval to mate and in the number of matings required for successful impregnation. These effects continued to be observed at 3 times the MRHD even after a twoweek period without treatment. The noeffect dose for impaired mating and fertility in male rats was 25 mgkg, or 0.3 times the MRHD dose on mgm2 body surface area. Quetiapine adversely affected mating and fertility in female SpragueDawley rats at an oral dose approximately 1 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. Drugrelated effects included decreases in matings and in matings resulting in pregnancy, and an increase in the interval to mate. An increase in irregular estrus cycles was observed at doses of 10 and 50 mgkg, or approximately 0.1 and 1 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm 2 body surface area. The noeffect dose in female rats was 1 mgkg, or 0.01 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Risk Summary There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of quetiapine use in pregnant women. In limited published literature, there were no major malformations associated with quetiapine exposure during pregnancy. In animal studies, embryofetal toxicity occurred. Quetiapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Human Data There are limited published data on the use of quetiapine for treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. In a prospective observational study, 21 women exposed to quetiapine and other psychoactive medications during pregnancy delivered infants with no major malformations. Among 42 other infants born to pregnant women who used quetiapine during pregnancy, there were no major malformations reported (one study of 36 women, 6 case reports). Due to the limited number of exposed pregnancies, these postmarketing data do not reliably estimate the frequency or absence of adverse outcomes. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including quetiapine), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Animal Data When pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to quetiapine during organogenesis, there was no teratogenic effect at doses up to 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for schizophrenia of 800 mgday based on mgm2 body surface area. However, there was evidence of embryofetal toxicity, which included delays in skeletal ossification occurring at approximately 1 and 2 times the MRHD of 800 mgday in both rats and rabbits, and an increased incidence of carpaltarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the MRHD. In addition, fetal weights were decreased in both species. Maternal toxicity (observed as decreased body weights andor death) occurred at 2 times the MRHD in rats and approximately 1 to 2 times the MRHD (all doses tested) in rabbits. In a peripostnatal reproductive study in rats, no drugrelated effects were observed when pregnant dams were treated with quetiapine at doses 0.01, 0.12, and 0.24 times the MRHD of 800 mgday based on mgm2 body surface area. However, in a preliminary peripostnatal study, there were increases in fetal and pup death, and decreases in mean litter weight at 3 times the MRHD.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Quetiapine fumarate activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multipledose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are doseproportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal halflife of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steadystate concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Children and Adolescents At steadystate the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age), were similar to adults. However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and Cmax of the parent compound were 41 and 39 lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and Cmax were 45 and 31 higher, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Absorption Quetiapine fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100 bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25 and 15, respectively. Distribution Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 104 Lkg. It is 83 bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. In vitro, quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine. Metabolism and Elimination Following a single oral dose of 14Cquetiapine, less than 1 of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73 and 20 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite Ndesalkyl quetiapine. Age Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40 in elderly patients ( 65 years, n9) compared to young patients (n12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary see Dosage and Administration (2.3). Gender There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Race There is no race effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Smoking Smoking has no effect on the oral clearance of quetiapine. Renal Insufficiency Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr10 to 30 mLmin1.73 m2, n8) had a 25 lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (Clcr  80 mLmin1.73 m2, n8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with renal insufficiency were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose. Dosage adjustment is therefore not needed in these patients.see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) . Hepatic Insufficiency Hepatically impaired patients (n8) had a 30 lower mean oral clearance of quetiapine than normal subjects. In two of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and Cmax were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects. Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed see Dosage and Administration(2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) . DrugDrug Interaction Studies The in vivo assessments of effect of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are summarized in Table 17 see Dosage and Administration (2.5 and 2.6) and Drug Interactions (7.1) . Table 17 The Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Quetiapine Coadministered drug Dose schedules Effect on quetiapine pharmacokinetics Coadministered drug Quetiapine Phenytoin 100 mg three times daily 250 mg three times daily 5 fold Increase in oral clearance Divalproex 500 mg twice daily 150 mg twice daily 17 increase mean max plasma concentration at steady state.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors Reduce quetiapine dose to one sixth when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) (2.5, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers Increase quetiapine dose up to 5 fold when used in combination with a chronic treatment (more than 7 to 14 days) of potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, St. Johns wort) (2.6, 7.1, 12.3) Discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers Reduce quetiapine dose by 5 fold within 7 to 14 days of discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers (2.6, 7.1, 12.3) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Quetiapine The risks of using quetiapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of quetiapine, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine. Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.). and decreased by the prototype CYP3A4 inducers (e..g, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. Johns wort etc.). Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors. CYP3A4 inhibitors Coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure. The dose of quetiapine should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose if coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . CYP3A4 inducers Coadministration of quetiapine and phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5fold. Increased doses of quetiapine up to 5 fold may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other known potent CYP3A4 inducers see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine should be reduced to the original level within 7 to 14 days see Dosage and Administration (2.6) . The potential effects of several concomitant medications on quetiapine pharmacokinetics were studied see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  7.2 Effect of Quetiapine on Other Drugs Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, quetiapine may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Quetiapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. There are no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions of quetiapine on other drugs based on the CYP pathway. Quetiapine and its metabolites are noninhibitors of major metabolizing CYPs (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4).</td></tr>

The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate tablets in schizophrenia was established in three 6week trials in adults and one 6week trial in adolescents (13 to 17 years). The effectiveness of quetiapine fumarate tablets for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. see Clinical Studies (14.1) 1.2 Bipolar Disorder Quetiapine fumarate tablet is indicated for the acute treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was established in two 12week monotherapy trials in adults, in one 3week adjunctive trial in adults, and in one 3week monotherapy trial in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) see Clinical Studies (14.2). Quetiapine fumarate tablet is indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Efficacy was established in two 8week monotherapy trials in adult patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorder see Clinical Studies (14.2). Quetiapine fumarate tablet is indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was established in two maintenance trials in adults. The effectiveness of quetiapine fumarate tablets as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. see Clinical Studies (14.2). 1.3 Special Considerations in Treating Pediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder Pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders, however, diagnosis can be challenging. For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is indicated as part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions.</td></tr>

Bipolar Mania The efficacy and safety of quetiapine in the treatment of mania in children and adolescents ages 10 to 17 years with Bipolar I disorder was demonstrated in a 3week, doubleblind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial. see Indications and Usage (1.2), Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.2). Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age with bipolar mania have not been established Bipolar Depression Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with bipolar depression have not been established. A clinical trial with quetiapine extended release was conducted in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, efficacy was not established. Some differences in the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine were noted between childrenadolescents (10 to 17 years of age) and adults. When adjusted for weight, the AUC and Cmax of quetiapine were 41 and 39 lower, respectively, in children and adolescents compared to adults. The pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite, norquetiapine, were similar between childrenadolescents and adults after adjusting for weight see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>"17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDAapproved patient labeling (Medication Guide) Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with quetiapine and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions is available for quetiapine. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking quetiapine. Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine is not approved for elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1). Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a daytoday basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2). Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Patients should be advised to report to their physician any signs or symptoms that may be related to NMS. These may include muscle stiffness and high fever seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4). Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Patients should be aware of the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes, those with risk factors for diabetes, or those that develop these symptoms during treatment should have their blood glucose monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment seeWarnings and Precautions (5.5). Hyperlipidemia Patients should be advised that elevations in total cholesterol, LDLcholesterol and triglycerides and decreases in HDLcholesterol may occur. Patients should have their lipid profile monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment seeWarnings and Precautions (5.5). Weight Gain Patients should be advised that they may experience weight gain. Patients should have their weight monitored regularly seeWarnings and Precautions (5.5). Orthostatic Hypotension Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic hypotension (symptoms include feeling dizzy or lightheaded upon standing, which may lead to falls), especially during the period of initial dose titration, and also at times of reinitiating treatment or increases in dose seeWarnings and Precautions (5.7). Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents Children and adolescent patients should have their blood pressure measured at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment  seeWarnings and Precautions (5.8). LeukopeniaNeutropenia Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should be advised that they should have their CBC monitored while taking quetiapine see Warnings and Precautions (5.9). Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Patients should be advised of the risk of somnolence or sedation (which may lead to falls), especially during the period of initial dose titration. Patients should be cautioned about performing any activity requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating machinery, until they are reasonably certain quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. see Warnings and Precautions (5.15). Heat Exposure and Dehydration Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration see Warnings and Precautions (5.16). Concomitant Medication As with other medications, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or overthecounter drugs see Drug Interactions (7.1)). Pregnancy and Nursing Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with quetiapine. seeUse in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3). Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program Quetiapine is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for adolescents with schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder that may include other measures (psychological, educational, and social). Effectiveness and safety of quetiapine have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age for schizophrenia or less than 10 years of age for bipolar mania. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. The decision to prescribe atypical antipsychotic medication will depend upon the physicians assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patients symptoms see Indications and Usage (1.3) Manufactured For Accord Healthcare, Inc., 1009 Slater Road, Suite 210B, Durham, NC 27703, USA.

Generally, in the maintenance phase, patients continued on the same dose on which they were stabilized. 400 to 800 mgday 800 mgday 1NA Not applicable Maintenance Treatment for Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder Maintenance Treatment  Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment see Clinical Studies (14.2). 2.3 Dose Modifications in Elderly Patients Consideration should be given to a slower rate of dose titration and a lower target dose in the elderly and in patients who are debilitated or who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Elderly patients should be started on quetiapine fumarate tablets 50 mgday and the dose can be increased in increments of 50 mgday depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. 2.4 Dose Modifications in Hepatically Impaired Patients Patients with hepatic impairment should be started on 25 mgday. The dose should be increased daily in increments of 25 mgday to 50 mgday to an effective dose, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patient. 2.5 Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inhibitors Quetiapine fumarate tablets dose should be reduced to one sixth of original dose when comedicated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.). When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine fumarate tablets should be increased by 6 fold see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1). 2.6 Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inducers Quetiapine fumarate tablets dose should be increased up to 5 fold of the original dose when used in combination with a chronic treatment (e.g., greater than 7 to 14 days) of a potent CYP3A4 inducer (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. Johns wort etc.). The dose should be titrated based on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine fumarate tablets should be reduced to the original level within 7 to 14 days see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1). 2.7 Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that when restarting therapy of patients who have been off quetiapine fumarate tablets for more than one week, the initial dosing schedule should be followed. When restarting patients who have been off quetiapine fumarate tablets for less than one week, gradual dose escalation may not be required and the maintenance dose may be reinitiated. 2.8 Switching from Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from antipsychotics to quetiapine fumarate tablets, or concerning concomitant administration with antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients with schizophrenia from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate quetiapine fumarate tablets therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing EPS medication should be reevaluated periodically.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>"12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of quetiapine in schizophrenia and its mood stabilizing properties in bipolar depression and mania are mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of quetiapine. Quetiapines antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Quetiapines antagonism of adrenergic 1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug."</td></tr>

Adults  The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine consisting of over 4300 patients. This database includes 698 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of bipolar depression, 405 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar mania (monotherapy and adjunct therapy), 646 patients exposed to quetiapine for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as adjunct therapy, and approximately 2600 patients andor normal subjects exposed to 1 or more doses of quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia. Of these approximately 4300 subjects, approximately 4000 (2300 in schizophrenia, 405 in acute bipolar mania, 698 in bipolar depression, and 646 for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder) were patients who participated in multiple dose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 2400 patientyears. The conditions and duration of treatment with quetiapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) openlabel and doubleblind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixeddose and dosetitration studies, and shortterm or longerterm exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia Overall, there was little difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (4 for quetiapine vs. 3 for placebo) in a pool of controlled trials. However, discontinuations due to somnolence (0.8 quetiapine vs. 0 placebo) and hypotension (0.4 quetiapine vs. 0 placebo) were considered to be drug related see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 and 5.18). Bipolar Disorder Mania Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 5.7 for quetiapine vs. 5.1 for placebo in monotherapy and 3.6 for quetiapine vs. 5.9 for placebo in adjunct therapy. Depression Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 12.3 for quetiapine 300 mg vs. 19.0 for quetiapine 600 mg and 5.2 for placebo. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials In the acute therapy of schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks) and bipolar mania (up to 12 weeks) trials, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine monotherapy (incidence of 5 or greater) and observed at a rate on quetiapine at least twice that of placebo were somnolence (18), dizziness (11), dry mouth (9), constipation (8), ALT increased (5), weight gain (5), and dyspepsia (5). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2 or More Among Quetiapine Treated Patients in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied. Table 9 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy of schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks) and bipolar mania (up to 12 weeks) in 2 or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses ranging from 75 to 800 mgday) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients.

Table 10 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 3 weeks) of acute mania in 2 or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses ranging from 100 to 800 mgday) used as adjunct therapy to lithium and divalproex where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Doserelated Adverse Reactions Spontaneously elicited adverse reaction data from a study of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine (75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 750 mgday) to placebo were explored for doserelatedness of adverse reactions. Logistic regression analyses revealed a positive dose response (p0.05) for the following adverse reactions dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and weight gain. Adverse Reactions in clinical trials with quetiapine and not listed elsewhere in the label The following adverse reactions have also been reported with quetiapine nightmares, hypersensitivity and elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase (not associated with NMS), galactorrhea, bradycardia (which may occur at or near initiation of treatment and be associated with hypotension and or syncope) decreased platelets, somnambulism (and other related events), elevations in gammaGT levels, hypothermia, and priapism. Extrapyramidal Symptoms(EPS) Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Four methods were used to measure EPS (1) SimpsonAngus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Global Assessment Score, (3) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (4) use of anticholinergic medications to treat emergent EPS. Adults Data from one 6week clinical trial of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine (75, 150, 300, 600, 750 mgday) provided evidence for the lack of treatmentemergent extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and doserelatedness for EPS associated with quetiapine treatment. Three methods were used to measure EPS (1) SimpsonAngus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (3) use of anticholinergic medications to treat emergent EPS. In Table 12, dystonic event included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, dystonia, muscle rigidity, oculogyration parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity, tremor, drooling, hypokinesia akathisia included akathisia, psychomotor agitation dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, choreoathetosis and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness, extrapyramidal disorder, movement disorder.

The rate of anticholinergic medication use to treat emergent EPS for placebo and the five fixed doses was 14 11 10 8 12 and 11. In six additional placebocontrolled clinical trials (3 in acute mania and 3 in schizophrenia) using variable doses of quetiapine, there were no differences between the quetiapine and placebo treatment groups in the incidence of EPS, as assessed by SimpsonAngus total scores, spontaneous complaints of EPS and the use of concomitant anticholinergic medications to treat EPS. In two placebocontrolled clinical trials for the treatment of bipolar depression using 300 mg and 600 mg of quetiapine, the incidence of adverse reactions potentially related to EPS was 12 in both dose groups and 6 in the placebo group. In these studies, the incidence of the individual adverse reactions (akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dyskinesia, dystonia, restlessness, muscle contractions involuntary, psychomotor hyperactivity and muscle rigidity) were generally low and did not exceed 4 in any treatment group. The 3 treatment groups were similar in mean change in SAS total score and BARS Global Assessment score at the end of treatment. The use of concomitant anticholinergic medications was infrequent and similar across the three treatment groups. Children and Adolescents The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine consisting of over 1000 pediatric patients. This database includes 677 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and 393 children and adolescents (10 to 17 years old) exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapinetreated and placebotreated patients was 8.2 and 2.7, respectively. The adverse event leading to discontinuation in 1 or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo was somnolence (2.7 and 0 for placebo). Bipolar I Mania The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapinetreated and placebotreated patients was 11.4 and 4.4, respectively. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in 2 or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo were somnolence (4.1 vs. 1.1) and fatigue (2.1 vs. 0). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials In therapy for schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks), the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in adolescents (incidence of 5 or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (34), dizziness (12), dry mouth (7), tachycardia (7). In bipolar mania therapy (up to 3 weeks) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents (incidence of 5 or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (53), dizziness (18), fatigue (11), increased appetite (9), nausea (8), vomiting (8), tachycardia (7), dry mouth (7), and weight increased (6). In an acute (8week) quetiapine extended release trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine extended release (incidence of 5 or greater and at least twice that for placebo) were dizziness 7, diarrhea 5, fatigue 5 and nausea 5. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of  2 Among Quetiapine Treated Patients in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia (Adolescents, 13 to 17 years old) The following findings were based on a 6week placebocontrolled trial in which quetiapine was administered in either doses of 400 or 800 mgday. Table 13 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 6weeks) of schizophrenia in 2 or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses of 400 or 800 mgday) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was at least twice the incidence in placebotreated patients. Adverse events that were potentially doserelated with higher frequency in the 800 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included dizziness (8 vs. 15), dry mouth (4 vs. 10), and tachycardia (6 vs. 11).

Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions In bipolar mania therapy (up to 3weeks) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents (incidence of 5 or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (53), dizziness (18), fatigue (11), increased appetite (9), nausea (8), vomiting (8), tachycardia (7), dry mouth (7), and weight increased (6). Table 14 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 3weeks) of bipolar mania in 2 or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses of 400 or 600 mgday) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients. Adverse events that were potentially doserelated with higher frequency in the 600 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included somnolence (50 vs. 57), nausea (6 vs. 10) and tachycardia (6 vs. 9).

Laboratory, ECG and vital sign changes observed in clinical studies Laboratory Changes Neutrophil Counts Adults In placebocontrolled monotherapy clinical trials involving 3368 patients on quetiapine fumarate and 1515 on placebo, the incidence of at least one occurrence of neutrophil count 1.0 x 109L among patients with a normal baseline neutrophil count and at least one available follow up laboratory measurement was 0.3 (102967) in patients treated with quetiapine fumarate, compared to 0.1 (21349) in patients treated with placebo. see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) Transaminase Elevations Adults Asymptomatic, transient and reversible elevations in serum transaminases (primarily ALT) have been reported. In schizophrenia trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of  3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3 to 6week placebocontrolled trials were approximately 6 (29483) for quetiapine compared to 1 (3194) for placebo. In acute bipolar mania trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of  3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3 to 12week placebocontrolled trials were approximately 1 for both quetiapine (3560) and placebo (3294). These hepatic enzyme elevations usually occurred within the first 3 weeks of drug treatment and promptly returned to prestudy levels with ongoing treatment with quetiapine. In bipolar depression trials, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of  3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in two 8week placebocontrolled trials was 1 (5698) for quetiapine and 2 (6347) for placebo. Decreased Hemoglobin Adults In shortterm placebocontrolled trials, decreases in hemoglobin to 13 gdL males, 12 gdL females on at least one occasion occurred in 8.3 (5947155) of quetiapinetreated patients compared to 6.2 (2193536) of patients treated with placebo. In a database of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, decreases in hemoglobin to  13 gdL males,  12 gdL females on at least one occasion occurred in 11 (227720729) of quetiapinetreated patients. Interference with Urine Drug Screens There have been literature reports suggesting false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants in patients who have taken quetiapine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive urine drug screen results for these drugs, and confirmation by alternative analytical technique (e.g. chromatographic methods) should be considered. ECG Changes AdultsBetweengroup comparisons for pooled placebocontrolled trials revealed no statistically significant quetiapineplacebo differences in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc, and PR intervals. However, the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia were compared in four 3 to 6week placebocontrolled clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia revealing a 1 (4399) incidence for quetiapine compared to 0.6 (1156) incidence for placebo. In acute (monotherapy) bipolar mania trials the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia was 0.5 (1192) for quetiapine compared to 0 (0178) incidence for placebo. In acute bipolar mania (adjunct) trials the proportions of patients meeting the same criteria was 0.6 (1166) for quetiapine compared to 0 (0171) incidence for placebo. In bipolar depression trials, no patients had heart rate increases to 120 beats per minute. Quetiapine use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 7 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute among placebo patients. This slight tendency to tachycardia in adults may be related to quetiapines potential for inducing orthostatic changes see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) . Children and Adolescents In the acute (6 week) schizophrenia trial in adolescents, increases in heart rate (110 bpm) occurred in 5.2 (373) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 8.5 (574) of patients receiving quetiapine 800 mg compared to 0 (075) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 3.8 bpm and 11.2 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 800 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 3.3 bpm in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) . In the acute (3 week) bipolar mania trial in children and adolescents, increases in heart rate ( 110 bpm) occurred in 1.1 (189) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 4.7 (485) of patients receiving quetiapine 600 mg compared to 0 (098) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 12.8 bpm and 13.4 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 1.7 bpm in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) . In an acute (8week) quetiapine extended release trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, increases in heart rate ( 110 bpm 10 to 12 years and 13 to 17 years) occurred in 0 of patients receiving quetiapine extended release and 1.2 of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 3.4 bpm for quetiapine extended release, compared to 0.3 bpm in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) . 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval of quetiapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction which were temporally related to quetiapine therapy include anaphylactic reaction, cardiomyopathy, hyponatremia, myocarditis, nocturnal enuresis, pancreatitis, retrograde amnesia, rhabdomyolysis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), StevensJohnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of quetiapine in schizophrenia and its mood stabilizing properties in bipolar depression and mania are mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of quetiapine. Quetiapines antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Quetiapines antagonism of adrenergic 1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Quetiapine is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2 (IC50s717  148nM, respectively), dopamine D1 and D2 (IC50s1268  329nM, respectively), histamine H1 (IC5030nM), and adrenergic 1 and 2receptors (IC50s94  271nM, respectively). Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors (IC50s  5000 nM). Effect on QT Interval In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine see Overdosage (10.1) , in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Quetiapine fumarate activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multipledose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are doseproportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal halflife of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steadystate concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Children and Adolescents At steadystate the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age), were similar to adults. However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and Cmax of the parent compound were 41 and 39 lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and Cmax were 45 and 31 higher, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Absorption Quetiapine fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100 bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25 and 15, respectively. Distribution Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 104 Lkg. It is 83 bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. In vitro, quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine. Metabolism and Elimination Following a single oral dose of 14Cquetiapine, less than 1 of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73 and 20 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite Ndesalkyl quetiapine. Age Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40 in elderly patients ( 65 years, n9) compared to young patients (n12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary see Dosage and Administration (2.3). Gender There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Race There is no race effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Smoking Smoking has no effect on the oral clearance of quetiapine. Renal Insufficiency Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr10 to 30 mLmin1.73 m2, n8) had a 25 lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (Clcr  80 mLmin1.73 m2, n8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with renal insufficiency were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose. Dosage adjustment is therefore not needed in these patients.see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) . Hepatic Insufficiency Hepatically impaired patients (n8) had a 30 lower mean oral clearance of quetiapine than normal subjects. In two of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and Cmax were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects. Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed see Dosage and Administration(2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) . DrugDrug Interaction Studies The in vivo assessments of effect of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are summarized in Table 17 see Dosage and Administration (2.5 and 2.6) and Drug Interactions (7.1) .

<tr><td><i>abuse</i>:</td><td>9.2 Abuse Quetiapine has not been systematically studied, in animals or humans, for its potential for abuse, tolerance or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNSactive drug will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of quetiapine, e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Schizophrenia Shortterm Trials  Adults The efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in 3 shortterm (6week) controlled trials of inpatients with schizophrenia who met DSM IIIR criteria for schizophrenia. Although a single fixed dose haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in one of the three trials, this single haloperidol dose group was inadequate to provide a reliable and valid comparison of quetiapine and haloperidol. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multiitem inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. The results of the trials follow 1. In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n361) (study 1) involving 5 fixed doses of quetiapine (75 mgday, 150 mgday, 300 mgday, 600 mgday and 750 mgday given in divided doses three times per day), the 4 highest doses of quetiapine were generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster and the CGI severity score, with the maximal effect seen at 300 mgday, and the effects of doses of 150 mgday to 750 mgday were generally indistinguishable. 2. In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n286) (study 2) involving titration of quetiapine in high (up to 750 mgday given in divided doses three times per day) and low (up to 250 mgday given in divided doses three times per day) doses, only the high dose quetiapine group (mean dose, 500 mgday) was superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. 3. In a 6week dose and dose regimen comparison trial (n618) (study 3) involving two fixed doses of quetiapine (450 mgday given in divided doses both twice daily and three times daily and 50 mgday given in divided doses twice daily), only the 450 mgday (225 mg given twice daily) dose group was superior to the 50 mgday (25 mg given twice daily) quetiapine dose group on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. The primary efficacy results of these three studies in the treatment of schizophrenia in adults is presented in Table 19. Examination of population subsets (race, gender, and age) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of race or gender, with an apparently greater effect in patients under the age of 40 years compared to those older than 40. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Adolescents (ages 13 to 17) The efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) was demonstrated in a 6week, doubleblind, placebocontrolled trial (study 4). Patients who met DSMIV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were randomized into one of three treatment groups quetiapine 400 mgday (n  73), quetiapine 800 mgday (n  74), or placebo (n  75). Study medication was initiated at 50 mgday and on day 2 increased to 100 mgper day (divided and given two or three times per day). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to the target dose of 400 mgday or 800 mgday using increments of 100 mgday, divided and given two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Quetiapine at 400 mgday and 800 mgday was superior to placebo in the reduction of PANSS total score. The primary efficacy results of this study in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents is presented in Table 19.

These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and excluded patients with rapid cycling and mixed episodes. Of these trials, 2 were monotherapy (12 weeks) and 1 was adjunct therapy (3 weeks) to either lithium or divalproex. Key outcomes in these trials were change from baseline in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score at 3 and 12 weeks for monotherapy and at 3 weeks for adjunct therapy. Adjunct therapy is defined as the simultaneous initiation or subsequent administration of quetiapine with lithium or divalproex. The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was YMRS, an 11item clinicianrated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptiveaggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, languagethought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The results of the trials follow Monotherapy The efficacy of quetiapine in the acute treatment of bipolar mania was established in 2 placebocontrolled trials. In two 12week trials (n300, n299) comparing quetiapine to placebo, quetiapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of the YMRS total score at weeks 3 and 12. The majority of patients in these trials taking quetiapine were dosed in a range between 400 mgday and 800 mg per day (studies 1 and 2 in Table 20). Adjunct Therapy In this 3week placebocontrolled trial, 170 patients with bipolar mania (YMRS  20) were randomized to receive quetiapine or placebo as adjunct treatment to lithium or divalproex. Patients may or may not have received an adequate treatment course of lithium or divalproex prior to randomization. Quetiapine was superior to placebo when added to lithium or divalproex alone in the reduction of YMRS total score (study 3 in Table 20). The majority of patients in this trial taking quetiapine were dosed in a range between 400 mgday and 800 mg per day. In a similarly designed trial (n200), quetiapine was associated with an improvement in YMRS scores but did not demonstrate superiority to placebo, possibly due to a higher placebo effect. The primary efficacy results of these studies in the treatment of mania in adults is presented in Table 20. Children and Adolescents (ages 10 to 17) The efficacy of quetiapine in the acute treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) was demonstrated in a 3week, doubleblind, placebocontrolled, multicenter trial (study 4 in Table 20). Patients who met DSMIV diagnostic criteria for a manic episode were randomized into one of three treatment groups quetiapine 400 mgday (n  95), quetiapine 600 mgday (n  98), or placebo (n  91). Study medication was initiated at 50 mgday and on day 2 increased to 100 mgday (divided doses given two or three times daily). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to a target dose of 400 mgday or 600 mgday using increments of 100 mgday, given in divided doses two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total YMRS score. Quetiapine 400 mgday and 600mgday were superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score (Table 20).

Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Episodes Adults The efficacy of quetiapine for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder was established in 2 identically designed 8week, randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled studies (N1045) (studies 5 and 6 in Table 21).. These studies included patients with either bipolar I or II disorder and those with or without a rapid cycling course. Patients randomized to quetiapine were administered fixed doses of either 300 mg or 600 mg once daily. The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in these studies was the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10item clinicianrated scale with scores ranging from 0 to 60. The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. In both studies, quetiapine was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score. Improvement in symptoms, as measured by change in MADRS score relative to placebo, was seen in both studies at Day 8 (week 1) and onwards. In these studies, no additional benefit was seen with the 600 mg dose. For the 300 mg dose group, statistically significant improvements over placebo were seen in overall quality of life and satisfaction related to various areas of functioning, as measured using the QLESQ(SF). The primary efficacy results of these studies in the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adults is presented in Table 21.

Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Divalproex The efficacy of quetiapine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 placebocontrolled trials in patients (n1326) who met DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder (studies 7 and 8 in Figures 1 and 2).. The trials included patients whose most recent episode was manic, depressed, or mixed, with or without psychotic features. In the openlabel phase, patients were required to be stable on quetiapine plus lithium or divalproex for at least 12 weeks in order to be randomized. On average, patients were stabilized for 15 weeks. In the randomization phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or divalproex and were randomized to receive either quetiapine (administered twice daily totaling 400 mgday to 800 mgday) or placebo. Approximately 50 of the patients had discontinued from the quetiapine group by day 280 and 50 of the placebo group had discontinued by day 117 of doubleblind treatment. The primary endpoint in these studies was time to recurrence of a mood event (manic, mixed or depressed episode). A mood event was defined as medication initiation or hospitalization for a mood episode YMRS score 20 or MADRS score  20 at 2 consecutive assessments or study discontinuation due to a mood event. (Figure 1 and Figure 2) In both studies, quetiapine was superior to placebo in increasing the time to recurrence of any mood event. The treatment effect was present for increasing time to recurrence of both manic and depressed episodes. The effect of quetiapine was independent of any specific subgroup (assigned mood stabilizer, sex, age, race, most recent bipolar episode, or rapid cycling course).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Limited human data. Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. Quetiapine should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk (8.1) Nursing Mothers Discontinue drug or nursing, taking into consideration importance of drug to mothers health (8.3) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Risk Summary There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of quetiapine use in pregnant women. In limited published literature, there were no major malformations associated with quetiapine exposure during pregnancy. In animal studies, embryofetal toxicity occurred. Quetiapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Human Data There are limited published data on the use of quetiapine for treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. In a prospective observational study, 21 women exposed to quetiapine and other psychoactive medications during pregnancy delivered infants with no major malformations. Among 42 other infants born to pregnant women who used quetiapine during pregnancy, there were no major malformations reported (one study of 36 women, 6 case reports). Due to the limited number of exposed pregnancies, these postmarketing data do not reliably estimate the frequency or absence of adverse outcomes. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including quetiapine), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Animal Data When pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to quetiapine during organogenesis, there was no teratogenic effect at doses up to 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for schizophrenia of 800 mgday based on mgm2 body surface area. However, there was evidence of embryofetal toxicity, which included delays in skeletal ossification occurring at approximately 1 and 2 times the MRHD of 800 mgday in both rats and rabbits, and an increased incidence of carpaltarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the MRHD. In addition, fetal weights were decreased in both species. Maternal toxicity (observed as decreased body weights andor death) occurred at 2 times the MRHD in rats and approximately 1 to 2 times the MRHD (all doses tested) in rabbits. In a peripostnatal reproductive study in rats, no drugrelated effects were observed when pregnant dams were treated with quetiapine at doses 0.01, 0.12, and 0.24 times the MRHD of 800 mgday based on mgm2 body surface area. However, in a preliminary peripostnatal study, there were increases in fetal and pup death, and decreases in mean litter weight at 3 times the MRHD. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of quetiapine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Quetiapine was excreted into human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from quetiapine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mothers health. In published case reports, the level of quetiapine in breast milk ranged from undetectable to 170 gL. The estimated infant dose ranged from 0.09 to 0.43 of the weightadjusted maternal dose. Based on a limited number (N8) of motherinfant pairs, calculated infant daily doses range from less than 0.01 mgkg (at a maternal daily dose up to 100 mg quetiapine) to 0.1 mgkg (at a maternal daily dose of 400 mg). 8.4 Pediatric Use In general, the adverse reactions observed in children and adolescents during the clinical trials were similar to those in the adult population with few exceptions. Increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in children and adolescents and did not occur in adults. Orthostatic hypotension occurred more frequently in adults (4 to 7) compared to children and adolescents ( 1) see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Adverse Reactions (6.1). Schizophrenia The efficacy and safety of quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years were demonstrated in one 6week, doubleblind, placebocontrolled trial see Indications and Usage (1.1), Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1). Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age with schizophrenia have not been established. Maintenance The safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder has not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia has not been established in any patient population, including pediatric patients. Bipolar Mania The efficacy and safety of quetiapine in the treatment of mania in children and adolescents ages 10 to 17 years with Bipolar I disorder was demonstrated in a 3week, doubleblind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial. see Indications and Usage (1.2), Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14.2). Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age with bipolar mania have not been established Bipolar Depression Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with bipolar depression have not been established. A clinical trial with quetiapine extended release was conducted in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, efficacy was not established. Some differences in the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine were noted between childrenadolescents (10 to 17 years of age) and adults. When adjusted for weight, the AUC and Cmax of quetiapine were 41 and 39 lower, respectively, in children and adolescents compared to adults. The pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite, norquetiapine, were similar between childrenadolescents and adults after adjusting for weight see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the approximately 3700 patients in clinical studies with quetiapine, 7 (232) were 65 years of age or over. In general, there was no indication of any different tolerability of quetiapine in the elderly compared to younger adults. Nevertheless, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance, increase the pharmacodynamic response to quetiapine, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period in the elderly. The mean plasma clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 30 to 50 in elderly patients when compared to younger patients see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3) . 8.6 Renal Impairment Clinical experience with quetiapine in patients with renal impairment is limited see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in patients with hepatic impairment. In this population, a low starting dose of 25 mgday is recommended and the dose may be increased in increments of 25 mgday to 50 mgday see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in C57BL mice and Wistar rats. Quetiapine was administered in the diet to mice at doses of 20, 75, 250, and 750 mgkg and to rats by gavage at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mgkg for two years. These doses are equivalent to 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 times the maximum human dose (MRHD) of 800 mgday based on mgm2 body surface area (mice) or 0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD based on mgm2 body surface area (rats). There were statistically significant increases in thyroid gland follicular adenomas in male mice at doses 1.5 and 4.5 times the MRHD on mgm2 body surface area and in male rats at a dose of 3 times the MRHD on mgm2 body surface area. Mammary gland adenocarcinomas were statistically significantly increased in female rats at all doses tested (0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD on mgm2 body surface area). Thyroid follicular cell adenomas may have resulted from chronic stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) resulting from enhanced metabolism and clearance of thyroxine by rodent liver. Changes in TSH, thyroxine, and thyroxine clearance consistent with this mechanism were observed in subchronic toxicity studies in rat and mouse and in a 1year toxicity study in rat however, the results of these studies were not definitive. The relevance of the increases in thyroid follicular cell adenomas to human risk, through whatever mechanism, is unknown. Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum measurements in a 1year toxicity study showed that quetiapine increased median serum prolactin levels a maximum of 32 and 13fold in male and female rats, respectively. Increases in mammary neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and are considered to be prolactinmediated. The relevance of this increased incidence of prolactinmediated mammary gland tumors in rats to human risk is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.14). Mutagenesis The mutagenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the in vitro Ames bacterial gene mutation assay and in the in vitro mammalian gene mutation assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The clastogenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats up to 500 mgkg which is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on mgm2 body surface area. Based on weight of evidence quetiapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in these tests. Impairment of Fertility Quetiapine decreased mating and fertility in male SpragueDawley rats at oral doses of 50 and 150 mgkg or approximately 1 and 3 times the maximum human dose (MRHD) of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. Drugrelated effects included increases in interval to mate and in the number of matings required for successful impregnation. These effects continued to be observed at 3 times the MRHD even after a twoweek period without treatment. The noeffect dose for impaired mating and fertility in male rats was 25 mgkg, or 0.3 times the MRHD dose on mgm2 body surface area. Quetiapine adversely affected mating and fertility in female SpragueDawley rats at an oral dose approximately 1 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. Drugrelated effects included decreases in matings and in matings resulting in pregnancy, and an increase in the interval to mate. An increase in irregular estrus cycles was observed at doses of 10 and 50 mgkg, or approximately 0.1 and 1 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm 2 body surface area. The noeffect dose in female rats was 1 mgkg, or 0.01 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. 13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology Quetiapine caused a doserelated increase in pigment deposition in thyroid gland in rat toxicity studies which were 4 weeks in duration or longer and in a mouse 2year carcinogenicity study. Doses were 10 to 250 mgkg in rats and 75 to 750 mgkg in mice these doses are 0.1 to 3, and 0.1 to 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area, respectively. Pigment deposition was shown to be irreversible in rats. The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be colocalized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells. The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown. In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1 month, focal triangular cataracts occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mgkg, or 4 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a doserelated reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeatdose dog and monkey studies however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs. The appearance of delta 8 cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25 reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs. Drugrelated cataracts have not been seen in any other species however, in a 1year study in monkeys, a striated appearance of the anterior lens surface was detected in 27 females at a dose of 225 mgkg or 5.5 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm 2 body surface area.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use Of the approximately 3700 patients in clinical studies with quetiapine, 7 (232) were 65 years of age or over. In general, there was no indication of any different tolerability of quetiapine in the elderly compared to younger adults. Nevertheless, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance, increase the pharmacodynamic response to quetiapine, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period in the elderly. The mean plasma clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 30 to 50 in elderly patients when compared to younger patients see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3) ., 8.6 Renal Impairment Clinical experience with quetiapine in patients with renal impairment is limited see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)., 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in patients with hepatic impairment. In this population, a low starting dose of 25 mgday is recommended and the dose may be increased in increments of 25 mgday to 50 mgday see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>"10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported reactions. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drugs known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension. Patients with preexisting severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose see Warnings and Precautions (5.11). One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In postmarketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose. There were also very rare reports of overdose of quetiapine alone resulting in death or coma. 10.2 Management of Overdosage In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QTprolonging effects when administered in patients with acute overdosage of quetiapine. Similarly it is reasonable to expect that the alphaadrenergicblocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of quetiapine, resulting in problematic hypotension. There is no specific antidote to quetiapine. Therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be instituted. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids andor sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of quetiapineinduced alpha blockade). In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics Quetiapine is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2 (IC50s717  148nM, respectively), dopamine D1 and D2 (IC50s1268  329nM, respectively), histamine H1 (IC5030nM), and adrenergic 1 and 2receptors (IC50s94  271nM, respectively). Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors (IC50s  5000 nM). Effect on QT Interval In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine see Overdosage (10.1) , in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g. stroke, transient ischemic attack) has been seen in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs (5.3) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring. (5.4) Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with metabolic changes. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain (5.5) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Monitor patients for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended, including fasting blood lipid testing at the beginning of, and periodically, during treatment Weight Gain Gain in body weight has been observed clinical monitoring of weight is recommended Tardive Dyskinesia Discontinue if clinically appropriate (5.6) Hypotension Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease (5.7) Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents Monitor blood pressure at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment in children and adolescents 5.8) Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Monitor complete blood count frequently during the first few months of treatment in patients with a preexisting low white cell count or a history of leukopenianeutropenia and discontinue quetiapine fumarate tablets at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors (5.9) Cataracts Lens changes have been observed in patients during longterm quetiapine treatment. Lens examination is recommended when starting treatment and at 6month intervals during chronic treatment (5.10) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning . 5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression andor the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a longstanding concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of shortterm placebocontrolled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Shortterm studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 shortterm trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 shortterm trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drugplacebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2. Table 2 DrugPlacebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Age Range DrugPlacebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo 18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case 65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longerterm use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebocontrolled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression andor the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for quetiapine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixedmanic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including quetiapine, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. 5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis In placebocontrolled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebotreated subjects. Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see also Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported. 5.5 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemiadiabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose, and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these metabolic profiles should be managed as clinically appropriate. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatmentemergent hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. Adults Table 3 Fasting Glucose  Proportion of Patients Shifting to  126 mgdL in ShortTerm ( 12 weeks) Placebo Controlled StudiesIncludes quetiapine and quetiapine extended release data Laboratory Analyte Category Change (At Least Once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N Patients n () Fasting Glucose Normal to High ( 100 mgdL to  126 mgdL) Quetiapine 2907 71 (2.4) Placebo 1346 19 (1.4) Borderline to High (100 mgdL and 126 mgdL to  126 mgdL) Quetiapine 572 67 (11.7) Placebo 279 33 (11.8) In a 24week trial (activecontrolled, 115 patients treated with quetiapine) designed to evaluate glycemic status with oral glucose tolerance testing of all patients, at week 24 the incidence of a treatmentemergent postglucose challenge glucose level  200 mgdL was 1.7 and the incidence of a fasting treatmentemergent blood glucose level  126 mgdL was 2.6. The mean change in fasting glucose from baseline was 3.2 mgdL and mean change in 2 hour glucose from baseline was 1.8 mgdL for quetiapine. In 2 longterm placebocontrolled randomized withdrawal clinical trials for bipolar I disorder maintenance, mean exposure of 213 days for quetiapine (646 patients) and 152 days for placebo (680 patients), the mean change in glucose from baseline was 5.0 mgdL for quetiapine and 0.05 mgdL for placebo. The exposureadjusted rate of any increased blood glucose level ( 126 mgdL) for patients more than 8 hours since a meal (however, some patients may not have been precluded from calorie intake from fluids during fasting period) was 18.0 per 100 patient years for quetiapine (10.7 of patients n556) and 9.5 for placebo per 100 patient years (4.6 of patients n581). Children and Adolescents In a placebocontrolled quetiapine monotherapy study of adolescent patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia (6 weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose levels for quetiapine (n138) compared to placebo (n67) was  0.75 mgdL versus 1.70 mgdL. In a placebocontrolled quetiapine monotherapy study of children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania (3 weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose level for quetiapine (n170) compared to placebo (n81) was 3.62 mgdL versus 1.17 mgdL. No patient in either study with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (100 mgdL) or a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (100 mgdL and 126 mgdL) had a treatmentemergent blood glucose level of 126 mgdL. In a placebocontrolled quetiapine extended release monotherapy study (8 weeks duration) of children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the mean change in fasting glucose levels for quetiapine extended release (n  60) compared to placebo (n  62) was 1.8 mgdL versus 1.6 mgdL. In this study, there were no patients in the quetiapine extended release or placebotreated groups with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (100 mgdL) that had an increase in blood glucose level 126 mgdL. There was one patient in the quetiapine extended release group with a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (100 mgdL) and ( 126 mgdL) who had an increase in blood glucose level of  126 mgdL compared to zero patients in the placebo group.

Weight Gain Increases in weight have been observed in clinical trials. Patients receiving quetiapine should receive regular monitoring of weight. Adults In clinical trials with quetiapine the following increases in weight have been reported.

Table 7 Proportion of Patients with Weight Gain 7 of Body Weight (Children and Adolescents) Vital Sign Indication Treatment Arm N Patients n () Weight Gain 7 of Body Weight Schizophrenia 6 weeks duration Quetiapine 111 23 (21) Placebo 44 3 (7) Bipolar Mania 3 weeks duration Quetiapine 157 18 (12) Placebo 68 0 (0) The mean change in body weight in the schizophrenia trial was 2.0 kg in the quetiapine group and 0.4 kg in the placebo group and in the bipolar mania trial it was 1.7 kg in the quetiapine group and 0.4 kg in the placebo group. In an openlabel study that enrolled patients from the above two pediatric trials, 63 of patients (241380) completed 26 weeks of therapy with quetiapine. After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean increase in body weight was 4.4 kg. Fortyfive percent of the patients gained  7 of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. In order to adjust for normal growth over 26 weeks an increase of at least 0.5 standard deviation from baseline in BMI was used as a measure of a clinically significant change 18.3 of patients on quetiapine met this criterion after 26 weeks of treatment. In a clinical trial for quetiapine extended release in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the percentage of patients with weight gain 7 of body weight at any time was 15 (1492) for quetiapine extended release vs. 10 (10100) for placebo. The mean change in body weight was 1.4 kg in the quetiapine extended release group vs. 0.6 kg in the placebo group. When treating pediatric patients with quetiapine for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected for normal growth. 5.6 Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, quetiapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on quetiapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with quetiapine despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.7 Hypotension Quetiapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its 1adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 1 (283265) of the patients treated with quetiapine, compared with 0.2 (2954) on placebo and about 0.4 (2527) on active control drugs. Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope may lead to falls. Quetiapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia and treatment with antihypertensive medications) The risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 25 mg twice daily see Dosage and Administration (2.2). If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration schedule is appropriate. 5.8 Increases in Blood Pressure (Children and Adolescents) In placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (6week duration) or bipolar mania (3week duration), the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (20 mmHg) was 15.2 (51335) for quetiapine and 5.5 (9163) for placebo the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (10 mmHg) was 40.6 (136335) for quetiapine and 24.5 (40163) for placebo. In the 26week openlabel clinical trial, one child with a reported history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis. Blood pressure in children and adolescents should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment. In a placebocontrolled quetiapine extended release clinical trial (8 weeks duration) in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (20 mmHg) was 6.5 (692) for quetiapine extended release and 6.0 (6100) for placebo the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (10 mmHg) was 46.7 (4392) for quetiapine extended release and 36.0 (36100) for placebo. 5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to atypical antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue quetiapine at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm3) should discontinue quetiapine and have their WBC followed until recovery. 5.10 Cataracts The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2). Lens changes have also been observed in adults, children and adolescents during longterm quetiapine treatment, but a causal relationship to quetiapine use has not been established. Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as slit lamp exam or other appropriately sensitive methods, is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6month intervals during chronic treatment. 5.11 QT Prolongation In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine see Overdosage (10.1) in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval see Drug Interactions (7.1). The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone). Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes andor sudden death including (1) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g. cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure and heart hypertrophy). 5.12 Seizures During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.5 (203490) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 0.2 (2954) on placebo and 0.7 (4527) on active control drugs. As with other antipsychotics, quetiapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimers dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.13 Hypothyroidism Adults Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated doserelated decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine (T4) of approximately 20 at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T4, irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear. If there is an effect on the hypothalamicpituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patients thyroid status. Therefore, both TSH and free T4, in addition to clinical assessment, should be measured at baseline and at followup. In the mania adjunct studies, where quetiapine was added to lithium or divalproex, 12 (24196) of quetiapine treated patients compared to 7 (15203) of placebotreated patients had elevated TSH levels. Of the quetiapine treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 3 had simultaneous low free T4 levels (free T4 0.8 LLN). About 0.7 (263489) of quetiapine patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment. In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of significant shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH were decrease in free T4 (free T4 0.8 LLN) 2.0 (35717513) decrease in total T4, 4.0 (751861) decrease in free T3, 0.4 (5313766) decrease in total T3, 2.0 (261312), and increase in TSH, 4.9 (95619412). In eight patients, where TBG was measured, levels of TBG were unchanged. Table 8 shows the incidence of these shifts in shortterm placebocontrolled clinical trials. Table 8 Incidence of shifts in thyroid hormone levels and TSH in short term placebocontrolled clinical trialsBased on shifts from normal baseline to potentially clinically important value at anytime postbaseline. Shifts in total T4, free T4, total T3 and free T3 are defined as 0.8 x LLN (pmolL) and shift in TSH is  5 mlUL at any time., Includes quetiapine and quetiapine extended release data. Total T4 Free T4 Total T3 Free T3 TSH Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo 3.4  (371097) 0.6 (4651) 0.7 (527218) 0.1 (43668) 0.5 (2369) 0.0 (0113) 0.2 (115673) 0.0 (12679) 3.2 (2407587) 2.7 (1053912) In shortterm placebocontrolled monotherapy trials, the incidence of reciprocal, shifts in T3 and TSH was 0.0  for both quetiapine (14800) and placebo (02190) and for T4 and TSH the shifts were 0.1 (76154) for quetiapine versus 0.0 (13007) for placebo. Children and Adolescents In acute placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescent patients with schizophrenia (6week duration) or bipolar mania (3week duration), the incidence of shifts for thyroid function values at any time for quetiapine treated patients and placebotreated patients for elevated TSH was 2.9 (8280) vs. 0.7 (1138), respectively and for decreased total thyroxine was 2.8 (8289) vs. 0 (0145, respectively). Of the quetiapine treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 1 had simultaneous low free T4 level at end of treatment. 5.14 Hyperprolactinemia Adults During clinical trials with quetiapine, the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a clinically significant value occurred in 3.6 (1584416) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 2.6 (511968) on placebo. Children and Adolescents In acute placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescent patients with bipolar mania (3week duration) or schizophrenia (6week duration), the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a value (20 gL males  26 gL females at any time) was 13.4 (18134) for quetiapine compared to 4 (375) for placebo in males and 8.7 (9104) for quetiapine compared to 0 (039) for placebo in females. Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, quetiapine elevates prolactin levels in some patients and the elevation may persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactinelevating compounds. Longstanding hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, mammary gland and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive seeNonclinical Toxicology (13.1). 5.15 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse event reported in patients treated with quetiapine especially during the 3 to 5 day period of initial dosetitration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 18 (89510) of patients on quetiapine compared to 11 (22206) of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine as monotherapy, somnolence was reported in 16 (34209) of patients on quetiapine compared to 4 of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine as adjunct therapy, somnolence was reported in 34 (66196) of patients on quetiapine compared to 9 (19203) of placebo patients. In bipolar depression trials, somnolence was reported in 57 (398698) of patients on quetiapine compared to 15 (51347) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls. 5.16 Body Temperature Regulation Although not reported with quetiapine, disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing quetiapine for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration. 5.17 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimers dementia. Quetiapine and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. 5.18 Discontinuation Syndrome Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. In shortterm placebocontrolled, monotherapy clinical trials with quetiapine extended release that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1 (2411993) for quetiapine extended release and 6.7 (711065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse events (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness and irritability) did not exceed 5.3 in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1 week postdiscontinuation. Gradual withdrawal is advised."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>animal_pharmacology_and_or_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology Quetiapine caused a doserelated increase in pigment deposition in thyroid gland in rat toxicity studies which were 4 weeks in duration or longer and in a mouse 2year carcinogenicity study. Doses were 10 to 250 mgkg in rats and 75 to 750 mgkg in mice these doses are 0.1 to 3, and 0.1 to 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area, respectively. Pigment deposition was shown to be irreversible in rats. The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be colocalized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells. The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown. In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1 month, focal triangular cataracts occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mgkg, or 4 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm2 body surface area. This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a doserelated reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeatdose dog and monkey studies however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs. The appearance of delta 8 cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25 reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs. Drugrelated cataracts have not been seen in any other species however, in a 1year study in monkeys, a striated appearance of the anterior lens surface was detected in 27 females at a dose of 225 mgkg or 5.5 times the MRHD of 800 mgday on mgm 2 body surface area.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES In relatively shortterm clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with "anorectic" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drugtreated patients over placebotreated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an "anorectic" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physicianinvestigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and nondrug factors on weight loss. The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks duration thus, the total impact of druginduced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. (4, 8.3) Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness not established. (8.4) Geriatric use Due to substantial renal excretion, use with caution. (8.5) Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category X Phentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d and dlamphetamine) see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring longterm treatment, the use of this product, approved for shortterm therapy, is not recommended. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Renal Impairment Phentermine was not studied in patients with renal impairment. Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment.

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 10.1 Acute Overdosage Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Overdosage of pharmacologically similar compounds has resulted in fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma. Management of acute phentermine hydrochloride intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine (Regitine, CIBA) has been suggested on pharmacologic grounds for possible acute, severe hypertension, if this complicates overdosage. 10.2 Chronic Intoxication Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). (5.1) Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Phentermine should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. (5.2) Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. (5.3) Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, phentermine should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. (5.4) Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. (5.5) Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. (5.6) Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. (5.7) Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). (5.8) A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. (5.9) 5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss Phentermine hydrochloride tablets are indicated only as shortterm (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, overthecounter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended. 5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH)  a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs  has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. 5.3 Valvular Heart Disease Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic andor tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. 5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect rather, the drug should be discontinued. 5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks Phentermine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. 5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d and dlamphetamine) and other related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) and Overdosage (10) . The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. 5.7 Usage With Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction. 5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension Use caution in prescribing phentermine for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). 5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required.</td></tr>

Specific Populations Renal Impairment Phentermine was not studied in patients with renal impairment. The literature reported cumulative urinary excretion of phentermine under uncontrolled urinary pH conditions is 62 to 85. Exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. Drug Interactions In a singledose study comparing the exposures after oral administration of a combination capsule of 15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate to the exposures after oral administration of a 15 mg phentermine capsule or a 92 mg topiramate capsule, there is no significant topiramate exposure change in the presence of phentermine. However in the presence of topiramate, phentermine Cmax and AUC increase 13 and 42, respectively.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in C57BL mice and Wistar rats. Quetiapine was administered in the diet to mice at doses of 20, 75, 250, and 750 mgkg and to rats by gavage at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mgkg for two years. These doses are equivalent to 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 times the maximum human dose (800 mgday) on a mgm2 basis (mice) or 0.3, 0.9, and 3.0 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis (rats). There were statistically significant increases in thyroid gland follicular adenomas in male mice at doses of 250 and 750 mgkg or 1.5 and 4.5 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis and in male rats at a dose of 250 mgkg or 3.0 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. Mammary gland adenocarcinomas were statistically significantly increased in female rats at all doses tested (25, 75, and 250 mgkg or 0.3, 0.9, and 3.0 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis). Thyroid follicular cell adenomas may have resulted from chronic stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) resulting from enhanced metabolism and clearance of thyroxine by rodent liver. Changes in TSH, thyroxine, and thyroxine clearance consistent with this mechanism were observed in subchronic toxicity studies in rat and mouse and in a 1 year toxicity study in rat however, the results of these studies were not definitive. The relevance of the increases in thyroid follicular cell adenomas to human risk, through whatever mechanism, is unknown. Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum measurements in a 1 year toxicity study showed that quetiapine increased median serum prolactin levels a maximum of 32 and 13 fold in male and female rats, respectively. Increases in mammary neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and are considered to be prolactinmediated. The relevance of this increased incidence of prolactinmediated mammary gland tumors in rats to human risk is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.14). Mutagenesis The mutagenic potential of quetiapine was tested in six in vitro bacterial gene mutation assays and in an in vitro mammalian gene mutation assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. However, sufficiently high concentrations of quetiapine may not have been used for all tester strains. Quetiapine did produce a reproducible increase in mutations in one Salmonella typhimurium tester strain in the presence of metabolic activation. No evidence of clastogenic potential was obtained in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes or in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats. Impairment of Fertility Quetiapine decreased mating and fertility in male SpragueDawley rats at oral doses of 50 and 150 mgkg or 0.6 and 1.8 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. Drugrelated effects included increases in interval to mate and in the number of matings required for successful impregnation. These effects continued to be observed at 150 mgkg even after a twoweek period without treatment. The noeffect dose for impaired mating and fertility in male rats was 25 mgkg, or 0.3 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. Quetiapine adversely affected mating and fertility in female SpragueDawley rats at an oral dose of 50 mgkg, or 0.6 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. Drugrelated effects included decreases in matings and in matings resulting in pregnancy, and an increase in the interval to mate. An increase in irregular estrus cycles was observed at doses of 10 and 50 mgkg, or 0.1 and 0.6 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. The noeffect dose in female rats was 1 mgkg, or 0.01 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of quetiapine use in pregnant women. In limited published literature, there were no major malformations associated with quetiapine exposure during pregnancy. In animal studies, embryofetal toxicity occurred. Quetiapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are limited published data on the use of quetiapine for treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. In a prospective observational study, 21 women exposed to quetiapine and other psychoactive medications during pregnancy delivered infants with no major malformations. Among 42 other infants born to pregnant women who used quetiapine during pregnancy, there were no major malformations reported (one study of 36 women, 6 case reports). Due to the limited number of exposed pregnancies, these postmarketing data do not reliably estimate the frequency or absence of adverse outcomes. When pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to quetiapine during organogenesis, there was no increase in the incidence of major malformations in fetuses at doses up to 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose for schizophrenia (MRHD, 800 mgday on a mgm2 basis) however, there was evidence of embryofetal toxicity. In rats, delays in skeletal ossification occurred at 0.6 and 2.4 times the MRHD and in rabbits at 1.2 and 2.4 times the MRHD. At 2.4 times the MRHD, there was an increased incidence of carpaltarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses and decreased fetal weights in both species. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weights andor death) occurred at 2.4 times the MRHD in rats and at 0.6 to 2.4 times the MRHD (all doses) in rabbits. In a peripostnatal reproductive study in rats, no drugrelated effects were observed when pregnant dams were treated with quetiapine at doses 0.01, 0.12, and 0.24 times the MRHD. However, in a preliminary peripostnatal study, there were increases in fetal and pup death, and decreases in mean litter weight at 3.0 times the MRHD. NonTeratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including quetiapine), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Quetiapine fumarate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Quetiapine fumarate activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multipledose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are doseproportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal halflife of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steadystate concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Children and Adolescents Pharmacokinetic information in patients (10 to 17 years of age) is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs quetiapine fumarate drug product labeling. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs marketing exclusivity rights this drug product is not labeled for such use in those patients. Absorption Quetiapine fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100 bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25 and 15, respectively. Distribution Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 104 Lkg. It is 83 bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. In vitro, quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine. Metabolism and Elimination Following a single oral dose of 14Cquetiapine, less than 1 of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73 and 20 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite Ndesalkyl quetiapine. Age Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40 in elderly patients ( 65 years, n9) compared to young patients (n12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary see Dosage and Administration (2). Gender There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Race There is no race effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Smoking Smoking has no effect on the oral clearance of quetiapine. Renal Insufficiency Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr1030 mLmin1.73 m2, n8) had a 25 lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (Clcr  80 mLmin1.73 m2, n8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with renal insufficiency were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose. Dosage adjustment is therefore not needed in these patients. Hepatic Insufficiency Hepatically impaired patients (n8) had a 30 lower mean oral clearance of quetiapine than normal subjects. In two of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and Cmax were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects. Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed see Dosage and Administration (2). DrugDrug Interactions In vitro enzyme inhibition data suggest that quetiapine and 9 of its metabolites would have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by cytochromes P450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Quetiapine oral clearance is increased by the prototype cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer, phenytoin, and decreased by the prototype cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole. Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is coadministered with phenytoin or ketoconazole see Drug Interactions (7.1). Quetiapine oral clearance is not inhibited by the nonspecific enzyme inhibitor, cimetidine. Quetiapine at doses of 750 mgday did not affect the single dose pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, lithium or lorazepam see Drug Interactions (7.2).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risks of using quetiapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of quetiapine, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be avoided while taking quetiapine fumarate tablets. Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, quetiapine may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Quetiapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with drugs known to increase QT interval, and caution should be exercised when quetiapine is used in combination with drugs known to cause electrolyte imbalance see Warnings and Precautions (5.12). There have been literature reports suggesting false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants in patients who have taken quetiapine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive urine drug screen results for these drugs, and confirmation by alternative analytical technique (e.g. chromatographic methods) should be considered. P450 3A Inhibitors May decrease the clearance of quetiapine. Lower doses of quetiapine may be required. (7.1) Hepatic Enzyme Inducers May increase the clearance of quetiapine. Higher doses of quetiapine may be required with phenytoin or other inducers. (7.1) Centrally Acting Drugs Caution should be used when quetiapine is used in combination with other CNS acting drugs. (7) Antihypertensive Agents Quetiapine may add to the hypotensive effects of these agents. (7) Levodopa and Dopamine Agents Quetiapine may antagonize the effect of these drugs. (7) Drugs known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval Caution should be used when quetiapine is used concomitantly with these drugs. (7) Interference with Urine Drug Screens False positive urine drug screens using immunoassays for methadone or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in patients taking quetiapine have been reported. (7). 7.1 The Effect of Other Drugs on Quetiapine Phenytoin Coadministration of quetiapine (250 mg three times daily) and phenytoin (100 mg three times daily) increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5fold. Increased doses of quetiapine may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampin, glucocorticoids). Caution should be taken if phenytoin is withdrawn and replaced with a noninducer (e.g., valproate) see Dosage and Administration (2). Divalproex Coadministration of quetiapine (150 mg twice daily) and divalproex (500 mg twice daily) increased the mean maximum plasma concentration of quetiapine at steady state by 17 without affecting the extent of absorption or mean oral clearance. Thioridazine Thioridazine (200 mg twice daily) increased the oral clearance of quetiapine (300 mg twice daily) by 65. Cimetidine Administration of multiple daily doses of cimetidine (400 mg three times daily for 4 days) resulted in a 20 decrease in the mean oral clearance of quetiapine (150 mg three times daily). Dosage adjustment for quetiapine is not required when it is given with cimetidine. P450 3A Inhibitors Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg once daily for 4 days), a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A, reduced oral clearance of quetiapine by 84, resulting in a 335 increase in maximum plasma concentration of quetiapine. Caution (reduced dosage) is indicated when quetiapine is administered with ketoconazole and other inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A (e.g., itraconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin, and protease inhibitors). Fluoxetine, Imipramine, Haloperidol, and Risperidone Coadministration of fluoxetine (60 mg once daily), imipramine (75 mg twice daily), haloperidol (7.5 mg twice daily), or risperidone (3 mg twice daily) with quetiapine (300 mg twice daily) did not alter the steadystate pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. 7.2 Effect of Quetiapine on Other Drugs Lorazepam The mean oral clearance of lorazepam (2 mg, single dose) was reduced by 20 in the presence of quetiapine administered as 250 mg three times daily dosing. Divalproex The mean maximum concentration and extent of absorption of total and free valproic acid at steady state were decreased by 10 to 12 when divalproex (500 mg twice daily) was administered with quetiapine (150 mg twice daily). The mean oral clearance of total valproic acid (administered as divalproex 500 mg twice daily) was increased by 11 in the presence of quetiapine (150 mg twice daily). The changes were not significant. Lithium Concomitant administration of quetiapine (250 mg three times daily) with lithium had no effect on any of the steadystate pharmacokinetic parameters of lithium. Antipyrine Administration of multiple daily doses up to 750 mgday (on a three times daily schedule) of quetiapine to subjects with selected psychotic disorders had no clinically relevant effect on the clearance of antipyrine or urinary recovery of antipyrine metabolites. These results indicate that quetiapine does not significantly induce hepatic enzymes responsible for cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of antipyrine.</td></tr>

The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine fumarate consisting of over 4300 patients. This database includes 698 patients exposed to quetiapine fumarate for the treatment of bipolar depression, 405 patients exposed to quetiapine fumarate for the treatment of acute bipolar mania (monotherapy and adjunct therapy), 646 patients exposed to quetiapine fumarate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as adjunct therapy, and approximately 2600 patients andor normal subjects exposed to 1 or more doses of quetiapine fumarate for the treatment of schizophrenia. Of these approximately 4300 subjects, approximately 4000 (2300 in schizophrenia, 405 in acute bipolar mania, 698 in bipolar depression, and 646 for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder) were patients who participated in multiple dose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 2400 patientyears. The conditions and duration of treatment with quetiapine fumarate varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) openlabel and doubleblind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixeddose and dosetitration studies, and shortterm or longerterm exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard COSTART terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions for schizophrenia and bipolar mania. MedDRA terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions for bipolar depression. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials in Adults Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia Overall, there was little difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (4 for quetiapine fumarate vs. 3 for placebo) in a pool of controlled trials. However, discontinuations due to somnolence (0.8 quetiapine fumarate vs. 0 placebo) and hypotension (0.4 quetiapine fumarate vs. 0 placebo) were considered to be drug related see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 and 5.16). Bipolar Disorder Mania Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 5.7 for quetiapine fumarate vs. 5.1 for placebo in monotherapy and 3.6 for quetiapine fumarate vs. 5.9 for placebo in adjunct therapy. Depression Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 12.3 for quetiapine fumarate 300 mg vs. 19.0 for quetiapine fumarate 600 mg and 5.2 for placebo. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials In the acute therapy of schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks) and bipolar mania (up to 12 weeks) trials, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine fumarate monotherapy (incidence of 5 or greater) and observed at a rate on quetiapine fumarate at least twice that of placebo were somnolence (18), dizziness (11), dry mouth (9), constipation (8), ALT increased (5), weight gain (5), and dyspepsia (5). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 1 or More Among Quetiapine Fumarate Treated Patients in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied. Table 8 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy of schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks) and bipolar mania (up to 12 weeks) in 1 or more of patients treated with quetiapine fumarate (doses ranging from 75 to 800 mgday) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine fumarate was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Doserelated Adverse Reactions Spontaneously elicited adverse reaction data from a study of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine fumarate (75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 750 mgday) to placebo were explored for doserelatedness of adverse reactions. Logistic regression analyses revealed a positive dose response (p0.05) for the following adverse reactions dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and weight gain. Adverse Reactions in clinical trials with quetiapine and not listed elsewhere in the label The following adverse reactions have also been reported with quetiapine nightmares, hypersensitivity and elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase (not associated with NMS). Extrapyramidal Symptoms Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Adults Data from one 6week clinical trial of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine fumarate (75, 150, 300, 600, 750 mgday) provided evidence for the lack of treatmentemergent extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and doserelatedness for EPS associated with quetiapine fumarate treatment. Three methods were used to measure EPS (1) SimpsonAngus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (3) use of anticholinergic medications to treat emergent EPS.

The rate of anticholinergic medication use to treat emergent EPS for placebo and the five fixed doses was 14 11 10 8 12 and 11. In six additional placebocontrolled clinical trials (3 in acute mania and 3 in schizophrenia) using variable doses of quetiapine fumarate, there were no differences between the quetiapine fumarate and placebo treatment groups in the incidence of EPS, as assessed by SimpsonAngus total scores, spontaneous complaints of EPS and the use of concomitant anticholinergic medications to treat EPS. In two placebocontrolled clinical trials for the treatment of bipolar depression using 300 mg and 600 mg of quetiapine fumarate, the incidence of adverse reactions potentially related to EPS was 12 in both dose groups and 6 in the placebo group. In these studies, the incidence of the individual adverse reactions (akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dyskinesia, dystonia, restlessness, muscle contractions involuntary, psychomotor hyperactivity and muscle rigidity) were generally low and did not exceed 4 in any treatment group. The 3 treatment groups were similar in mean change in SAS total score and BARS Global Assessment score at the end of treatment. The use of concomitant anticholinergic medications was infrequent and similar across the three treatment groups. Children and Adolescents The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine fumarate consisting of over 1000 pediatric patients. This database includes 677 patients exposed to quetiapine fumarate for the treatment of schizophrenia and 393 patients exposed to quetiapine fumarate for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials in Children and Adolescents Adolescents 13 to 17 years of age with Schizophrenia The following findings were based on a 6 week placebocontrolled trial in which quetiapine was administered in either doses of 400 or 800 mgday. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapinetreated and placebotreated patients was 8.2 and 2.7, respectively. The adverse event leading to discontinuation in 1 or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo was somnolence (2.7 and 0 for placebo). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions In therapy for schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks), the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in adolescents (incidence of 5 or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (34), dizziness (12), dry mouth (7), tachycardia ( 7). Table 12 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 6 weeks) of schizophrenia in 5 or more of patients treated with quetiapine fumarate (doses of 400 or 800 mgday) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine fumarate was at least twice the incidence in placebotreated patients. Adverse events that were potentially doserelated with higher frequency in the 800 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included dizziness (8.2 vs. 14.9), dry mouth (4.1 vs. 9.5), and tachycardia (5.5 vs. 8.1).

Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapinetreated and placebotreated patients was 11.4 and 4.4, respectively. The adverse events leading to discontinuation in 1 or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo were somnolence (4.1 vs. 1.1), fatigue (2.1 vs. 0), irritability (1.6 vs. 0) and syncope (1 vs. 0). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions In bipolar mania therapy (up to 3 weeks) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents (incidence of 5 or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (53), dizziness (18), fatigue (11), increased appetite (9), nausea (8), vomiting (8), tachycardia (7), dry mouth (7), and weight increased (6). Table 13 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 3 weeks) of bipolar mania in 5 or more of patients treated with quetiapine fumarate (doses of 400 or 600 mgday) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine fumarate was at least twice the incidence in placebotreated patients. Adverse events that were potentially doserelated with higher frequency in the 600 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included somnolence (49 vs. 57), nausea (6.3 vs. 10.2) and tachycardia (5.3 vs. 8.2).

Increases in blood pressure have also been reported with quetiapine in children and adolescents see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.8, 5.9 and 5.13). Neutrophil Counts In placebocontrolled monotherapy clinical trials involving 3368 patients on quetiapine fumarate and 1515 on placebo, the incidence of at least one occurrence of neutrophil count 1.0 x 109L among patients with a normal baseline neutrophil count and at least one available follow up laboratory measurement was 0.3 (102967) in patients treated with quetiapine fumarate, compared to 0.1 (21349) in patients treated with placebo. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue quetiapine fumrate tablets at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors see Warnings and Precautions (5.10). Decreased Hemoglobin In shortterm placebocontrolled trials, decreases in hemoglobin to  13 gdL males,  12 gdL females on at least one occasion occurred in 8.3 (5947155) of quetiapinetreated patients compared to 6.2 (2193536) of patients treated with placebo. In a database of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, decreases in hemoglobin to  13 gdL males,  12 gdL females on at least one occasion occurred in 11 (227720729) of quetiapinetreated patients. ECG Changes Adults Between group comparisons for pooled placebocontrolled trials revealed no statistically significant quetiapine fumarateplacebo differences in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc, and PR intervals. However, the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia were compared in four 3 to 6 week placebocontrolled clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia revealing a 1 (4399) incidence for quetiapine fumarate compared to 0.6 (1156) incidence for placebo. In acute (monotherapy) bipolar mania trials the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia was 0.5 (1192) for quetiapine fumarate compared to 0 (0178) incidence for placebo. In acute bipolar mania (adjunct) trials the proportions of patients meeting the same criteria was 0.6 (1166) for quetiapine fumarate compared to 0 (0171) incidence for placebo. In bipolar depression trials, no patients had heart rate increases to  120 beats per minute. Quetiapine fumarate use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 7 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute among placebo patients. This slight tendency to tachycardia in adults may be related to quetiapine fumarates potential for inducing orthostatic changes see Warnings and Precautions (5.8). Children and Adolescents In the acute (3 week) bipolar mania trial in children and adolescents, potentially clinically significant increases in heart rate ( 110 bpm) occurred in 1.1 (195) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 2.4 (298) of patients receiving quetiapine 600 mg compared to 0 (098) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 12.8 bpm and 13.4 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 1.7 bpm in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.8). In the acute (3 week) bipolar mania trial in children and adolescents, potentially clinically significant increases in heart rate ( 110 bpm) occurred in 1.1 (195) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 2.4 (298) of patients receiving quetiapine 600 mg compared to 0 (098) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 12.8 bpm and 13.4 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 1.7 bpm in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.8). 6.3 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval of quetiapine fumarate tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction which were temporally related to quetiapine fumarate therapy include anaphylactic reaction and galactorrhea. Other adverse reactions reported since market introduction, which were temporally related to quetiapine fumarate therapy, but not necessarily causally related, include the following agranulocytosis, cardiomyopathy, hyponatremia, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), StevensJohnson syndrome (SJS), and decreased platelets. In postmarketing clinical trials, elevations in total cholesterol (predominantly LDL cholesterol), somnambulism (and other related events) and hypothermia have been reported."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Quetiapine fumarate is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Quetiapine fumarate has not been systematically studied, in animals or humans, for its potential for abuse, tolerance or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNSactive drug will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of quetiapine fumarate tablets, e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior. 9.3 Dependence</td></tr>

Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking quetiapine fumarate tablets. Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine is not approved for elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a daytoday basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Patients should be advised to report to their physician any signs or symptoms that may be related to NMS. These may include muscle stiffness and high fever see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Patients should be aware of the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes, those with risk factors for diabetes, or those that develop these symptoms during treatment should have their blood glucose monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment see Warnings and Precautions (5.4). Hyperlipidemia Patients should be advised that elevations in total cholesterol, LDLcholesterol and triglycerides and decreases in HDLcholesterol may occur. Patients should have their lipid profile monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment see Warnings and Precautions (5.5). Weight Gain Patients should be advised that they may experience weight gain. Patients should have their weight monitored regularly see Warnings and Precautions (5.6). Orthostatic Hypotension Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic hypotension (symptoms include feeling dizzy or lightheaded upon standing, which may lead to falls), especially during the period of initial dose titration, and also at times of reinitiating treatment or increases in dose see Warnings and Precautions (5.8).

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Quetiapine fumarate tablets can be taken with or without food. Quetiapine fumarate tablets can be taken with or without food. Indication Dosing InstructionsAfter initial dosing, adjustments can be made upwards or downwards, if necessary, within the dose range depending upon the clinical response and tolerance of the patient. Recommended DoseDose Range SchizophreniaAdults (2.1) Day 1 25 mg twice daily. Increase in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg divided two or three times on Days 2 and 3 to range of 300 to 400 mg by Day 4. Further adjustments can be made in increments of 25 to 50 mg twice a day, in intervals of not less than 2 days. 150 to 750 mgday Bipolar Mania Adults Monotherapy or as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex (2.2) Day 1 Twice daily dosing totaling 100 mg. Day 2 Twice daily dosing totaling 200 mg. Day 3 Twice daily dosing totaling 300 mg. Day 4 Twice daily dosing totaling 400 mg. Further dosage adjustments up to 800 mgday by Day 6 should be in increments of no greater than 200 mgday. 400 to 800 mgday Bipolar Depression Adults Administer once daily at bedtime. Day 1 50 mg. Day 2 100 mg. Day 3 200 mg. Day 4 300 mg. 300 mgday Bipolar I Disorder Maintenance Therapy Adults Administer twice daily totaling 400 to 800 mgday as adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Generally, in the maintenance phase, patients continued on the same dose on which they were stabilized. 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults Dose SelectionQuetiapine fumarate tablets should generally be administered with an initial dose of 25 mg twice daily, with increases in total daily dose of 25 mg to 50 mg divided in two or three doses on the second and third day, as tolerated, to a total dose range of 300 mg to 400 mg daily by the fourth day. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 2 days, as steadystate for quetiapine fumarate tablets would not be achieved for approximately 1 to 2 days in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 25 mg to 50 mg divided twice daily are recommended. Most efficacy data with quetiapine fumarate tablets were obtained using three times daily dosing regimens, but in one controlled trial 225 mg given twice per day was also effective. Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 150 mgday to 750 mgday in the clinical trials supporting the effectiveness of quetiapine fumarate tablets. In a dose response study, doses above 300 mgday were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 300 mgday dose. In other studies, however, doses in the range of 400 mgday to 500 mgday appeared to be needed. The safety of doses above 800 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Maintenance TreatmentThe effectiveness of quetiapine fumarate tablets for longer than 6 weeks has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with quetiapine fumarate tablets should be maintained, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Adolescents (1317 years) Pediatric dosing information in patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs quetiapine fumarate drug product labeling. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs marketing exclusivity rights this drug product is not labeled for such use in those adolescent patients. 2.2 Bipolar Disorder Adults Acute Treatment of Manic Episodes in Bipolar I Disorder Dose SelectionWhen used as monotherapy or adjunct therapy (with lithium or divalproex), quetiapine fumarate tablets should be initiated in twice daily doses totaling 100 mgday on Day 1, increased to 400 mgday on Day 4 in increments of up to 100 mgday in twice daily divided doses. Further dosage adjustments up to 800 mgday by Day 6 should be in increments of no greater than 200 mgday. Data indicate that the majority of patients responded between 400 mgday to 800 mgday. The safety of doses above 800 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Acute Treatment of Depressive Episodes in Bipolar Disorder Dose SelectionQuetiapine fumarate tablets should be administered once daily at bedtime to reach 300 mgday by Day 4. Recommended Dosing Schedule Day Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets 50 mg 100 mg 200 mg 300 mg In the clinical trials supporting effectiveness, the dosing schedule was 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mgday for Days 1 to 4 respectively. Patients receiving 600 mg increased to 400 mg on Day 5 and 600 mg on Day 8 (Week 1). Antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated with quetiapine fumarate tablets at both 300 mg and 600 mg however, no additional benefit was seen in the 600 mg group. Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder Maintenance of efficacy in bipolar I disorder was demonstrated with quetiapine fumarate tablets (administered twice daily totaling 400 to 800 mg per day) as adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex. Generally, in the maintenance phase, patients continued on the same dose on which they were stabilized during the stabilization phase Children and Adolescents (10 to 17 years) Pediatric dosing information in patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs quetiapine fumarate drug product labeling. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs marketing exclusivity rights this drug product is not labeled for such use in those pediatric patients. 2.3 Dosing in Special Populations Consideration should be given to a slower rate of dose titration and a lower target dose in the elderly and in patients who are debilitated or who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions see Clinical Pharmacology (12). When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Patients with hepatic impairment should be started on 25 mgday. The dose should be increased daily in increments of 25 mgday to 50 mgday to an effective dose, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patient. 2.4 Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that when restarting patients who have had an interval of less than one week off quetiapine fumarate tablets, titration of quetiapine fumarate tablets is not required and the maintenance dose may be reinitiated. When restarting therapy of patients who have been off quetiapine fumarate tablets for more than one week, the initial titration schedule should be followed. 2.5 Switching from Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from antipsychotics to quetiapine fumarate tablets, or concerning concomitant administration with antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients with schizophrenia from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate quetiapine fumarate tablets therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing EPS medication should be reevaluated periodically.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of quetiapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of quetiapine in schizophrenia and its mood stabilizing properties in bipolar depression and mania are mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of quetiapine. Quetiapines antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Quetiapines antagonism of adrenergic 1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of quetiapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of quetiapine in schizophrenia and its mood stabilizing properties in bipolar depression and mania are mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of quetiapine. Quetiapines antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Quetiapines antagonism of adrenergic 1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Quetiapine is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2 (IC50s717  148nM, respectively), dopamine D1 and D2 (IC50s1268  329nM, respectively), histamine H1 (IC5030nM), and adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors (IC50s94  271nM, respectively). Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors (IC50s5000 nM). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Quetiapine fumarate activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multipledose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are doseproportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal halflife of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steadystate concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Children and Adolescents Pharmacokinetic information in patients (10 to 17 years of age) is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs quetiapine fumarate drug product labeling. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs marketing exclusivity rights this drug product is not labeled for such use in those patients. Absorption Quetiapine fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100 bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25 and 15, respectively. Distribution Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 104 Lkg. It is 83 bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. In vitro, quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine. Metabolism and Elimination Following a single oral dose of 14Cquetiapine, less than 1 of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73 and 20 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite Ndesalkyl quetiapine. Age Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40 in elderly patients ( 65 years, n9) compared to young patients (n12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary see Dosage and Administration (2). Gender There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Race There is no race effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Smoking Smoking has no effect on the oral clearance of quetiapine. Renal Insufficiency Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr1030 mLmin1.73 m2, n8) had a 25 lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (Clcr  80 mLmin1.73 m2, n8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with renal insufficiency were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose. Dosage adjustment is therefore not needed in these patients. Hepatic Insufficiency Hepatically impaired patients (n8) had a 30 lower mean oral clearance of quetiapine than normal subjects. In two of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and Cmax were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects. Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed see Dosage and Administration (2). DrugDrug Interactions In vitro enzyme inhibition data suggest that quetiapine and 9 of its metabolites would have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by cytochromes P450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Quetiapine oral clearance is increased by the prototype cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer, phenytoin, and decreased by the prototype cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole. Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is coadministered with phenytoin or ketoconazole see Drug Interactions (7.1). Quetiapine oral clearance is not inhibited by the nonspecific enzyme inhibitor, cimetidine. Quetiapine at doses of 750 mgday did not affect the single dose pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, lithium or lorazepam see Drug Interactions (7.2).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>abuse</i>:</td><td>9.2 Abuse Quetiapine fumarate has not been systematically studied, in animals or humans, for its potential for abuse, tolerance or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNSactive drug will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of quetiapine fumarate tablets, e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Schizophrenia Adults The efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in 3 shortterm (6 week) controlled trials of inpatients with schizophrenia who met DSM IIIR criteria for schizophrenia. Although a single fixed dose haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in one of the three trials, this single haloperidol dose group was inadequate to provide a reliable and valid comparison of quetiapine and haloperidol. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multiitem inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. The results of the trials follow In a 6 week, placebocontrolled trial (n361) involving 5 fixed doses of quetiapine fumarate (75 mgday, 150 mgday, 300 mgday, 600 mgday and 750 mgday given in divided doses three times per day), the 4 highest doses of quetiapine fumarate tablets were generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster and the CGI severity score, with the maximal effect seen at 300 mgday, and the effects of doses of 150 mgday to 750 mgday were generally indistinguishable. In a 6 week, placebocontrolled trial (n286) involving titration of quetiapine fumarate in high (up to 750 mgday given in divided doses three times per day) and low (up to 250 mgday given in divided doses three times per day) doses, only the high dose quetiapine fumarate group (mean dose, 500 mgday) was superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. In a 6 week dose and dose regimen comparison trial (n618) involving two fixed doses of quetiapine fumarate(450 mgday given in divided doses both twice daily and three times daily and 50 mgday given in divided doses twice daily), only the 450 mgday (225 mg given twice daily) dose group was superior to the 50 mgday (25 mg given twice daily) quetiapine fumarate dose group on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. Examination of population subsets (race, gender, and age) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of race or gender, with an apparently greater effect in patients under the age of 40 years compared to those older than 40. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Adolescents (ages 1317) Clinical trial information in patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs quetiapine fumarate drug product labeling. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs marketing exclusivity rights this drug product is not labeled for such use in those adolescent patients. 14.2 Bipolar Disorder Manic Episodes Adults The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate in the acute treatment of manic episodes was established in 3 placebocontrolled trials in patients who met DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and excluded patients with rapid cycling and mixed episodes. Of these trials, 2 were monotherapy (12 weeks) and 1 was adjunct therapy (3 weeks) to either lithium or divalproex. Key outcomes in these trials were change from baseline in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score at 3 and 12 weeks for monotherapy and at 3 weeks for adjunct therapy. Adjunct therapy is defined as the simultaneous initiation or subsequent administration of quetiapine fumarate with lithium or divalproex. The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was YMRS, an 11item clinicianrated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptiveaggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, languagethought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The results of the trials follow Monotherapy The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate in the acute treatment of bipolar mania was established in 2 placebocontrolled trials. In two 12week trials (n300, n299) comparing quetiapine fumarate to placebo, quetiapine fumarate was superior to placebo in the reduction of the YMRS total score at weeks 3 and 12. The majority of patients in these trials taking quetiapine fumarate were dosed in a range between 400 mgday and 800 mg per day. Adjunct Therapy In this 3week placebocontrolled trial, 170 patients with bipolar mania (YMRS  20) were randomized to receive quetiapine fumarate or placebo as adjunct treatment to lithium or divalproex. Patients may or may not have received an adequate treatment course of lithium or divalproex prior to randomization. Quetiapine fumarate was superior to placebo when added to lithium or divalproex alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. The majority of patients in this trial taking quetiapine fumarate tablets were dosed in a range between 400 mgday and 800 mg per day. In a similarly designed trial (n200), quetiapine fumarate was associated with an improvement in YMRS scores but did not demonstrate superiority to placebo, possibly due to a higher placebo effect. Children and Adolescents (ages 1017) Clinical trial use information in patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs quetiapine fumarate drug product labeling. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs marketing exclusivity rights this drug product is not labeled for such use in those pediatric patients. Depressive Episodes Adults The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder was established in 2 identically designed 8week, randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled studies (N1045). These studies included patients with either bipolar I or II disorder and those with or without a rapid cycling course. Patients randomized to quetiapine fumarate were administered fixed doses of either 300 mg or 600 mg once daily. The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in these studies was the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10 item clinicianrated scale with scores ranging from 0 to 60. The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. In both studies, quetiapine fumarate was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score. Improvement in symptoms, as measured by change in MADRS score relative to placebo, was seen in both studies at Day 8 (week 1) and onwards. In these studies, no additional benefit was seen with the 600 mg dose. For the 300 mg dose group, statistically significant improvements over placebo were seen in overall quality of life and satisfaction related to various areas of functioning, as measured using the QLESQ(SF). Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Divalproex The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 placebocontrolled trials in patients (n1326) who met DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder. The trials included patients whose most recent episode was manic, depressed, or mixed, with or without psychotic features. In the openlabel phase, patients were required to be stable on quetiapine fumarate plus lithium or divalproex for at least 12 weeks in order to be randomized. On average, patients were stabilized for 15 weeks. In the randomization phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or divalproex and were randomized to receive either quetiapine fumarate (administered twice daily totaling 400 mgday to 800 mgday) or placebo. Approximately 50 of the patients had discontinued from the quetiapine fumarate group by day 280 and 50 of the placebo group had discontinued by day 117 of doubleblind treatment. The primary endpoint in these studies was time to recurrence of a mood event (manic, mixed or depressed episode). A mood event was defined as medication initiation or hospitalization for a mood episode YMRS score  20 or MADRS score  20 at 2 consecutive assessments or study discontinuation due to a mood event. In both studies, quetiapine fumarate was superior to placebo in increasing the time to recurrence of any mood event. The treatment effect was present for increasing time to recurrence of both manic and depressed episodes. The effect of quetiapine fumarate was independent of any specific subgroup (assigned mood stabilizer, sex, age, race, most recent bipolar episode, or rapid cycling course).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use Consider a lower starting dose (50 mgday), slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period. (8.5) Hepatic Impairment Lower starting doses (25 mgday) and slower titration may be needed. (2.3, 12.3) Pregnancy Limited human data. Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. Quetiapine should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. (8.1) Nursing Mothers Breastfeeding is not recommended. (8.3) Pediatric Use (8.4) Pediatric use information in patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia and patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs quetiapine fumarate drug labeling. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs marketing exclusivity rights this drug product is not labeled for such use in those patients. 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of quetiapine use in pregnant women. In limited published literature, there were no major malformations associated with quetiapine exposure during pregnancy. In animal studies, embryofetal toxicity occurred. Quetiapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are limited published data on the use of quetiapine for treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. In a prospective observational study, 21 women exposed to quetiapine and other psychoactive medications during pregnancy delivered infants with no major malformations. Among 42 other infants born to pregnant women who used quetiapine during pregnancy, there were no major malformations reported (one study of 36 women, 6 case reports). Due to the limited number of exposed pregnancies, these postmarketing data do not reliably estimate the frequency or absence of adverse outcomes. When pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to quetiapine during organogenesis, there was no increase in the incidence of major malformations in fetuses at doses up to 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose for schizophrenia (MRHD, 800 mgday on a mgm2 basis) however, there was evidence of embryofetal toxicity. In rats, delays in skeletal ossification occurred at 0.6 and 2.4 times the MRHD and in rabbits at 1.2 and 2.4 times the MRHD. At 2.4 times the MRHD, there was an increased incidence of carpaltarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses and decreased fetal weights in both species. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weights andor death) occurred at 2.4 times the MRHD in rats and at 0.6 to 2.4 times the MRHD (all doses) in rabbits. In a peripostnatal reproductive study in rats, no drugrelated effects were observed when pregnant dams were treated with quetiapine at doses 0.01, 0.12, and 0.24 times the MRHD. However, in a preliminary peripostnatal study, there were increases in fetal and pup death, and decreases in mean litter weight at 3.0 times the MRHD. NonTeratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including quetiapine), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Quetiapine fumarate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of quetiapine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Quetiapine was excreted into human milk. It is recommended that women receiving quetiapine fumarate tablets should not breastfeed. In published case reports, the level of quetiapine in breast milk ranged from undetectable to 170 gL. The estimated infant dose ranged from 0.09 to 0.43 of the weightadjusted maternal dose. Based on a limited number (N8) of motherinfant pairs, calculated infant daily doses range from less than 0.01 mgkg (at a maternal daily dose up to 100 mg quetiapine) to 0.1 mgkg (at a maternal daily dose of 400 mg). 8.4 Pediatric Use In general, the adverse reactions observed in children and adolescents during the clinical trials were similar to those in the adult population with few exceptions. Increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in children and adolescents and did not occur in adults. Orthostatic hypotension occurred more frequently in adults (4 to 7) compared to children and adolescents ( 1). Schizophrenia Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age with schizophrenia have not been established. Maintenance The safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder has not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia has not been established in any patient population, including pediatric patients. Bipolar Mania Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age with bipolar mania have not been established. Bipolar Depression Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with bipolar depression have not been established. Pediatric use information in patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia, and patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania is approved for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs quetiapine fumarate drug product labeling. However, due to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LPs marketing exclusivity rights this drug product is not labeled for such use in those patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the approximately 3700 patients in clinical studies with quetiapine, 7 (232) were 65 years of age or over. In general, there was no indication of any different tolerability of quetiapine in the elderly compared to younger adults. Nevertheless, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance, increase the pharmacodynamic response to quetiapine, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period in the elderly. The mean plasma clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 30 to 50 in elderly patients when compared to younger patients see Clinical Pharmacology (12) and Dosage and Administration (2).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in C57BL mice and Wistar rats. Quetiapine was administered in the diet to mice at doses of 20, 75, 250, and 750 mgkg and to rats by gavage at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mgkg for two years. These doses are equivalent to 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 times the maximum human dose (800 mgday) on a mgm2 basis (mice) or 0.3, 0.9, and 3.0 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis (rats). There were statistically significant increases in thyroid gland follicular adenomas in male mice at doses of 250 and 750 mgkg or 1.5 and 4.5 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis and in male rats at a dose of 250 mgkg or 3.0 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. Mammary gland adenocarcinomas were statistically significantly increased in female rats at all doses tested (25, 75, and 250 mgkg or 0.3, 0.9, and 3.0 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis). Thyroid follicular cell adenomas may have resulted from chronic stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) resulting from enhanced metabolism and clearance of thyroxine by rodent liver. Changes in TSH, thyroxine, and thyroxine clearance consistent with this mechanism were observed in subchronic toxicity studies in rat and mouse and in a 1 year toxicity study in rat however, the results of these studies were not definitive. The relevance of the increases in thyroid follicular cell adenomas to human risk, through whatever mechanism, is unknown. Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum measurements in a 1 year toxicity study showed that quetiapine increased median serum prolactin levels a maximum of 32 and 13 fold in male and female rats, respectively. Increases in mammary neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and are considered to be prolactinmediated. The relevance of this increased incidence of prolactinmediated mammary gland tumors in rats to human risk is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.14). Mutagenesis The mutagenic potential of quetiapine was tested in six in vitro bacterial gene mutation assays and in an in vitro mammalian gene mutation assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. However, sufficiently high concentrations of quetiapine may not have been used for all tester strains. Quetiapine did produce a reproducible increase in mutations in one Salmonella typhimurium tester strain in the presence of metabolic activation. No evidence of clastogenic potential was obtained in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes or in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats. Impairment of Fertility Quetiapine decreased mating and fertility in male SpragueDawley rats at oral doses of 50 and 150 mgkg or 0.6 and 1.8 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. Drugrelated effects included increases in interval to mate and in the number of matings required for successful impregnation. These effects continued to be observed at 150 mgkg even after a twoweek period without treatment. The noeffect dose for impaired mating and fertility in male rats was 25 mgkg, or 0.3 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. Quetiapine adversely affected mating and fertility in female SpragueDawley rats at an oral dose of 50 mgkg, or 0.6 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. Drugrelated effects included decreases in matings and in matings resulting in pregnancy, and an increase in the interval to mate. An increase in irregular estrus cycles was observed at doses of 10 and 50 mgkg, or 0.1 and 0.6 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. The noeffect dose in female rats was 1 mgkg, or 0.01 times the maximum human dose on a mgm2 basis. 13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology Quetiapine caused a doserelated increase in pigment deposition in thyroid gland in rat toxicity studies which were 4 weeks in duration or longer and in a mouse 2 year carcinogenicity study. Doses were 10 to 250 mgkg in rats, 75 to 750 mgkg in mice these doses are 0.1 to 3.0, and 0.1 to 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (on a mgm2 basis), respectively. Pigment deposition was shown to be irreversible in rats. The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be colocalized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells. The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown. In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1 month, focal triangular cataracts occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mgkg, or 4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis. This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a doserelated reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeatdose dog and monkey studies however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs. The appearance of delta8cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25 reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs. Drugrelated cataracts have not been seen in any other species however, in a 1year study in monkeys, a striated appearance of the anterior lens surface was detected in 27 females at a dose of 225 mgkg or 5.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>WARNING INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIARELATED PSYCHOSIS Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks) largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10 week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine fumarate tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). WARNING INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIARELATED PSYCHOSIS See Full Prescribing Information for complete boxed warning.

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported reactions. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drugs known pharmacological effects, ie, drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension. Patients with preexisting severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose see Warnings and Precautions (5). One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In postmarketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose. There were also very rare reports of overdose of quetiapine alone resulting in death or coma. 10.2 Management of Overdosage In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QTprolonging effects when administered in patients with acute overdosage of quetiapine. Similarly it is reasonable to expect that the alphaadrenergicblocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of quetiapine, resulting in problematic hypotension. There is no specific antidote to quetiapine. Therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be instituted. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids andor sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of quetiapineinduced alpha blockade). In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine, are associated with an increased risk of death causes of death are variable. (5.1) Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Increased the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. (5.2) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring. (5.3) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma and death have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. When starting treatment, patients with diabetes or risk factors for diabetes should undergo blood glucose testing before and during treatment. (5.4) Hyperlipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed. Increases in total cholesterol, LDLcholesterol and triglycerides and decreases in HDLcholesterol have been reported in clinical trials. Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended, including fasting blood lipid testing at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment. (5.5) Weight Gain Patients should receive regular monitoring of weight. (5.6) Tardive Dyskinesia Discontinue if clinically appropriate. (5.7) Orthostatic Hypotension Associated dizziness, tachycardia and syncope may occur especially during the initial dose titration period. (5.8) Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents Blood pressure should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment in children and adolescents. (5.9) Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis have been reported with atypical antipsychotics including quetiapine fumarate tablets. Patients with a preexisting low white cell count (WBC) or a history of leukopenianeutropenia should have complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of treatment and should discontinue quetiapine fumarate at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors. (5.10) Cataracts Lens changes have been observed in patients during longterm quetiapine treatment. Lens examination is recommended when starting treatment and at 6 month intervals during chronic treatment. (5.11) QT Prolongation Postmarketing case show increases in QT interval in patients who overdosed on quetiapine, in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines know to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval. Avoid use with drugs that increase the QT interval and in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval. (5.12) Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and close supervision of high risk patients should accompany drug therapy. (5.21) See Full Prescribing Information for additional WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Quetiapine fumarate tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis (see Boxed Warning ). 5.2 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression andor the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a longstanding concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of shortterm placebocontrolled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Shortterm studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 shortterm trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 shortterm trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drugplacebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. Table 1 Age Range DrugPlacebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo 18 14 additional cases 1824 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 2564 1 fewer case 65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longerterm use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebocontrolled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression andor the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for quetiapine fumarate tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixedmanic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that quetiapine fumarate tablets are approved for use in treating adult bipolar depression. 5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine fumarate. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine fumarate. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported. 5.4 Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatmentemergent hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these parameters should be managed as clinically appropriate. Adults Table 2 Fasting Glucose  Proportion of Patients Shifting to  126 mgdL in ShortTerm ( 12 weeks) PlaceboControlled Studies Laboratory Analyte Category Change (At Least Once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N Patients n () Fasting Glucose Normal to High (100 mgdL to  126 mgdL) Quetiapine 2907 71 (2.4) Placebo 1346 19 (1.4) Borderline to High ( 100 mgdL and  126 mgdL to  126 mgdL) Quetiapine 572 67 (11.7) Placebo 279 33 (11.8) In a 24 week trial (activecontrolled, 115 patients treated with quetiapine fumarate) designed to evaluate glycemic status with oral glucose tolerance testing of all patients, at week 24 the incidence of a treatmentemergent postglucose challenge glucose level  200 mgdL was 1.7 and the incidence of a fasting treatmentemergent blood glucose level  126 mgdL was 2.6. The mean change in fasting glucose from baseline was 3.2 mgdL and mean change in 2 hour glucose from baseline was 1.8 mgdL for quetiapine. In 2 longterm placebocontrolled randomized withdrawal clinical trials for bipolar maintenance, mean exposure of 213 days for quetiapine (646 patients) and 152 days for placebo (680 patients), the mean change in glucose from baseline was 5.0 mgdL for quetiapine and 0.05 mgdL for placebo. The exposureadjusted rate of any increased blood glucose level ( 126 mgdL) for patients more than 8 hours since a meal (however, some patients may not have been precluded from calorie intake from fluids during fasting period) was 18.0 per 100 patient years for quetiapine (10.7 of patients n556) and 9.5 for placebo per 100 patient years (4.6 of patients n581). Children and Adolescents In a placebocontrolled quetiapine monotherapy study of adolescent patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia (6 weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose levels for quetiapine (n138) compared to placebo (n67) was 0.75 mgdL versus 1.70 mgdL. In a placebo controlled quetiapine monotherapy study of children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania (3 weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose level for quetiapine (n170) compared to placebo (n81) was 3.62 mgdL versus 1.17 mgdL. No patient in either study with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (100 mgdL) or a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (100 mgdL and 126 mgdL) had a treatmentemergent blood glucose level of 126 mgdL. 5.5 Hyperlipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed with quetiapine use. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic followup lipid evaluations in patients using quetiapine is recommended. In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these parameters should be managed as clinically appropriate. Adults Table 3 shows the percentage of adult patients with changes in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDLcholesterol and HDLcholesterol from baseline by indication in clinical trials with quetiapine fumarate.

Patients receiving quetiapine should receive regular monitoring of weight see Patient Counseling Information (17). In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these parameters should be managed as clinically appropriate. Adults In clinical trials with quetiapine fumarate the following increases in weight have been reported.

Table 6 Proportion of Patients with Weight Gain 7 of Body Weight (Children and Adolescents) Vital Sign Indication Treatment Arm N Patients n () Weight Gain 7 of Body Weight Schizophrenia 6 weeks duration Quetiapine Fumarate 111 23 (21) Placebo 44 3 (7) Bipolar Mania 3 weeks duration Quetiapine Fumarate 157 18 (12) Placebo 68 0 (0) The mean change in body weight in the schizophrenia trial was 2.0 kg in the quetiapine fumarate group and 0.4 kg in the placebo group and in the bipolar mania trial it was 1.7 kg in the quetiapine fumarate group and 0.4 kg in the placebo group. In an openlabel study that enrolled patients from the above two pediatric trials, 63 of patients (241380) completed 26 weeks of therapy with quetiapine fumarate. After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean increase in body weight was 4.4 kg. Fortyfive percent of the patients gained  7 of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. In order to adjust for normal growth over 26 weeks an increase of at least 0.5 standard deviation from baseline in BMI was used as a measure of a clinically significant change 18.3 of patients on Quetiapine fumarate met this criterion after 26 weeks of treatment. When treating pediatric patients with quetiapine fumarate for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected for normal growth. 5.7 Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, quetiapine fumarate should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on quetiapine fumarate, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with quetiapine fumarate despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.8 Orthostatic Hypotension Quetiapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its 1adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 1 (283265) of the patients treated with quetiapine fumarate, compared with 0.2 (2954) on placebo and about 0.4 (2527) on active control drugs. Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope may lead to falls. Quetiapine fumarate should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia and treatment with antihypertensive medications) see Adverse Reactions (6.2). The risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 25 mg twice daily see Dosage and Administration (2). If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration schedule is appropriate. 5.9 Increases in Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents In placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (6 week duration) or bipolar mania (3 week duration), the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (20 mmHg) was 15.2 (51335) for quetiapine fumarate and 5.5 (9163) for placebo the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (10 mmHg) was 40.6 (136335) for quetiapine fumarate and 24.5 (40163) for placebo. In the 26 week openlabel clinical trial, one child with a reported history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis. Blood pressure in children and adolescents should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment. 5.10 Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to atypical antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine fumarate. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue quetiapine fumarate at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm3) should discontinue quetiapine fumarate and have their WBC followed until recovery see Adverse Reactions (6.2). 5.11 Cataracts The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies see Nonclinical Toxicology, Animal Toxicology (13.2). Lens changes have also been observed in adults, children and adolescents during longterm quetiapine treatment, but a causal relationship to quetiapine use has not been established. Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as slit lamp exam or other appropriately sensitive methods, is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6month intervals during chronic treatment. 5.12 QT Prolongation In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine see Overdosage (10.1), in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval see Drug Interactions (7). The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone). Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes andor sudden death including (1) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g. cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure and heart hypertrophy). 5.13 Seizures During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.5 (203490) of patients treated with quetiapine fumarate compared to 0.2 (2954) on placebo and 0.7 (4527) on active control drugs. As with other antipsychotics, quetiapine fumarate should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimers dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.14 Hypothyroidism Adults Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated a doserelated decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine (T4) of approximately 20 at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T4, irrespective of the duration of treatment. About 0.7 (263489) of quetiapine patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment. In the mania adjunct studies, where quetiapine was added to lithium or divalproex, 12 (24196) of quetiapinetreated patients compared to 7 (15203) of placebotreated patients had elevated TSH levels. Of the quetiatpinetreated patients with elevated TSH levels, 3 had simultaneous low free T4 levels. In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of potentially clinically significant shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH were decrease in free T4, 2.0 (35717513) decrease in total T4, 4.0 (751861) decrease in free T3, 0.4 (5313766) decrease in total T3, 2.0 (261312), and increase in TSH, 4.9 (95619412). In eight patients, where TBG was measured, levels of TBG were unchanged. Table 7 shows the incidence of these shifts in shortterm placebocontrolled clinical trials. Table 7 Incidence of potentially clinically significant shifts in thyroid hormone levels and TSH in short term placebocontrolled clinical trialsBased on shifts from normal baseline to potentially clinically important value at anytime postbaseline. Shifts in total T4, free T4, total T3 and free T3 are defined as 0.8 x LLN (pmolL) and shift in TSH is  5 mIUL at any time. Total T4 Free T4 Total T3 Free T3 TSH Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo 3.4  (371097) 0.6 (4651) 0.7 (527218) 0.1 (43668) 0.5 (2369) 0.0 (0113) 0.2 (115673) 0.0 (12679) 3.2 (2407587) 2.7 (1053912) In shortterm placebocontrolled monotherapy trials, the incidence of reciprocal, potentially clinically significant shifts in T3 and TSH was 0.0  for both quetiapine (14800) and placebo (02190) and for T4 and TSH the shifts were 0.1 (76154) for quetiapine versus 0.0 (13007) for placebo. Generally, these changes in thyroid hormone levels were of no clinical significance. Children and Adolescents In acute placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescent patients with schizophrenia (6 week duration) or bipolar mania (3 week duration), the incidence of shifts to potentially clinically important thyroid function values at any time for quetiapine treated patients and placebotreated patients for elevated TSH was 2.9 (8280) vs. 0.7 (1138), respectively and for decreased total thyroxine was 2.8 (8289) vs. 0 (0145, respectively). Of the quetiapine treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 1 had simultaneous low free T4 level at end of treatment. 5.15 Hyperprolactinemia Adults During clinical trials with quetiapine, the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a clinically significant value occurred in 3.6 (1584416) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 2.6 (511968) on placebo. Children and Adolescents In acute placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescent patients with bipolar mania (3 week duration) or schizophrenia (6 week duration), the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a clinically significant value (20 gL males  26 gL females at any time) was 13.4 (18134) for quetiapine compared to 4 (375) for placebo in males and 8.7 (9104) for quetiapine compared to 0 (039) for placebo in females. Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, quetiapine elevates prolactin levels in some patients and the elevation may persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactinelevating compounds. Longstanding hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility (13.1). 5.16 Transaminase Elevations Asymptomatic, transient and reversible elevations in serum transaminases (primarily ALT) have been reported. In schizophrenia trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of  3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3 to 6 week placebocontrolled trials were approximately 6 (29483) for quetiapine fumarate compared to 1 (3194) for placebo. In acute bipolar mania trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of  3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3 to 12 week placebocontrolled trials were approximately 1 for both quetiapine fumarate (3560) and placebo (3294). These hepatic enzyme elevations usually occurred within the first 3 weeks of drug treatment and promptly returned to prestudy levels with ongoing treatment with quetiapine fumarate. In bipolar depression trials, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of  3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in two 8 week placebocontrolled trials was 1 (5698) for quetiapine fumarate and 2 (6347) for placebo. 5.17 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse event reported in patients treated with quetiapine fumarate especially during the 35 day period of initial dosetitration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 18 (89510) of patients on quetiapine fumarate compared to 11 (22206) of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine fumarate as monotherapy, somnolence was reported in 16 (34209) of patients on quetiapine fumarate compared to 4 of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine fumarate as adjunct therapy, somnolence was reported in 34 (66196) of patients on quetiapine fumarate compared to 9 (19203) of placebo patients. In bipolar depression trials, somnolence was reported in 57 (398698) of patients on quetiapine fumarate compared to 15 (51347) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine fumarate has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine fumarate therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls. 5.18 Priapism One case of priapism in a patient receiving quetiapine fumarate has been reported prior to market introduction. While a causal relationship to use of quetiapine fumarate has not been established, other drugs with alphaadrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism, and it is possible that quetiapine fumarate may share this capacity. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention. 5.19 Body Temperature Regulation Although not reported with quetiapine fumarate, disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing quetiapine fumarate tablets for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration. 5.20 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimers dementia. Quetiapine fumarate and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. 5.21 Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia close supervision of high risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for quetiapine fumarate should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose. In two 8 week clinical studies in patients with bipolar depression (N1048), the incidence of treatment emergent suicidal ideation or suicide attempt was low and similar to placebo (quetiapine fumarate 300 mg, 6350, 1.7 quetiapine fumarate 600 mg, 9348, 2.6 Placebo, 7347, 2.0). 5.22 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with quetiapine fumarate in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited see Pharmacokinetics (12.3). Quetiapine fumarate has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Because of the risk of orthostatic hypotension with quetiapine fumarate, caution should be observed in cardiac patients see Warnings and Precautions (5.8). 5.23 Withdrawal Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine fumarate. In shortterm placebocontrolled, monotherapy clinical trials with quetiapine fumarate extendedrelease tablets that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1 (2411993) for quetiapine fumarate extendedrelease tablets and 6.7 (711065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse events (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness and irritability) did not exceed 5.3 in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1 week postdiscontinuation. Gradual withdrawal is advised."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>animal_pharmacology_and_or_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology Quetiapine caused a doserelated increase in pigment deposition in thyroid gland in rat toxicity studies which were 4 weeks in duration or longer and in a mouse 2 year carcinogenicity study. Doses were 10 to 250 mgkg in rats, 75 to 750 mgkg in mice these doses are 0.1 to 3.0, and 0.1 to 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (on a mgm2 basis), respectively. Pigment deposition was shown to be irreversible in rats. The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be colocalized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells. The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown. In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1 month, focal triangular cataracts occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mgkg, or 4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis. This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a doserelated reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeatdose dog and monkey studies however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs. The appearance of delta8cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25 reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs. Drugrelated cataracts have not been seen in any other species however, in a 1year study in monkeys, a striated appearance of the anterior lens surface was detected in 27 females at a dose of 225 mgkg or 5.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>Drug Interactions Section The risks of using olanzapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Diazepam  The coadministration of diazepam with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine see Drug Interactions (7.2) . Cimetidine and Antacids  Single doses of cimetidine (800 mg) or aluminum and magnesiumcontaining antacids did not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine. Inducers of CYP1A2  Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50 increase in the clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance. Alcohol  Ethanol (45 mg70 kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The coadministration of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine see Drug Interactions (7.2) . Inhibitors of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine Fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine C max following fluvoxamine of 54 in female nonsmokers and 77 in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC is 52 and 108, respectively. Lower doses of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Fluoxetine Fluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax. Warfarin  Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics see Drug Interactions (7.2) . Inducers of CYP1A2 or Glucuronyl Transferase  Omeprazole and rifampin may cause an increase in olanzapine clearance. Charcoal  The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the C max and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose. CNS Acting Drugs  Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when olanzapine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Antihypertensive Agents  Olanzapine, because of its potential for inducing hypotension, may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists  Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Lithium  Multiple doses of olanzapine (10 mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) . Valproate  Olanzapine (10 mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of valproate. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) . Effect of Olanzapine on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes  In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes. Imipramine  Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolite desipramine. Warfarin  Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin see Drug Interactions (7.1) . Diazepam  Olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam or its active metabolite Ndesmethyldiazepam. However, diazepam coadministered with olanzapine increased the orthostatic hypotension observed with either drug given alone see Drug Interactions (7.1) . Alcohol  Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of ethanol see Drug Interactions (7.1) . Biperiden  Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of biperiden. Theophylline  Multiple doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline or its metabolites.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>Drug Abuse And Dependence Section In studies prospectively designed to assess abuse and dependence potential, olanzapine was shown to have acute depressive CNS effects but little or no potential of abuse or physical dependence in rats administered oral doses up to 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (20 mg) and rhesus monkeys administered oral doses up to 8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis. Olanzapine has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic, and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNSactive drug will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of olanzapine (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior).</td></tr>

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Adults The information below for olanzapine is derived from a clinical trial database for olanzapine consisting of 8661 adult patients with approximately 4165 patientyears of exposure to oral olanzapine and 722 patients with exposure to intramuscular olanzapine for injection. This database includes (1) 2500 patients who participated in multipledose oral olanzapine premarketing trials in schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease representing approximately 1122 patientyears of exposure as of February 14, 1995 (2) 182 patients who participated in oral olanzapine premarketing bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials representing approximately 66 patientyears of exposure (3) 191 patients who participated in an oral olanzapine trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimers disease representing approximately 29 patientyears of exposure (4) 5788 patients from 88 additional oral olanzapine clinical trials as of December 31, 2001 and (5) 722 patients who participated in intramuscular olanzapine for injection premarketing trials in agitated patients with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), or dementia. In addition, information from the premarketing 6week clinical study database for olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, consisting of 224 patients who participated in bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials with approximately 22 patientyears of exposure, is included below. The conditions and duration of treatment with olanzapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) openlabel and doubleblind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixeddose and dosetitration studies, and shortterm or longerterm exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analytes, ECGs, chest xrays, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Certain portions of the discussion below relating to objective or numeric safety parameters, namely, dosedependent adverse reactions, vital sign changes, weight gain, laboratory changes, and ECG changes are derived from studies in patients with schizophrenia and have not been duplicated for bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) or agitation. However, this information is also generally applicable to bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) and agitation. Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, MedDRA and COSTART Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. The reported reactions do not include those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not be repeated below. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions occurred during treatment with olanzapine, they were not necessarily caused by it. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of olanzapine. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reactions incidence in the population studied. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled and Combination Trials The following findings are based on premarketing trials of oral olanzapine for schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), a subsequent trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimers disease, and premarketing combination trials. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Schizophrenia  Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (5 for oral olanzapine vs 6 for placebo). However, discontinuations due to increases in ALT were considered to be drug related (2 for oral olanzapine vs 0 for placebo). Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Monotherapy  Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (2 for oral olanzapine vs 2 for placebo). Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm Combination Trials Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes), Olanzapine as Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate  In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 11 for the combination of oral olanzapine with lithium or valproate compared to 2 for patients who remained on lithium or valproate monotherapy. Discontinuations with the combination of oral olanzapine and lithium or valproate that occurred in more than 1 patient were somnolence (3), weight gain (1), and peripheral edema (1). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of oral olanzapine (incidence of 5 or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebotreated patients (olanzapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were Table 9 Common TreatmentEmergent Adverse Reactions Associated with the Use of Oral Olanzapine in 6Week Trials  SCHIZOPHRENIA Percentage of Patients Reporting Event Adverse Reaction Olanzapine (N248) Placebo (N118) Postural hypotension 5 2 Constipation 9 3 Weight gain 6 1 Dizziness 11 4 Personality disorder 8 4 Akathisia 5 1 Personality disorder is the COSTART term for designating nonaggressive objectionable behavior.

Dystonia, Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, the frequency and severity are greater with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. In general, an elevated risk of acute dystonia may be observed in males and younger age groups receiving antipsychotics however, events of dystonia have been reported infrequently (1) with olanzapine use. Other Adverse Reactions The following table addresses dose relatedness for other adverse reactions using data from a schizophrenia trial involving fixed dosage ranges of oral olanzapine. It enumerates the percentage of patients with treatmentemergent adverse reactions for the 3 fixeddose range groups and placebo. The data were analyzed using the CochranArmitage test, excluding the placebo group, and the table includes only those adverse reactions for which there was a trend.

Mean baseline to endpoint increase in weight (10 mgday 1.9 kg 20 mgday 2.3 kg 40 mgday 3 kg) was observed with significant differences between 10 vs 40 mgday. Incidence of treatmentemergent prolactin elevation 24.2 ngmL (female) or 18.77 ngmL (male) at any time during the trial (10 mgday 31.2 20 mgday 42.7 40 mgday 61.1) with significant differences between 10 vs 40 mgday and 20 vs 40 mgday fatigue (10 mgday 1.5 20 mgday 2.1 40 mgday 6.6) with significant differences between 10 vs 40 and 20 vs 40 mgday and dizziness (10 mgday 2.6 20 mgday 1.6 40 mgday 6.6) with significant differences between 20 vs 40 mg, was observed. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Oral Olanzapine Following is a list of treatmentemergent adverse reactions reported by patients treated with oral olanzapine (at multiple doses 1 mgday) in clinical trials. This listing is not intended to include reactions (1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, (2) for which a drug cause was remote, (3) which were so general as to be uninformative, (4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or (5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Reactions are classified by body system using the following definitions frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1100 patients infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1100 to 11000 patients rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 11000 patients. Body as a Whole  Infrequent chills, face edema, photosensitivity reaction, suicide attempt 1  Rare chills and fever, hangover effect, sudden death 1 .

Table 22 TreatmentEmergent Adverse Reactions of 2 Incidence among Adolescents (13 to 17 Years Old) (Combined Incidence from ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Clinical Trials of Schizophrenia or Bipolar I Disorder Manic or Mixed Episodes) Percentage of Patients Reporting Event Adverse Reaction Olanzapine (N179) Placebo (N89) Sedation 44 9 Weight increased 30 6 Increased appetite 24 6 Headache 17 12 Fatigue 9 4 Dizziness 7 2 Dry mouth 6 0 Pain in extremity 5 1 Constipation 4 0 Nasopharyngitis 4 2 Diarrhea 3 0 Restlessness 3 2 Liver enzymes increased 8 1 Dyspepsia 3 1 Epistaxis 3 0 Respiratory tract infection 3 2 Sinusitis 3 0 Arthralgia 2 0 Musculoskeletal stiffness 2 0 Patients with the following MedDRA terms were counted in this category hypersomnia, lethargy, sedation, somnolence. The terms alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and hepatic enzyme were combined under liver enzymes. Patients with the following MedDRA terms were counted in this category lower respiratory tract infection, respiratory tract infection, respiratory tract infection viral, upper respiratory tract infection, viral upper respiratory tract infection. Vital Sign Changes  Oral olanzapine was associated with orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia in clinical trials see Warnings and Precautions (5) . Laboratory Changes Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults An assessment of the premarketing experience for olanzapine revealed an association with asymptomatic increases in ALT, AST, and GGT. Within the original premarketing database of about 2400 adult patients with baseline ALT 90 IUL, the incidence of ALT elevations to 200 IUL was 2 (502381). None of these patients experienced jaundice or other symptoms attributable to liver impairment and most had transient changes that tended to normalize while olanzapine treatment was continued. In placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adults, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from 3 times the upper limit of normal ULN at baseline to 3 times ULN) were observed in 5 (771426) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 1 (101187) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations 5 times ULN were observed in 2 (291438) of olanzapinetreated patients, compared to 0.3 (41196) of placebotreated patients. ALT values returned to normal, or were decreasing, at last followup in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine. No patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice, liver failure, or met the criteria for Hys Rule. Rare postmarketing reports of hepatitis have been received. Very rare cases of cholestatic or mixed liver injury have also been reported in the postmarketing period. Caution should be exercised in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment, in patients with preexisting conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve, and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Olanzapine administration was also associated with increases in serum prolactin see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , with an asymptomatic elevation of the eosinophil count in 0.3 of patients, and with an increase in CPK. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents In placebocontrolled clinical trials of adolescent patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), greater frequencies for the following treatmentemergent findings, at anytime, were observed in laboratory analytes compared to placebo elevated ALT (3X ULN in patients with ALT at baseline 3X ULN), (12 vs 2) elevated AST (28 vs 4) low total bilirubin (22 vs 7) elevated GGT (10 vs 1) and elevated prolactin (47 vs 7). In placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescents, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from 3 times ULN at baseline to 3 times ULN) were observed in 12 (22192) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 2 (2109) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations 5 times ULN were observed in 4 (8192) of olanzapinetreated patients, compared to 1 (1109) of placebotreated patients. ALT values returned to normal, or were decreasing, at last followup in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine. No adolescent patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice, liver failure, or met the criteria for Hys Rule. ECG Changes  In pooled studies of adults as well as pooled studies of adolescents, there were no significant differences between olanzapine and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc (Fridericia corrected), and PR intervals. Olanzapine use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo (adults 2.4 beats per minute vs no change with placebo adolescents 6.3 beats per minute vs 5.1 beats per minute with placebo). This increase in heart rate may be related to olanzapines potential for inducing orthostatic changes see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) . The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of olanzapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to olanzapine therapy include the following allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, pruritus or urticaria), diabetic coma, diabetic ketoacidosis, discontinuation reaction (diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting), jaundice, neutropenia, pancreatitis, priapism, rash, rhabdomyolysis, and venous thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis). Random cholesterol levels of 240 mgdL and random triglyceride levels of 1000 mgdL have been reported.</td></tr>

(2.1) Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in Combination Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should be made with the individual components according to efficacy and tolerability. (2.5) Olanzapine monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. (2.5) Safety of coadministration of doses above 18 mg olanzapine with 75 mg fluoxetine has not been evaluated. (2.5) Adults Dose Selection  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mgday within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 5 mg QD are recommended. Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mgday in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mgday were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mgday dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mgday (i.e., to a dose of 15 mgday or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mgday. Dosing in Special Populations  The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g., nonsmoking female patients 65 years of age), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Maintenance Treatment  The effectiveness of oral olanzapine, 10 mgday to 20 mgday, in maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable on olanzapine for approximately 8 weeks and were then followed for relapse has been demonstrated in a placebocontrolled trial see Clinical Studies (14.1) . The physician who elects to use olanzapine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Adolescents Pediatric dosing information in pediatric patients with schizophrenia is approved for Eli Lilly and Companys olanzapine drug product labeling. However, due to Eli Lilly and Companys marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Adults Dose Selection for Monotherapy  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 10 or 15 mg. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours, reflecting the procedures in the placebocontrolled trials. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 5 mg QD are recommended. Shortterm (3 to 4 weeks) antimanic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mgday in clinical trials. The safety of doses above 20 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.2) . Maintenance Monotherapy  The benefit of maintaining bipolar I patients on monotherapy with oral olanzapine at a dose of 5 to 20 mgday, after achieving a responder status for an average duration of 2 weeks, was demonstrated in a controlled trial see Clinical Studies (14.2) . The physician who elects to use olanzapine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Dose Selection for Adjunctive Treatment  When administered as adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproate, oral olanzapine dosing should generally begin with 10 mg onceaday without regard to meals. Antimanic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mgday in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.2) . The safety of doses above 20 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials.

However, due to Eli Lilly and Companys marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Clinical Studies section of the package insert for Symbyax. Oral olanzapine should be administered in combination with fluoxetine once daily in the evening, without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 mg of oral olanzapine and 20 mg of fluoxetine. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, can be made according to efficacy and tolerability within dose ranges of oral olanzapine 5 mg to 12.5 mg and fluoxetine 20 mg to 50 mg. Antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in adult patients with a dose range of olanzapine 6 mg to 12 mg and fluoxetine 25 mg to 50 mg. Safety and efficacy of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination was determined in clinical trials supporting approval of Symbyax (fixed dose combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine). Symbyax is dosed between 3 mg25 mg (olanzapinefluoxetine) per day and 12 mg50 mg (olanzapinefluoxetine) per day. The following table demonstrates the appropriate individual component doses of olanzapine and fluoxetine versus Symbyax. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should be made with the individual components according to efficacy and tolerability.

The physician should periodically reexamine the need for continued pharmacotherapy. Safety of coadministration of doses above 18 mg olanzapine with 75 mg fluoxetine has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Olanzapine monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. The starting dose of oral olanzapine 2.5 mg to 5 mg with fluoxetine 20 mg should be used for patients with a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, patients with hepatic impairment, or patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may slow the metabolism of olanzapine or fluoxetine in combination (female gender, geriatric age, nonsmoking status), or those patients who may be pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may slow metabolism. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination have not been systematically studied in patients over 65 years of age or in patients 18 years of age see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>Clinical Pharmacology Section The mechanism of action of olanzapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drugs efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. The mechanism of action of olanzapine in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder is unknown. Olanzapine binds with high affinity to the following receptors serotonin 5HT 2A2C , 5HT 6 (K i 4, 11, and 5 nM, respectively), dopamine D 14 (K i 11 to 31 nM), histamine H 1 (K i 7 nM), and adrenergic  1 receptors (K i 19 nM). Olanzapine is an antagonist with moderate affinity binding for serotonin 5HT 3 (K i 57 nM) and muscarinic M 15 (K i 73, 96, 132, 32, and 48 nM, respectively). Olanzapine binds weakly to GABA A , BZD, and adrenergic receptors (K i 10 M). Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT 2 may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of olanzapine. Olanzapines antagonism of muscarinic M 15 receptors may explain its anticholinergiclike effects. Olanzapines antagonism of histamine H 1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Olanzapines antagonism of adrenergic  1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. Oral Administration, Monotherapy  Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentrations in approximately 6 hours following an oral dose. It is eliminated extensively by first pass metabolism, with approximately 40 of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Food does not affect the rate or extent of olanzapine absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that olanzapine tablets and olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets dosage forms of olanzapine are bioequivalent. Olanzapine displays linear kinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its halflife ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile mean of 30 hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 Lhr (5th to 95th percentile mean of 25 Lhr). Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steadystate concentrations in about 1 week that are approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, halflife, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age. Olanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000 L. It is 93 bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100 ngmL, binding primarily to albumin and  1 acid glycoprotein. Metabolism and Elimination  Following a single oral dose of 14 C labeled olanzapine, 7 of the dose of olanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57 and 30 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12 of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10Nglucuronide, present at steady state at 44 of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4Ndesmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31 of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed. Direct glucuronidation and cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavincontaining monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in vivo , because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme. Specific Populations Renal Impairment  Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7 of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of renal impairment on metabolite elimination has not been studied. Hepatic Impairment  Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (n6) with clinically significant (Childs Pugh Classification A and B) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. Geriatric  In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination halflife of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly (65 years) than in nonelderly subjects (65 years). Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, especially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism andor pharmacodynamic sensitivity see Dosage and Administration (2) . Gender  Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30 lower in women than in men. There were, however, no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed. Smoking Status  Olanzapine clearance is about 40 higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications are not routinely recommended. Race  In vivo studies have shown that exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight differences. Dosage modifications for race are, therefore, not recommended. Combined Effects  The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences in populations. The clearance in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine see Dosage and Administration (2) .

However, due to Eli Lilly and Companys marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>Clinical Studies Section When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Clinical Studies section of the package insert for Symbyax. Adults The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in 2 shortterm (6week) controlled trials of adult inpatients who met DSM IIIR criteria for schizophrenia. A single haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in 1 of the 2 trials, but this trial did not compare these 2 drugs on the full range of clinically relevant doses for both. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multiitem inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, 2 more recently developed scales were employed these included the 30item Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), in which are embedded the 18 items of the BPRS, and the Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS). The trial summaries below focus on the following outcomes PANSS total andor BPRS total BPRS psychosis cluster PANSS negative subscale or SANS and CGI Severity. The results of the trials follow (1) In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n149) involving 2 fixed olanzapine doses of 1 and 10 mgday (once daily schedule), olanzapine, at 10 mgday (but not at 1 mgday), was superior to placebo on the PANSS total score (also on the extracted BPRS total), on the BPRS psychosis cluster, on the PANSS Negative subscale, and on CGI Severity. (2) In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n253) involving 3 fixed dose ranges of olanzapine (5  2.5 mgday, 10  2.5 mgday, and 15  2.5 mgday) on a once daily schedule, the 2 highest olanzapine dose groups (actual mean doses of 12 and 16 mgday, respectively) were superior to placebo on BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score the highest olanzapine dose group was superior to placebo on the SANS. There was no clear advantage for the highdose group over the mediumdose group. (3) In a longerterm trial, adult outpatients (n326) who predominantly met DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia and who remained stable on olanzapine during openlabel treatment for at least 8 weeks were randomized to continuation on their current olanzapine doses (ranging from 10 to 20 mgday) or to placebo. The followup period to observe patients for relapse, defined in terms of increases in BPRS positive symptoms or hospitalization, was planned for 12 months, however, criteria were met for stopping the trial early due to an excess of placebo relapses compared to olanzapine relapses, and olanzapine was superior to placebo on time to relapse, the primary outcome for this study. Thus, olanzapine was more effective than placebo at maintaining efficacy in patients stabilized for approximately 8 weeks and followed for an observation period of up to 8 months. Examination of population subsets (race and gender) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings. Adolescents Clinical trial information in pediatric patients with schizophrenia is approved for Eli Lilly and Companys olanzapine drug product labeling. However, due to Eli Lilly and Companys marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Adults Monotherapy  The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 shortterm (one 3week and one 4week) placebocontrolled trials in adult patients who met the DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapidcycling course. The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), an 11item clinicianrated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptiveaggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, languagethought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary outcome in these trials was change from baseline in the YMRS total score. The results of the trials follow (1) In one 3week placebocontrolled trial (n67) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5 to 20 mgday, once daily, starting at 10 mgday), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score. In an identically designed trial conducted simultaneously with the first trial, olanzapine demonstrated a similar treatment difference, but possibly due to sample size and site variability, was not shown to be superior to placebo on this outcome. (2) In a 4week placebocontrolled trial (n115) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5 to 20 mgday, once daily, starting at 15 mgday), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score. (3) In another trial, 361 patients meeting DSMIV criteria for a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder who had responded during an initial openlabel treatment phase for about 2 weeks, on average, to olanzapine 5 to 20 mgday were randomized to either continuation of olanzapine at their same dose (n225) or to placebo (n136), for observation of relapse. Approximately 50 of the patients had discontinued from the olanzapine group by day 59 and 50 of the placebo group had discontinued by day 23 of doubleblind treatment. Response during the openlabel phase was defined by having a decrease of the YMRS total score to 12 and HAMD 21 to 8. Relapse during the doubleblind phase was defined as an increase of the YMRS or HAMD 21 total score to 15, or being hospitalized for either mania or depression. In the randomized phase, patients receiving continued olanzapine experienced a significantly longer time to relapse. Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate  The efficacy of oral olanzapine with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 controlled trials in patients who met the DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapidcycling course. The results of the trials follow (1) In one 6week placebocontrolled combination trial, 175 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (YMRS 16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, in combination with their original therapy. Olanzapine (in a dose range of 5 to 20 mgday, once daily, starting at 10 mgday) combined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEqL to 1.2 mEqL or 50 mcgmL to 125 mcgmL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. (2) In a second 6week placebocontrolled combination trial, 169 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (YMRS 16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, in combination with their original therapy. Olanzapine (in a dose range of 5 to 20 mgday, once daily, starting at 10 mgday) combined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEqL to 1.2 mEqL or 50 mcgmL to 125 mcgmL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of YMRS total score.

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>Use In Specific Populations Section When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Use in Specific Populations section of the package insert for Symbyax. Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C  In oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 18 mgkgday and in rabbits at doses up to 30 mgkgday (9 and 30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis, respectively) no evidence of teratogenicity was observed. In an oral rat teratology study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose of 18 mgkgday (9 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis). Gestation was prolonged at 10 mgkgday (5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis). In an oral rabbit teratology study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of 30 mgkgday (30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Placental transfer of olanzapine occurs in rat pups. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials with olanzapine in pregnant females. Seven pregnancies were observed during clinical trials with olanzapine, including 2 resulting in normal births, 1 resulting in neonatal death due to a cardiovascular defect, 3 therapeutic abortions, and 1 spontaneous abortion. Nonteratogenic Effects, Class Effect  Extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms have been reported following delivery in neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including olanzapine) during the third trimester of pregnancy. These reports include agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Olanzapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The effect of olanzapine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Parturition in rats was not affected by olanzapine. In a study in lactating, healthy women, olanzapine was excreted in breast milk. Mean infant dose at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose. It is recommended that women receiving olanzapine should not breastfeed. Compared to patients from adult clinical trials, adolescents were likely to gain more weight, experience increased sedation, and have greater increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, prolactin and hepatic transaminase levels see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6, 5.15, 5.17) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) . When deciding among the alternative treatments available for adolescents, clinicians should consider the increased potential (in adolescents as compared with adults) for weight gain and hyperlipidemia. Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine in children 13 years of age have not been established see Patient Counseling Information (17.13) . Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in children and adolescents 18 years of age have not been established. Pediatric use information in pediatric patients with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is approved for Eli Lilly and Companys olanzapine drug product labeling. However, due to Eli Lilly and Companys marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Of the 2500 patients in premarketing clinical studies with oral olanzapine, 11 (263) were 65 years of age or over. In patients with schizophrenia, there was no indication of any different tolerability of olanzapine in the elderly compared to younger patients. Studies in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile in this population compared to younger patients with schizophrenia. Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. In placebocontrolled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis. Also, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance or increase the pharmacodynamic response to olanzapine should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose for any geriatric patient see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . Clinical studies of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>Nonclinical Toxicology Section Carcinogenesis  Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to mice in two 78week studies at doses of 3, 10, 3020 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.8 to 5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis) and 0.25, 2, 8 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.06 to 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis). Rats were dosed for 2 years at doses of 0.25, 1, 2.5, 4 mgkgday (males) and 0.25, 1, 4, 8 mgkgday (females) (equivalent to 0.13 to 2 and 0.13 to 4 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis, respectively). The incidence of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas was significantly increased in 1 mouse study in female mice dosed at 8 mgkgday (2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis). These tumors were not increased in another mouse study in females dosed at 10 or 3020 mgkgday (2 to 5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis) in this study, there was a high incidence of early mortalities in males of the 3020 mgkgday group. The incidence of mammary gland adenomas and adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female mice dosed at 2 mgkgday and in female rats dosed at 4 mgkgday (0.5 and 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine elevated serum prolactin levels up to 4fold in rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in mammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin mediated. The relevance for human risk of the finding of prolactin mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) . Mutagenesis  No evidence of genotoxic potential for olanzapine was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes, induction of forward mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells, or in vivo sister chromatid exchange test in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters. Impairment of Fertility  In an oral fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, male mating performance, but not fertility, was impaired at a dose of 22.4 mgkgday and female fertility was decreased at a dose of 3 mgkgday (11 and 1.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis, respectively). Discontinuance of olanzapine treatment reversed the effects on male mating performance. In female rats, the precoital period was increased and the mating index reduced at 5 mgkgday (2.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis). Diestrous was prolonged and estrous delayed at 1.1 mgkgday (0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis) therefore olanzapine may produce a delay in ovulation. In animal studies with olanzapine, the principal hematologic findings were reversible peripheral cytopenias in individual dogs dosed at 10 mgkg (17 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis), doserelated decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils in mice, and lymphopenia in rats. A few dogs treated with 10 mgkg developed reversible neutropenia andor reversible hemolytic anemia between 1 and 10 months of treatment. Doserelated decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils were seen in mice given doses of 10 mgkg (equal to 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis) in studies of 3 months duration. Nonspecific lymphopenia, consistent with decreased body weight gain, occurred in rats receiving 22.5 mgkg (11 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis) for 3 months or 16 mgkg (8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm 2 basis) for 6 or 12 months. No evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found in any of the species examined. Bone marrows were normocellular or hypercellular, indicating that the reductions in circulating blood cells were probably due to peripheral (nonmarrow) factors.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>Boxed Warning Section Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.14) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2). When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Boxed Warning section of the package insert for Symbyax.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>Overdosage Section In premarketing trials involving more than 3100 patients andor normal subjects, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of olanzapine was identified in 67 patients. In the patient taking the largest identified amount, 300 mg, the only symptoms reported were drowsiness and slurred speech. In the limited number of patients who were evaluated in hospitals, including the patient taking 300 mg, there were no observations indicating an adverse change in laboratory analytes or ECG. Vital signs were usually within normal limits following overdoses. In postmarketing reports of overdose with olanzapine alone, symptoms have been reported in the majority of cases. In symptomatic patients, symptoms with 10 incidence included agitationaggressiveness, dysarthria, tachycardia, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma. Among less commonly reported symptoms were the following potentially medically serious reactions aspiration, cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiac arrhythmias (such as supraventricular tachycardia and 1 patient experiencing sinus pause with spontaneous resumption of normal rhythm), delirium, possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depressionarrest, convulsion, hypertension, and hypotension. Eli Lilly and Company has received reports of fatality in association with overdose of olanzapine alone. In 1 case of death, the amount of acutely ingested olanzapine was reported to be possibly as low as 450 mg of oral olanzapine however, in another case, a patient was reported to survive an acute olanzapine ingestion of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, which may include intubation. Gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the C max and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose. The possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. There is no specific antidote to olanzapine. Therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be initiated. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids andor sympathomimetic agents. (Do not use epinephrine, dopamine, or other sympathomimetics with betaagonist activity, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of olanzapineinduced alpha blockade.) Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. For specific information about overdosage with lithium or valproate, refer to the Overdosage section of the package inserts for these products. For specific information about overdosage with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, refer to the Overdosage section of the Symbyax package insert.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>Warnings And Precautions Section When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert for Symbyax. Increased Mortality  Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.14), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2). In placebocontrolled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapinetreated patients was significantly greater than placebotreated patients (3.5 vs 1.5, respectively). Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke  Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis. In placebocontrolled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) . The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and in bipolar I disorder, and close supervision of highrisk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for olanzapine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) . Physicians should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100 to 126 mgdL, nonfasting 140 to 200 mgdL). Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients starting treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.4 ). Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatmentemergent hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics. Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15 mgdL. In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mgdL. Placebotreated subjects (N19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mgdL. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  In an analysis of 5 placebocontrolled adult olanzapine monotherapy studies with a median treatment duration of approximately 3 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76 mgdL versus 0.17 mgdL). The difference in mean changes between olanzapine and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with antidiabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level 200 mgdL, andor a baseline fasting glucose level 126 mgdL). Olanzapinetreated patients had a greater mean HbA1c increase from baseline of 0.04 (median exposure 21 days), compared to a mean HbA1c decrease of 0.06 in placebotreated subjects (median exposure 17 days). In an analysis of 8 placebocontrolled studies (median treatment exposure 4 to 5 weeks), 6.1 of olanzapinetreated subjects (N855) had treatmentemergent glycosuria compared to 2.8 of placebotreated subjects (N599). Table 2 shows shortterm and longterm changes in fasting glucose levels from adult olanzapine monotherapy studies. Table 2 Changes in Fasting Glucose Levels from Adult Olanzapine Monotherapy Studies Up to 12 weeks exposure At least 48 weeks exposure Laboratory Analyte Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N Patients N Patients Fasting Glucose Normal to High (100 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 543 2.2 345 12.8 Placebo 293 3.4 NA NA Borderline to High (100 mgdL and 126 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 178 17.4 127 26 Placebo 96 11.5 NA NA Not Applicable. The mean change in fasting glucose for patients exposed at least 48 weeks was 4.2 mgdL (N487). In analyses of patients who completed 9 to 12 months of olanzapine therapy, mean change in fasting and nonfasting glucose levels continued to increase over time. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents  The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescent patients, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change from baseline in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.68 mgdL versus 2.59 mgdL). The mean change in fasting glucose for adolescents exposed at least 24 weeks was 3.1 mgdL (N121). Table 3 shows shortterm and longterm changes in fasting blood glucose from adolescent olanzapine monotherapy studies. Table 3 Changes in Fasting Glucose Levels from Adolescent Olanzapine Monotherapy Studies Up to 12 weeks exposure At least 24 weeks exposure Laboratory Analyte Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N Patients N Patients Fasting Glucose Normal to High (100 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 124 0 108 0.9 Placebo 53 1.9 NA NA Borderline to High (100 mgdL and 126 mgdL to 126 mgdL) Olanzapine 14 14.3 13 23.1 Placebo 13 0 NA NA Not Applicable. Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed with olanzapine use. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic followup lipid evaluations in patients using olanzapine, is recommended see Patient Counseling Information (17.5) . Clinically significant, and sometimes very high (500 mgdL), elevations in triglyceride levels have been observed with olanzapine use. Modest mean increases in total cholesterol have also been seen with olanzapine use. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  In an analysis of 5 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapinetreated patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.3 mgdL, 3 mgdL, and 20.8 mgdL respectively compared to decreases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 6.1 mgdL, 4.3 mgdL, and 10.7 mgdL for placebotreated patients. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapinetreated patients and placebotreated patients. Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline, where lipid dysregulation was defined as patients diagnosed with dyslipidemia or related adverse reactions, patients treated with lipid lowering agents, or patients with high baseline lipid levels. In longterm studies (at least 48 weeks), patients had increases fro m baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.6 mgdL, 2.5 mgdL, and 18.7 mgdL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 0.16 mgdL. In an analysis of patients who completed 12 months of therapy, the mean nonfasting total cholesterol did not increase further after approximately 4 to 6 months. The proportion of patients who had changes (at least once) in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides from normal or borderline to high, or changes in HDL cholesterol from normal or borderline to low, was greater in longterm studies (at least 48 weeks) as compared with shortterm studies.

In phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), over a median exposure of 9.2 months, the mean increase in triglycerides in patients taking olanzapine was 40.5 mgdL. In phase 1 of CATIE, the mean increase in total cholesterol was 9.4 mgdL. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents  The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescents, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapinetreated adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 12.9 mgdL, 6.5 mgdL, and 28.4 mgdL, respectively, compared to increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol of 1.3 mgdL and 1 mgdL, and a decrease in triglycerides of 1.1 mgdL for placebotreated adolescents. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapinetreated adolescents and placebotreated adolescents. In longterm studies (at least 24 weeks), adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.5 mgdL, 5.4 mgdL, and 20.5 mgdL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 4.5 mgdL.

Potential consequences of weight gain should be considered prior to starting olanzapine. Patients receiving olanzapine should receive regular monitoring of weight see Patient Counseling Information (17.6) . Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  In an analysis of 13 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies, olanzapinetreated patients gained an average of 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) compared to an average 0.3 kg (0.6 lb) weight loss in placebotreated patients with a median exposure of 6 weeks 22.2 of olanzapinetreated patients gained at least 7 of their baseline weight, compared to 3 of placebotreated patients, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks 4.2 of olanzapinetreated patients gained at least 15 of their baseline weight, compared to 0.3 of placebotreated patients, with a median exposure to event of 12 weeks. Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.2 of olanzapinetreated patients and in 0 of placebotreated patients. In longterm studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) (median exposure of 573 days, N2021). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7, 15, or 25 of their baseline body weight with longterm exposure were 64, 32, and 12, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4 of olanzapinetreated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure. Table 6 includes data on adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified.

Mean increase in weight in adolescents was greater than in adults. In 4 placebocontrolled trials, discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 1 of olanzapinetreated patients, compared to 0 of placebotreated patients. Table 7 Weight Gain with Olanzapine Use in Adolescents from 4 PlaceboControlled Trials Olanzapinetreated patients Placebotreated patients Mean change in body weight from baseline (median exposure  3 weeks) 4.6 kg (10.1 lb) 0.3 kg (0.7 lb) Percentage of patients who gained at least 7 of baseline body weight 40.6 (median exposure to 7  4 weeks) 9.8 (median exposure to 7  8 weeks) Percentage of patients who gained at least 15 of baseline body weight 7.1 (median exposure to 15  19 weeks) 2.7 (median exposure to 15  8 weeks) In longterm studies (at least 24 weeks), the mean weight gain was 11.2 kg (24.6 lb) (median exposure of 201 days, N179). The percentages of adolescents who gained at least 7, 15, or 25 of their baseline body weight with longterm exposure were 89, 55, and 29, respectively. Among adolescent patients, mean weight gain by baseline BMI category was 11.5 kg (25.3 lb), 12.1 kg (26.6 lb), and 12.7 kg (27.9 lb), respectively, for normal (N106), <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> (N26) and obese (N17). Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.2 of olanzapinetreated patients following at least 24 weeks of exposure. Table 8 shows data on adolescent weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 6 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified. Little clinical trial data is available on weight gain in adolescents with olanzapine beyond 6 months of treatment.

Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, olanzapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with olanzapine despite the presence of the syndrome. For specific information about the warnings of lithium or valproate, refer to the Warnings section of the package inserts for these other products. Olanzapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its  1 adrenergic antagonistic properties see Patient Counseling Information (17.7) . For oral olanzapine therapy, the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by initiating therapy with 5 mg QD see Dosage and Administration (2) . A more gradual titration to the target dose should be considered if hypotension occurs. Syncope was reported in 0.6 (152500) of olanzapinetreated patients in phase 2 to 3 oral olanzapine studies. The risk for this sequence of hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus pause may be greater in nonpsychiatric patients compared to psychiatric patients who are possibly more adapted to certain effects of psychotropic drugs. Olanzapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) where the occurrence of syncope, or hypotension andor bradycardia might put the patient at increased medical risk. Caution is necessary in patients who receive treatment with other drugs having effects that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression see Drug Interactions (7) . Class Effect  In clinical trial andor postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including olanzapine. Agranulocytosis has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of olanzapine should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm 3 ) should discontinue olanzapine and have their WBC followed until recovery. Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimers disease. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimers disease. During premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0.9 (222500) of olanzapinetreated patients. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimers dementia. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimers disease. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction associated with olanzapine treatment, occurring at an incidence of 26 in olanzapine patients compared to 15 in placebo patients. This adverse reaction was also dose related. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.4 (92500) of patients in the premarketing database. Since olanzapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that olanzapine therapy does not affect them adversely see Patient Counseling Information (17.8) . Disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing olanzapine for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration see Patient Counseling Information (17.9) . Clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Olanzapine exhibits in vitro muscarinic receptor affinity. In premarketing clinical trials with olanzapine, olanzapine was associated with constipation, dry mouth, and tachycardia, all adverse reactions possibly related to cholinergic antagonism. Such adverse reactions were not often the basis for discontinuations from olanzapine, but olanzapine should be used with caution in patients with clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, narrow angle glaucoma, or a history of paralytic ileus or related conditions. In 5 placebocontrolled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis (n1184), the following treatmentemergent adverse reactions were reported in olanzapinetreated patients at an incidence of at least 2 and significantly greater than placebotreated patients falls, somnolence, peripheral edema, abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, lethargy, increased weight, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, dry mouth and visual hallucinations. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was greater with olanzapine than placebo (13 vs 7). Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) . Olanzapine has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Because of the risk of orthostatic hypotension with olanzapine, caution should be observed in cardiac patients see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) . As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, olanzapine elevates prolactin levels, and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactinelevating compounds. Longstanding hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) . Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. In placebo controlled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 30 of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5 of adults treated with placebo. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 8136 adults treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrualrelated events 1 (2 493240 of females), sexual functionrelated events 2 (2 1508136 of females and males), and breastrelated events 3 (0.7 233240 of females, 0.2 94896 of males). In placebo controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescent patients (up to 6 weeks) with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 47 of olanzapinetreated patients compared to 7 of placebotreated patients. In a pooled analysis from clinical trials including 454 adolescents treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrualrelated events 1 (1 2168 of females), sexual functionrelated events 2 (0.7 3454 of females and males), and breastrelated events 3 (2 3168 of females, 2 7286 of males) see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . 1 Based on a search of the following terms amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, menstruation delayed, and oligomenorrhea. 2 Based on a search of the following terms anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, loss of libido, abnormal orgasm, and sexual dysfunction. 3 Based on a search of the following terms breast discharge, enlargement or swelling, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and lactation disorder. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, the prescriber should also refer to the Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert for Symbyax. When using olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, the prescriber should refer to the Warnings and Precautions sections of the package inserts for lithium or valproate see Drug Interactions (7) . Fasting blood glucose testing and lipid profile at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment is recommended see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5) and Patient Counseling Information (17.4, 17.5) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugdrug interactions can be pharmacodynamic (combined pharmacologic effects) or pharmacokinetic (alteration of plasma levels). The risks of using ziprasidone in combination with other drugs have been evaluated as described below. All interactions studies have been conducted with oral ziprasidone. Based upon the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of ziprasidone, possible interactions could be anticipated Approximately twothirds of ziprasidone is metabolized via a combination of chemical reduction by glutathione and enzymatic reduction by aldehyde oxidase. There are no known clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of aldehyde oxidase. Less than onethird of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is mediated by cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidation. An in vitro enzyme inhibition study utilizing human liver microsomes showed that ziprasidone had little inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and thus would not likely interfere with the metabolism of drugs primarily metabolized by these enzymes. There is little potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Ziprasidone should not be used with any drug that prolongs the QT interval see Contraindications (4.1). Given the primary CNS effects of ziprasidone, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, ziprasidone may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Ziprasidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is an inducer of CYP3A4 administration of 200 mg twice daily for 21 days resulted in a decrease of approximately 35 in the AUC of ziprasidone. This effect may be greater when higher doses of carbamazepine are administered. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, at a dose of 400 mg QD for 5 days, increased the AUC and Cmax of ziprasidone by about 3540. Other inhibitors of CYP3A4 would be expected to have similar effects. Cimetidine Cimetidine at a dose of 800 mg QD for 2 days did not affect ziprasidone pharmacokinetics. Antacid The coadministration of 30 mL of Maalox with ziprasidone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Ziprasidone at a dose of 40 mg twice daily administered concomitantly with lithium at a dose of 450 mg twice daily for 7 days did not affect the steadystate level or renal clearance of lithium. Ziprasidone dosed adjunctively to lithium in a maintenance trial of bipolar patients did not affect mean therapeutic lithium levels. In vivo studies have revealed no effect of ziprasidone on the pharmacokinetics of estrogen or progesterone components. Ziprasidone at a dose of 20 mg twice daily did not affect the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered oral contraceptives, ethinyl estradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg). Consistent with in vitro results, a study in normal healthy volunteers showed that ziprasidone did not alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 model substrate, to its major metabolite, dextrorphan. There was no statistically significant change in the urinary dextromethorphandextrorphan ratio. A pharmacokinetic interaction of ziprasidone with valproate is unlikely due to the lack of common metabolic pathways for the two drugs. Ziprasidone dosed adjunctively to valproate in a maintenance trial of bipolar patients did not affect mean therapeutic valproate levels. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of schizophrenic patients enrolled in controlled clinical trials has not revealed evidence of any clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with benztropine, propranolol, or lorazepam. The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose under fed conditions is approximately 60. The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to twofold in the presence of food see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS  USAGE GEODON is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar manic or mixed episodes, and as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. GEODON intramuscular is indicated for acute agitation in schizophrenic patients. When deciding among the alternative treatments available for the condition needing treatment, the prescriber should consider the finding of ziprasidones greater capacity to prolong the QTQTc interval compared to several other antipsychotic drugs see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) . Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated in some other drugs with the ability to cause torsade de pointestype arrhythmia, a potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs should be tried first. Whether ziprasidone will cause torsade de pointes or increase the rate of sudden death is not yet known see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  Geodon is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. The efficacy of oral ziprasidone was established in four shortterm (4 and 6week) controlled trials of adult schizophrenic inpatients and in one maintenance trial of stable adult schizophrenic inpatients see Clinical Studies (14.1) . Geodon is indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Efficacy was established in two 3week monotherapy studies in adult patients see Clinical Studies (14.2) . Geodon is indicated as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. Efficacy was established in a maintenance trial in adult patients. The efficacy of Geodon as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.2) . GEODON intramuscular is indicated for the treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenic patients for whom treatment with ziprasidone is appropriate and who need intramuscular antipsychotic medication for rapid control of agitation. The efficacy of intramuscular ziprasidone for acute agitation in schizophrenia was established in single day controlled trials of agitated schizophrenic inpatients see Clinical Trials (14.1)  "Psychomotor agitation" is defined in DSMIV as "excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension". Schizophrenic patients experiencing agitation often manifest behaviors that interfere with their diagnosis and care, e.g., threatening behaviors, escalating or urgently distressing behavior, or selfexhausting behavior, leading clinicians to the use of intramuscular antipsychotic medications to achieve immediate control of the agitation. Since there is no experience regarding the safety of administering ziprasidone intramuscular to schizophrenic patients already taking oral ziprasidone, the practice of coadministration is not recommended. Ziprasidone intramuscular is intended for intramuscular use only and should not be administered intravenously.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>spl_patient_package_insert</i>:</td><td>"SPL PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT PATIENT SUMMARY OF INFORMATION ABOUT GEODON Capsules (ziprasidone HCl) Information for patients taking GEODON or their caregivers This summary contains important information about GEODON. It is not meant to take the place of your doctors instructions. Read this information carefully before you take GEODON. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand any of this information or if you want to know more about GEODON. What Is GEODON? GEODON is a type of prescription medicine called a psychotropic, also known as an atypical antipsychotic. GEODON can be used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. GEODON can also be used as maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder when added to lithium or valproate. Who Should Take GEODON? Only your doctor can know if GEODON is right for you. GEODON may be prescribed for you if you have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Symptoms of schizophrenia may include hearing voices, seeing things, or sensing things that are not there (hallucinations) beliefs that are not true (delusions) unusual suspiciousness (paranoia) becoming withdrawn from family and friends Symptoms of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder may include extremely high or irritable mood increased energy, activity, and restlessness racing thoughts or talking very fast easily distracted little need for sleep If you show a response to GEODON, your symptoms may improve. If you continue to take GEODON there is less chance of your symptoms returning. Do not stop taking the capsules even when you feel better without first discussing it with your doctor. It is also important to remember that GEODON capsules should be taken with food. What is the most important safety information I should know about GEODON? GEODON is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis. Elderly patients with a diagnosis of psychosis related to dementia treated with antipsychotics are at an increased risk of death when compared to patients who are treated with placebo (a sugar pill). GEODON is an effective drug to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and the manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. However, one potential side effect is that it may change the way the electrical current in your heart works more than some other drugs. The change is small and it is not known whether this will be harmful, but some other drugs that cause this kind of change have in rare cases caused dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities. Because of this, GEODON should be used only after your doctor has considered this risk for GEODON against the risks and benefits of other medications available for treating schizophrenia or bipolar manic and mixed episodes. Your risk of dangerous changes in heart rhythm can be increased if you are taking certain other medicines and if you already have certain abnormal heart conditions. Therefore, it is important to tell your doctor about any other medicines that you take, including nonprescription medicines, supplements, and herbal medicines. You must also tell your doctor about any heart problems you have or have had. Who should NOT take GEODON? Elderly patients with a diagnosis of psychosis related to dementia. GEODON is not approved for the treatment of these patients. Anything that can increase the chance of a heart rhythm abnormality should be avoided. Therefore, do not take GEODON if You have certain heart diseases, for example, long QT syndrome, a recent heart attack, severe heart failure, or certain irregularities of heart rhythm (discuss the specifics with your doctor) You are currently taking medications that should not be taken in combination with ziprasidone, for example, dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, other Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, droperidol, pimozide, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine, arsenic trioxide, levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus. What To Tell Your Doctor Before You Start GEODON Only your doctor can decide if GEODON is right for you. Before you start GEODON, be sure to tell your doctor if you have had any problem with the way your heart beats or any heart related illness or disease any family history of heart disease, including recent heart attack have had any problem with fainting or dizziness are taking or have recently taken any prescription medicines are taking any overthecounter medicines you can buy without a prescription, including naturalherbal remedies have had any problems with your liver are pregnant, might be pregnant, or plan to get pregnant are breast feeding are allergic to any medicines have ever had an allergic reaction to ziprasidone or any of the other ingredients of GEODON capsules. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these ingredients have low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood Your doctor may want you to get additional laboratory tests to see if GEODON is an appropriate treatment for you. GEODON And Other Medicines There are some medications that may be unsafe to use when taking GEODON, and there are some medicines that can affect how well GEODON works. While you are on GEODON, check with your doctor before starting any new prescription or overthecounter medications, including naturalherbal remedies. How To Take GEODON Take GEODON only as directed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole. Take GEODON capsules with food. It is best to take GEODON at the same time each day. GEODON may take a few weeks to work. It is important to be patient. Do not change your dose or stop taking your medicine without your doctors approval. Remember to keep taking your capsules, even when you feel better. Possible Side Effects Because these problems could mean youre having a heart rhythm abnormality, contact your doctor IMMEDIATELY if you Faint or lose consciousness Feel a change in the way that your heart beats (palpitations) Common side effects of GEODON include the following and should also be discussed with your doctor if they occur Feeling unusually tired or sleepy Nausea or upset stomach Constipation Dizziness Restlessness Abnormal muscle movements, including tremor, shuffling, and uncontrolled involuntary movements Diarrhea Rash Increased cough  runny nose If you develop any side effects that concern you, talk with your doctor. It is particularly important to tell your doctor if you have diarrhea, vomiting, or another illness that can cause you to lose fluids. Your doctor may want to check your blood to make sure that you have the right amount of important salts after such illnesses. For a list of all side effects that have been reported, ask your doctor or pharmacist for the GEODON Professional Package Insert. What To Do For An Overdose In case of an overdose, call your doctor or poison control center right away or go to the nearest emergency room. Other Important Safety Information A serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) can occur with all antipsychotic medications including GEODON. Signs of NMS include very high fever, rigid muscles, shaking, confusion, sweating, or increased heart rate and blood pressure. NMS is a rare but serious side effect that could be fatal. Therefore, tell your doctor if you experience any of these signs. Delayedonset drug reaction called drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can occur with ziprasidone. Signs of DRESS may include rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. DRESS is sometimes fatal therefore, tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these signs. Adverse reactions related to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), sometimes serious, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with GEODON, and it is not known if GEODON is associated with these reactions. Patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia. Dizziness caused by a drop in your blood pressure may occur with GEODON, especially when you first start taking this medication or when the dose is increased. If this happens, be careful not to stand up too quickly, and talk to your doctor about the problem. Before taking GEODON, tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant. It is advised that you dont breast feed an infant if you are taking GEODON. Because GEODON can cause sleepiness, be careful when operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Since medications of the same drug class as GEODON may interfere with the ability of the body to adjust to heat, it is best to avoid situations involving high temperature or humidity. It is best to avoid consuming alcoholic beverages while taking GEODON. Call your doctor immediately if you take more than the amount of GEODON prescribed by your doctor. GEODON has not been shown to be safe or effective in the treatment of children and teenagers under the age of 18 years old. Keep GEODON and all medicines out of the reach of children. How To Store GEODON Store GEODON capsules at room temperature (59F to 86F or 15C to 30C). For More Information About GEODON This sheet is only a summary.

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Ziprasidone has not been systematically studied, in animals or humans, for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which ziprasidone will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of ziprasidone misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS Commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence 5 and at least twice the incidence for placebo) were Schizophrenia Somnolence, respiratory tract infection. (6.1) Manic and Mixed Episodes Associated with Bipolar Disorder Somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, dizziness, akathisia, abnormal vision, asthenia, vomiting. (6.1) Intramuscular administration (5 and at least twice the lowest intramuscular ziprasidone group) Headache, nausea, somnolence. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc at 18004381985 or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical trials for oral ziprasidone included approximately 5700 patients andor normal subjects exposed to one or more doses of ziprasidone. Of these 5700, over 4800 were patients who participated in multipledose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 1831 patientyears. These patients include (1) 4331 patients who participated in multipledose trials, predominantly in schizophrenia, representing approximately 1698 patientyears of exposure as of February 5, 2000 and (2) 472 patients who participated in bipolar mania trials representing approximately 133 patientyears of exposure. An additional 127 patients with bipolar disorder participated in a longterm maintenance treatment study representing approximately 74.7 patientyears of exposure to ziprasidone. The conditions and duration of treatment with ziprasidone included openlabel and doubleblind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and shortterm and longerterm exposure. Clinical trials for intramuscular ziprasidone included 570 patients andor normal subjects who received one or more injections of ziprasidone. Over 325 of these subjects participated in trials involving the administration of multiple doses. Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by collecting voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials with Oral Ziprasidone The following findings are based on the shortterm placebocontrolled premarketing trials for schizophrenia (a pool of two 6week, and two 4week fixeddose trials) and bipolar mania (a pool of two 3week flexibledose trials) in which ziprasidone was administered in doses ranging from 10 to 200 mgday. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short TermPlaceboControlled Trials The following adverse reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of ziprasidone (incidence of 5 or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebotreated patients (ziprasidone incidence at least twice that for placebo) Schizophrenia trials (see Table 11) Somnolence Respiratory Tract Infection Bipolar trials (see Table 12) Somnolence Extrapyramidal Symptoms which includes the following adverse reaction terms extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, dystonia, dyskinesia, hypokinesia, tremor, paralysis and twitching. None of these adverse reactions occurred individually at an incidence greater than 10 in bipolar mania trials. Dizziness which includes the adverse reaction terms dizziness and lightheadedness. Akathisia Abnormal Vision Asthenia Vomiting SCHIZOPHRENIA Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials of Oral Ziprasidone Approximately 4.1 (29702) of ziprasidonetreated patients in shortterm, placebocontrolled studies discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with about 2.2 (6273) on placebo. The most common reaction associated with dropout was rash, including 7 dropouts for rash among ziprasidone patients (1) compared to no placebo patients see Warnings and Precautions (5.7). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2 or More Among ZiprasidoneTreated Patients in ShortTerm, Oral, PlaceboControlled Trials Table 11 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks) in predominantly patients with schizophrenia, including only those reactions that occurred in 2 or more of patients treated with ziprasidone and for which the incidence in patients treated with ziprasidone was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients.

Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)  The incidence of reported EPS (which included the adverse reaction terms extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, dystonia, dyskinesia, hypokinesia, tremor, paralysis and twitching) for ziprasidonetreated patients in the shortterm, placebocontrolled schizophrenia trials was 14 vs. 8 for placebo. Objectively collected data from those trials on the SimpsonAngus Rating Scale (for EPS) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia) did not generally show a difference between ziprasidone and placebo. Dystonia  Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Vital Sign Changes  Ziprasidone is associated with orthostatic hypotension see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)  ECG Changes  Ziprasidone is associated with an increase in the QTc interval see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). In the schizophrenia trials, ziprasidone was associated with a mean increase in heart rate of 1.4 beats per minute compared to a 0.2 beats per minute decrease among placebo patients. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Oral Ziprasidone Following is a list of COSTART terms that reflect treatmentemergent adverse reactions as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section reported by patients treated with ziprasidone in schizophrenia trials at multiple doses 4 mgday within the database of 3834 patients. All reported reactions are included except those already listed in Table 11 or elsewhere in labeling, those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative, reactions reported only once and that did not have a substantial probability of being acutely lifethreatening, reactions that are part of the illness being treated or are otherwise common as background reactions, and reactions considered unlikely to be drugrelated. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with ziprasidone, they were not necessarily caused by it. Adverse reactions are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions Frequent  adverse reactions occurring in at least 1100 patients (1.0 of patients) (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebocontrolled trials appear in this listing) Infrequent  adverse reactions occurring in 1100 to 11000 patients (in 0.11.0 of patients) Rare  adverse reactions occurring in fewer than 11000 patients (0.1 of patients).

The most common reactions associated with dropout in the ziprasidonetreated patients were akathisia, anxiety, depression, dizziness, dystonia, rash and vomiting, with 2 dropouts for each of these reactions among ziprasidone patients (1) compared to one placebo patient each for dystonia and rash (1) and no placebo patients for the remaining adverse reactions. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2 or More Among ZiprasidoneTreated Patients in ShortTerm, Oral, PlaceboControlled Trials Table 12 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 3 weeks) in patients with bipolar mania, including only those reactions that occurred in 2 or more of patients treated with ziprasidone and for which the incidence in patients treated with ziprasidone was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients.

Explorations for interactions on the basis of gender did not reveal any clinically meaningful differences in the adverse reaction occurrence on the basis of this demographic factor. INTRAMUSCULAR ZIPRASIDONE Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 1 or More Among ZiprasidoneTreated Patients in ShortTerm Trials of Intramuscular Ziprasidone Table 13 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy with intramuscular ziprasidone in 1 or more of patients. In these studies, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of intramuscular ziprasidone (incidence of 5 or greater) and observed at a rate on intramuscular ziprasidone (in the higher dose groups) at least twice that of the lowest intramuscular ziprasidone group were headache (13), nausea (12), and somnolence (20).

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Give oral doses with food. Schizophrenia Initiate at 20 mg twice daily. Daily dosage may be adjusted up to 80 mg twice daily. Dose adjustments should occur at intervals of not less than 2 days. Safety and efficacy has been demonstrated in doses up to 100 mg twice daily. The lowest effective dose should be used. (2.1) Acute treatment of manicmixed episodes of bipolar I disorder Initiate at 40 mg twice daily. Increase to 60 mg or 80 mg twice daily on day 2 of treatment. Subsequent dose adjustments should be based on tolerability and efficacy within the range of 4080 mg twice daily. (2.2) Maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as an adjunct to lithium or valproate Continue treatment at the same dose on which the patient was initially stabilized, within the range of 4080 mg twice daily. (2.2) Acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia (intramuscular administration) 10 mg20 mg up to a maximum dose of 40 mg per day. Doses of 10 mg may be administered every 2 hours. Doses of 20 mg may be administered every 4 hours. (2.3) Dose Selection GEODON Capsules should be administered at an initial daily dose of 20 mg twice daily with food. In some patients, daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status up to 80 mg twice daily. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 2 days, as steadystate is achieved within 1 to 3 days. In order to ensure use of the lowest effective dose, patients should ordinarily be observed for improvement for several weeks before upward dosage adjustment. Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 20 mg to 100 mg twice daily in shortterm, placebocontrolled clinical trials. There were trends toward dose response within the range of 20 mg to 80 mg twice daily, but results were not consistent. An increase to a dose greater than 80 mg twice daily is not generally recommended. The safety of doses above 100 mg twice daily has not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14.1) . Maintenance Treatment While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient treated with ziprasidone should remain on it, a maintenance study in patients who had been symptomatically stable and then randomized to continue ziprasidone or switch to placebo demonstrated a delay in time to relapse for patients receiving Geodon see Clinical Studies (14.1) . No additional benefit was demonstrated for doses above 20 mg twice daily. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Acute Treatment of Manic or Mixed Episodes Dose SelectionOral ziprasidone should be administered at an initial daily dose of 40 mg twice daily with food. The dose may then be increased to 60 mg or 80 mg twice daily on the second day of treatment and subsequently adjusted on the basis of tolerance and efficacy within the range 40 mg80 mg twice daily. In the flexibledose clinical trials, the mean daily dose administered was approximately 120 mg see Clinical Studies (14.2) . Maintenance Treatment (as an adjunct to lithium or valproate) Continue treatment at the same dose on which the patient was initially stabilized, within the range of 40 mg80 mg twice daily with food. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment see Clinical Studies (14.2) . Intramuscular Dosing The recommended dose is 10 mg to 20 mg administered as required up to a maximum dose of 40 mg per day. Doses of 10 mg may be administered every two hours doses of 20 mg may be administered every four hours up to a maximum of 40 mgday. Intramuscular administration of ziprasidone for more than three consecutive days has not been studied. If longterm therapy is indicated, oral ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules should replace the intramuscular administration as soon as possible. Since there is no experience regarding the safety of administering ziprasidone intramuscular to schizophrenic patients already taking oral ziprasidone, the practice of coadministration is not recommended. Ziprasidone intramuscular is intended for intramuscular use only and should not be administered intravenously. Intramuscular Preparation for Administration GEODON for Injection (ziprasidone mesylate) should only be administered by intramuscular injection and should not be administered intravenously. Singledose vials require reconstitution prior to administration. Add 1.2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection to the vial and shake vigorously until all the drug is dissolved. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 20 mg ziprasidone. To administer a 10 mg dose, draw up 0.5 mL of the reconstituted solution. To administer a 20 mg dose, draw up 1.0 mL of the reconstituted solution. Any unused portion should be discarded. Since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in this product, aseptic technique must be used in preparation of the final solution. This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products or solvents other than Sterile Water for Injection. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Oral Dosage adjustments are generally not required on the basis of age, gender, race, or renal or hepatic impairment. Geodon is not approved for use in children or adolescents. Intramuscular Ziprasidone intramuscular has not been systematically evaluated in elderly patients or in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. As the cyclodextrin excipient is cleared by renal filtration, ziprasidone intramuscular should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal function.

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of ziprasidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drugs efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. As with other drugs having efficacy in bipolar disorder, the mechanism of action of ziprasidone in bipolar disorder is unknown. Ziprasidone exhibited high in vitro binding affinity for the dopamine D2 and D3, the serotonin 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT1A, 5HT1D, and 1adrenergic receptors (Ki s of 4.8, 7.2, 0.4, 1.3, 3.4, 2, and 10 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the histamine H1 receptor (Ki47 nM). Ziprasidone functioned as an antagonist at the D2, 5HT2A, and 5HT1D receptors, and as an agonist at the 5HT1A receptor. Ziprasidone inhibited synaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. No appreciable affinity was exhibited for other receptorbinding sites tested, including the cholinergic muscarinic receptor (IC50 1 M). Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of ziprasidone. Ziprasidones antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Ziprasidones antagonism of 1adrenergic receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. Oral Pharmacokinetics Ziprasidones activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multipledose pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone are doseproportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and ziprasidone accumulation is predictable with multiple dosing. Elimination of ziprasidone is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal halflife of about 7 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steadystate concentrations are achieved within one to three days of dosing. The mean apparent systemic clearance is 7.5 mLminkg. Ziprasidone is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Absorption Ziprasidone is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 6 to 8 hours. The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose under fed conditions is approximately 60. The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to twofold in the presence of food. Distribution Ziprasidone has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 1.5 Lkg. It is greater than 99 bound to plasma proteins, binding primarily to albumin and 1acid glycoprotein. The in vitro plasma protein binding of ziprasidone was not altered by warfarin or propranolol, two highly proteinbound drugs, nor did ziprasidone alter the binding of these drugs in human plasma. Thus, the potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement is minimal. Metabolism and Elimination Ziprasidone is extensively metabolized after oral administration with only a small amount excreted in the urine (1) or feces (4) as unchanged drug. Ziprasidone is primarily cleared via three metabolic routes to yield four major circulating metabolites, benzisothiazole (BITP) sulphoxide, BITPsulphone, ziprasidone sulphoxide, and Smethyldihydroziprasidone. Approximately 20 of the dose is excreted in the urine, with approximately 66 being eliminated in the feces. Unchanged ziprasidone represents about 44 of total drugrelated material in serum. In vitro studies using human liver subcellular fractions indicate that Smethyldihydroziprasidone is generated in two steps. These studies indicate that the reduction reaction is mediated primarily by chemical reduction by glutathione as well as by enzymatic reduction by aldehyde oxidase and the subsequent methylation is mediated by thiol methyltransferase. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes indicate that CYP3A4 is the major CYP contributing to the oxidative metabolism of ziprasidone. CYP1A2 may contribute to a much lesser extent. Based on in vivo abundance of excretory metabolites, less than onethird of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is mediated by cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidation and approximately twothirds via reduction. There are no known clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of aldehyde oxidase. Intramuscular Pharmacokinetics Systemic Bioavailability The bioavailability of ziprasidone administered intramuscularly is 100. After intramuscular administration of single doses, peak serum concentrations typically occur at approximately 60 minutes postdose or earlier and the mean halflife (T) ranges from two to five hours. Exposure increases in a doserelated manner and following three days of intramuscular dosing, little accumulation is observed. Metabolism and Elimination Although the metabolism and elimination of IM ziprasidone have not been systematically evaluated, the intramuscular route of administration would not be expected to alter the metabolic pathways."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of oral ziprasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in 5 placebocontrolled studies, 4 shortterm (4 and 6week) trials and one maintenance trial. All trials were in adult inpatients, most of whom met DSM IIIR criteria for schizophrenia. Each study included 2 to 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone as well as placebo. Four of the 5 trials were able to distinguish ziprasidone from placebo one shortterm study did not. Although a single fixeddose haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in one of the three shortterm trials, this single study was inadequate to provide a reliable and valid comparison of ziprasidone and haloperidol. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) are both multiitem inventories of general psychopathology usually used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second widely used assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, the Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS) was employed for assessing negative symptoms in one trial. The results of the oral ziprasidone trials in schizophrenia follow In a 4week, placebocontrolled trial (n139) comparing 2 fixed doses of ziprasidone (20 and 60 mg twice daily) with placebo, only the 60 mg dose was superior to placebo on the BPRS total score and the CGI severity score. This higher dose group was not superior to placebo on the BPRS psychosis cluster or on the SANS. In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n302) comparing 2 fixed doses of ziprasidone (40 and 80 mg twice daily) with placebo, both dose groups were superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, the CGI severity score and the PANSS total and negative subscale scores. Although 80 mg twice daily had a numerically greater effect than 40 mg twice daily, the difference was not statistically significant. In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n419) comparing 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone (20, 60, and 100 mg twice daily) with placebo, all three dose groups were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score, the BPRS total score, the BPRS psychosis cluster, and the CGI severity score. Only the 100 mg twice daily dose group was superior to placebo on the PANSS negative subscale score. There was no clear evidence for a doseresponse relationship within the 20 mg twice daily to 100 mg twice daily dose range. In a 4week, placebocontrolled trial (n200) comparing 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone (5, 20, and 40 mg twice daily), none of the dose groups was statistically superior to placebo on any outcome of interest. A study was conducted in stable chronic or subchronic (CGIS 5 at baseline) schizophrenic inpatients (n294) who had been hospitalized for not less than two months. After a 3day singleblind placebo runin, subjects were randomized to one of 3 fixed doses of ziprasidone (20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg twice daily) or placebo and observed for relapse. Patients were observed for "impending psychotic relapse," defined as CGIimprovement score of 6 (much worse or very much worse) andor scores 6 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS on two consecutive days. Ziprasidone was significantly superior to placebo in time to relapse, with no significant difference between the different dose groups. There were insufficient data to examine population subsets based on age and race. Examination of population subsets based on gender did not reveal any differential responsiveness. Acute Manic and Mixed Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder The efficacy of ziprasidone was established in 2 placebocontrolled, doubleblind, 3week monotherapy studies in patients meeting DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic features. Primary rating instruments used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials were (1) the Mania Rating Scale (MRS), which is derived from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and SchizophreniaChange Version (SADSCB) with items grouped as the Manic Syndrome subscale (elevated mood, less need for sleep, excessive energy, excessive activity, grandiosity), the Behavior and Ideation subscale (irritability, motor hyperactivity, accelerated speech, racing thoughts, poor judgment) and impaired insight and (2) the Clinical Global ImpressionSeverity of Illness Scale (CGIS), which was used to assess the clinical significance of treatment response. The results of the oral ziprasidone trials in adult bipolar I disorder, manicmixed episode follow in a 3week placebocontrolled trial (n210), the dose of ziprasidone was 40 mg twice daily on Day 1 and 80 mg twice daily on Day 2. Titration within the range of 4080 mg twice daily (in 20 mg twice daily increments) was permitted for the duration of the study. Ziprasidone was significantly more effective than placebo in reduction of the MRS total score and the CGIS score. The mean daily dose of ziprasidone in this study was 132 mg. In a second 3week placebocontrolled trial (n205), the dose of ziprasidone was 40 mg twice daily on Day 1. Titration within the range of 4080 mg twice daily (in 20 mg twice daily increments) was permitted for the duration of study (beginning on Day 2). Ziprasidone was significantly more effective than placebo in reduction of the MRS total score and the CGIS score. The mean daily dose of ziprasidone in this study was 112 mg. Maintenance Therapy The efficacy of ziprasidone as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in a placebocontrolled trial in patients who met DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder. The trial included patients whose most recent episode was manic or mixed, with or without psychotic features. In the openlabel phase, patients were required to be stabilized on ziprasidone plus lithium or valproic acid for at least 8 weeks in order to be randomized. In the doubleblind randomized phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or valproic acid and were randomized to receive either ziprasidone (administered twice daily totaling 80 mg to 160 mg per day) or placebo. Generally, in the maintenance phase, patients continued on the same dose on which they were stabilized during the stabilization phase. The primary endpoint in this study was time to recurrence of a mood episode (manic, mixed or depressed episode) requiring intervention, which was defined as any of the following discontinuation due to a mood episode, clinical intervention for a mood episode (e.g., initiation of medication or hospitalization), or Mania Rating Scale score  18 or a MADRS score 18 (on 2 consecutive assessments no more than 10 days apart). A total of 584 subjects were treated in the openlabel stabilization period. In the doubleblind randomization period, 127 subjects were treated with ziprasidone, and 112 subjects were treated with placebo. Ziprasidone was superior to placebo in increasing the time to recurrence of a mood episode. The types of relapse events observed included depressive, manic, and mixed episodes. Depressive, manic, and mixed episodes accounted for 53, 34, and 13, respectively, of the total number of relapse events in the study. The efficacy of intramuscular ziprasidone in the management of agitated schizophrenic patients was established in two shortterm, doubleblind trials of schizophrenic subjects who were considered by the investigators to be "acutely agitated" and in need of IM antipsychotic medication. In addition, patients were required to have a score of 3 or more on at least 3 of the following items of the PANSS anxiety, tension, hostility and excitement. Efficacy was evaluated by analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) of the Behavioural Activity Rating Scale (BARS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity rating. The BARS is a seven point scale with scores ranging from 1 (difficult or unable to rouse) to 7 (violent, requires restraint). Patients scores on the BARS at baseline were mostly 5 (signs of overt activity physical or verbal, calms down with instructions) and as determined by investigators, exhibited a degree of agitation that warranted intramuscular therapy. There were few patients with a rating higher than 5 on the BARS, as the most severely agitated patients were generally unable to provide informed consent for participation in premarketing clinical trials. Both studies compared higher doses of ziprasidone intramuscular with a 2 mg control dose. In one study, the higher dose was 20 mg, which could be given up to 4 times in the 24 hours of the study, at interdose intervals of no less than 4 hours. In the other study, the higher dose was 10 mg, which could be given up to 4 times in the 24 hours of the study, at interdose intervals of no less than 2 hours. The results of the intramuscular ziprasidone trials follow (1)In a oneday, doubleblind, randomized trial (n79) involving doses of ziprasidone intramuscular of 20 mg or 2 mg, up to QID, ziprasidone intramuscular 20 mg was statistically superior to ziprasidone intramuscular 2 mg, as assessed by AUC of the BARS at 0 to 4 hours, and by CGI severity at 4 hours and study endpoint.(2)In another oneday, doubleblind, randomized trial (n117) involving doses of ziprasidone intramuscular of 10 mg or 2 mg, up to QID, ziprasidone intramuscular 10 mg was statistically superior to ziprasidone intramuscular 2 mg, as assessed by AUC of the BARS at 0 to 2 hours, but not by CGI severity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. (8.1) Nursing Mothers Breast feeding is not recommended. (8.3) Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness for pediatric patients has not been established. (8.4) Renal Impairment Intramuscular ziprasidone should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal function as the cyclodextrin excipient is cleared by renal filtration. (8.10) Pregnancy Category C In animal studies ziprasidone demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects at doses similar to human therapeutic doses. When ziprasidone was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, an increased incidence of fetal structural abnormalities (ventricular septal defects and other cardiovascular malformations and kidney alterations) was observed at a dose of 30 mgkgday (3 times the MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis). There was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 10 mgkgday (equivalent to the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). In rats, embryofetal toxicity (decreased fetal weights, delayed skeletal ossification) was observed following administration of 10 to 160 mgkgday (0.5 to 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) during organogenesis or throughout gestation, but there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Doses of 40 and 160 mgkgday (2 and 8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) were associated with maternal toxicity. The developmental noeffect dose was 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). There was an increase in the number of pups born dead and a decrease in postnatal survival through the first 4 days of lactation among the offspring of female rats treated during gestation and lactation with doses of 10 mgkgday (0.5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. Offspring developmental delays and neurobehavioral functional impairment were observed at doses of 5 mgkgday (0.2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) or greater. A noeffect level was not established for these effects. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Ziprasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Geodon should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The effect of ziprasidone on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. It is not known whether ziprasidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. It is recommended that women receiving ziprasidone should not breastfeed. The safety and effectiveness of ziprasidone in pediatric patients have not been established. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ziprasidone, 2.4 percent were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the presence of multiple factors that might increase the pharmacodynamic response to ziprasidone, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period for some elderly patients. Ziprasidone intramuscular has not been systematically evaluated in elderly patients (65 years and over). Because ziprasidone is highly metabolized, with less than 1 of the drug excreted unchanged, renal impairment alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. The pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone following 8 days of 20 mg twice daily dosing were similar among subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (n27), and subjects with normal renal function, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. Ziprasidone is not removed by hemodialysis. Intramuscular ziprasidone has not been systematically evaluated in elderly patients or in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. As the cyclodextrin excipient is cleared by renal filtration, ziprasidone intramuscular should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal function see Clinical Pharmacology (12). As ziprasidone is cleared substantially by the liver, the presence of hepatic impairment would be expected to increase the AUC of ziprasidone a multipledose study at 20 mg twice daily for 5 days in subjects (n13) with clinically significant (ChildsPugh Class A and B) cirrhosis revealed an increase in AUC 012 of 13 and 34 in ChildsPugh Class A and B, respectively, compared to a matched control group (n14). A halflife of 7.1 hours was observed in subjects with cirrhosis compared to 4.8 hours in the control group. In a multipledose (8 days of treatment) study involving 32 subjects, there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone between men and women or between elderly (65 years) and young (18 to 45 years) subjects. Additionally, population pharmacokinetic evaluation of patients in controlled trials has revealed no evidence of clinically significant age or genderrelated differences in the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Dosage modifications for age or gender are, therefore, not recommended. Based on in vitro studies utilizing human liver enzymes, ziprasidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2 smoking should therefore not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Consistent with these in vitro results, population pharmacokinetic evaluation has not revealed any significant pharmacokinetic differences between smokers and nonsmokers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Carcinogenesis Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted with ziprasidone in Long Evans rats and CD1 mice. Ziprasidone was administered for 24 months in the diet at doses of 2, 6, or 12 mgkgday to rats, and 50, 100, or 200 mgkgday to mice (0.1 to 0.6 and 1 to 5 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis, respectively). In the rat study, there was no evidence of an increased incidence of tumors compared to controls. In male mice, there was no increase in incidence of tumors relative to controls. In female mice, there were doserelated increases in the incidences of pituitary gland adenoma and carcinoma, and mammary gland adenocarcinoma at all doses tested (50 to 200 mgkgday or 1 to 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). Proliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary glands of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered to be prolactinmediated. Increases in serum prolactin were observed in a 1month dietary study in female, but not male, mice at 100 and 200 mgkgday (or 2.5 and 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). Ziprasidone had no effect on serum prolactin in rats in a 5week dietary study at the doses that were used in the carcinogenicity study. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactinmediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown see Warnings and Precautions (5.12). Mutagenesis Ziprasidone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation mouse lymphoma assay, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes, and the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in mouse bone marrow. There was a reproducible mutagenic response in the Ames assay in one strain of S. typhimurium in the absence of metabolic activation. Positive results were obtained in both the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation assay and the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Impairment of Fertility Ziprasidone was shown to increase time to copulation in SpragueDawley rats in two fertility and early embryonic development studies at doses of 10 to 160 mgkgday (0.5 to 8 times the MRHD of 200 mgday on a mgm2 basis). Fertility rate was reduced at 160 mgkgday (8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). There was no effect on fertility at 40 mgkgday (2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis). The effect on fertility appeared to be in the female since fertility was not impaired when males given 160 mgkgday (8 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) were mated with untreated females. In a 6month study in male rats given 200 mgkgday (10 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) there were no treatmentrelated findings observed in the testes.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>BOXED WARNING Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. GEODON (ziprasidone) is not approved for the treatment of patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE In premarketing trials involving more than 5400 patients andor normal subjects, accidental or intentional overdosage of oral ziprasidone was documented in 10 patients. All of these patients survived without sequelae. In the patient taking the largest confirmed amount, 3,240 mg, the only symptoms reported were minimal sedation, slurring of speech, and transitory hypertension (20095). Adverse reactions reported with ziprasidone overdose included extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, tremor, and anxiety. see Adverse Reactions (6.2) In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Intravenous access should be established, and gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QTprolonging effects that might be additive to those of ziprasidone. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids. If sympathomimetic agents are used for vascular support, epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation combined with 1 antagonism associated with ziprasidone may worsen hypotension. Similarly, it is reasonable to expect that the alphaadrenergicblocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of ziprasidone, resulting in problematic hypotension. In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. There is no specific antidote to ziprasidone, and it is not dialyzable. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT Interval Prolongation GEODON use should be avoided in patients with bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, congenital prolongation of the QT interval, or in combination with other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation. (5.2) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Potentially fatal symptom complex has been reported with antipsychotic drugs. Manage with immediate discontinuation of drug and close monitoring. (5.3) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with Ziprasidone exposure. DRESS is sometimes fatal. Discontinue Geodon if DRESS is suspected.(5.4) Tardive Dyskinesia May develop acutely or chronically. (5.5) Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. (5.6) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Monitor all patients for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients with DM risk factors should undergo blood glucose testing before and during treatment. (5.6) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. (5.6) Weight Gain Weight gain has been reported. Monitor weight gain. (5.6) Rash Discontinue in patients who develop a rash without an identified cause. (5.7) Orthostatic Hypotension Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. (5.8) Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis has been reported with antipsychotics. Patients with a preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) or a history of leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue Geodon at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. (5.9) Seizures Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower seizure threshold. (5.10) Potential for Cognitive and Motor impairment Patients should use caution when operating machinery. (5.13) Suicide Closely supervise highrisk patients. (5.16) Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. GEODON is not approved for the treatment of dementiarelated psychosis. see Boxed Warning Ziprasidone use should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval see Contraindications (4.1), Drug Interactions (7.4). Additionally, clinicians should be alert to the identification of other drugs that have been consistently observed to prolong the QTc interval. Such drugs should not be prescribed with ziprasidone. Ziprasidone should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias see Contraindications (4). A study directly comparing the QTQTc prolonging effect of oral ziprasidone with several other drugs effective in the treatment of schizophrenia was conducted in patient volunteers. In the first phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration when the drug was administered alone. In the second phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration while the drug was coadministered with an inhibitor of the CYP4503A4 metabolism of the drug. In the first phase of the study, the mean change in QTc from baseline was calculated for each drug, using a samplebased correction that removes the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for ziprasidone ranged from approximately 9 to 14 msec greater than for four of the comparator drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol), but was approximately 14 msec less than the prolongation observed for thioridazine. In the second phase of the study, the effect of ziprasidone on QTc length was not augmented by the presence of a metabolic inhibitor (ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily). In placebocontrolled trials, oral ziprasidone increased the QTc interval compared to placebo by approximately 10 msec at the highest recommended daily dose of 160 mg. In clinical trials with oral ziprasidone, the electrocardiograms of 22988 (0.06) patients who received GEODON and 1440 (0.23) patients who received placebo revealed QTc intervals exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. In the ziprasidonetreated patients, neither case suggested a role of ziprasidone. One patient had a history of prolonged QTc and a screening measurement of 489 msec QTc was 503 msec during ziprasidone treatment. The other patient had a QTc of 391 msec at the end of treatment with ziprasidone and upon switching to thioridazine experienced QTc measurements of 518 and 593 msec. Some drugs that prolong the QTQTc interval have been associated with the occurrence of torsade de pointes and with sudden unexplained death. The relationship of QT prolongation to torsade de pointes is clearest for larger increases (20 msec and greater) but it is possible that smaller QTQTc prolongations may also increase risk, or increase it in susceptible individuals. Although torsade de pointes has not been observed in association with the use of ziprasidone in premarketing studies and experience is too limited to rule out an increased risk, there have been rare postmarketing reports (in the presence of multiple confounding factors) see Adverse Reactions (6.2). A study evaluating the QTQTc prolonging effect of intramuscular ziprasidone, with intramuscular haloperidol as a control, was conducted in patient volunteers. In the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration following two injections of ziprasidone (20 mg then 30 mg) or haloperidol (7.5 mg then 10 mg) given four hours apart. Note that a 30 mg dose of intramuscular ziprasidone is 50 higher than the recommended therapeutic dose. The mean change in QTc from baseline was calculated for each drug, using a samplebased correction that removes the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for ziprasidone was 4.6 msec following the first injection and 12.8 msec following the second injection. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for haloperidol was 6.0 msec following the first injection and 14.7 msec following the second injection. In this study, no patients had a QTc interval exceeding 500 msec. As with other antipsychotic drugs and placebo, sudden unexplained deaths have been reported in patients taking ziprasidone at recommended doses. The premarketing experience for ziprasidone did not reveal an excess risk of mortality for ziprasidone compared to other antipsychotic drugs or placebo, but the extent of exposure was limited, especially for the drugs used as active controls and placebo. Nevertheless, ziprasidones larger prolongation of QTc length compared to several other antipsychotic drugs raises the possibility that the risk of sudden death may be greater for ziprasidone than for other available drugs for treating schizophrenia. This possibility needs to be considered in deciding among alternative drug products see Indications and Usage (1). Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes andor sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. It is recommended that patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment who are at risk for significant electrolyte disturbances, hypokalemia in particular, have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Hypokalemia (andor hypomagnesemia) may increase the risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmia. Hypokalemia may result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Patients with low serum potassium andor magnesium should be repleted with those electrolytes before proceeding with treatment. It is essential to periodically monitor serum electrolytes in patients for whom diuretic therapy is introduced during ziprasidone treatment. Persistently prolonged QTc intervals may also increase the risk of further prolongation and arrhythmia, but it is not clear that routine screening ECG measures are effective in detecting such patients. Rather, ziprasidone should be avoided in patients with histories of significant cardiovascular illness, e.g., QT prolongation, recent acute myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia. Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements 500 msec. For patients taking ziprasidone who experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes, e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope, the prescriber should initiate further evaluation, e.g., Holter monitoring may be useful. A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with Ziprasidone exposure. DRESS consists of a combination of three or more of the following cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, lymphadenopathy and one or more systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. DRESS is sometimes fatal. Discontinue ziprasidone if DRESS is suspected. A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients undergoing treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, ziprasidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ziprasidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ziprasidone despite the presence of the syndrome. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascularcerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with GEODON. Although fewer patients have been treated with GEODON, it is not known if this more limited experience is the sole reason for the paucity of such reports. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions is not completely understood. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. Pooled data from shortterm, placebocontrolled studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are presented in Tables 14. Note that for the flexible dose studies in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, each subject is categorized as having received either low (2040 mg BID) or high (6080 mg BID) dose based on the subjects modal daily dose. In the tables showing categorical changes, the percentages ( column) are calculated as 100(nN).

Schizophrenia  The proportions of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of  7 of body weight were compared in a pool of four 4 and 6week placebocontrolled schizophrenia clinical trials, revealing a statistically significantly greater incidence of weight gain for ziprasidone (10) compared to placebo (4). A median weight gain of 0.5 kg was observed in ziprasidone patients compared to no median weight change in placebo patients. In this set of clinical trials, weight gain was reported as an adverse reaction in 0.4 and 0.4 of ziprasidone and placebo patients, respectively. During longterm therapy with ziprasidone, a categorization of patients at baseline on the basis of body mass index (BMI) revealed the greatest mean weight gain and highest incidence of clinically significant weight gain ( 7 of body weight) in patients with low BMI (23) compared to normal (2327) or <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> patients (27). There was a mean weight gain of 1.4 kg for those patients with a "low" baseline BMI, no mean change for patients with a "normal" BMI, and a 1.3 kg mean weight loss for patients who entered the program with a "high" BMI. Bipolar Disorder  During a 6month placebocontrolled bipolar maintenance study in adults with ziprasidone as an adjunct to lithium or valproate, the incidence of clinically significant weight gain ( 7 of body weight) during the doubleblind period was 5.6 for both ziprasidone and placebo treatment groups who completed the 6 months of observation for relapse. Interpretation of these findings should take into consideration that only patients who adequately tolerated ziprasidone entered the doubleblind phase of the study, and there were substantial dropouts during the open label phase. In premarketing trials with ziprasidone, about 5 of patients developed rash andor urticaria, with discontinuation of treatment in about onesixth of these cases. The occurrence of rash was related to dose of ziprasidone, although the finding might also be explained by the longer exposure time in the higher dose patients. Several patients with rash had signs and symptoms of associated systemic illness, e.g., elevated WBCs. Most patients improved promptly with adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids andor upon discontinuation of ziprasidone, and all patients experiencing these reactions were reported to recover completely. Upon appearance of rash for which an alternative etiology cannot be identified, ziprasidone should be discontinued. Ziprasidone may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its 1adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 0.6 of the patients treated with ziprasidone. Ziprasidone should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue Geodon at the first sign of decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm3) should discontinue Geodon and have their WBC followed until recovery. During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.4 of patients treated with ziprasidone. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. As with other antipsychotic drugs, ziprasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimers dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimers dementia. Ziprasidone and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia see Boxed Warning. As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, ziprasidone elevates prolactin levels in humans. Increased prolactin levels were also observed in animal studies with this compound, and were associated with an increase in mammary gland neoplasia in mice a similar effect was not observed in rats see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1). Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactindependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactinelevating compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Longstanding hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density. Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction in patients treated with ziprasidone. In the 4 and 6week placebocontrolled trials, somnolence was reported in 14 of patients on ziprasidone compared to 7 of placebo patients. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.3 of patients in shortterm clinical trials. Since ziprasidone has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that ziprasidone therapy does not affect them adversely. One case of priapism was reported in the premarketing database. While the relationship of the reaction to ziprasidone use has not been established, other drugs with alphaadrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism, and it is possible that ziprasidone may share this capacity. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention. Although not reported with ziprasidone in premarketing trials, disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ziprasidone for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration. The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illness or bipolar disorder, and close supervision of highrisk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for ziprasidone should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Clinical experience with ziprasidone in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited see Use in Specific Populations (8.6),( 8.7). Ziprasidone has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Because of the risk of QTc prolongation and orthostatic hypotension with ziprasidone, caution should be observed in cardiac patients. see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), (5.8). Patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment that are at risk of significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Low serum potassium and magnesium should be replaced before proceeding with treatment. Patients who are started on diuretics during Ziprasidone therapy need periodic monitoring of serum potassium and magnesium. Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements 500 msec see Warnings and Precautions (5.2).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>Pharmacokinetics The skin metabolizes estradiol only to a small extent. In contrast, orally administered estradiol is rapidly metabolized by the liver to estrone and its conjugates, giving rise to higher circulating levels of estrone than estradiol. Therefore, transdermal administration produces therapeutic plasma levels of estradiol with lower circulating levels of estrone and estrone conjugates and requires smaller total doses than does oral therapy. Absorption In a multipledose study consisting of three consecutive system applications of the original formulation Vivelle (estradiol transdermal system) which was conducted in 17 healthy, postmenopausal women, blood levels of estradiol and estrone were compared following application of these units to sites on the abdomen and buttocks in a crossover fashion. Systems that deliver nominal estradiol doses of approximately 0.0375 mgday and 0.1 mgday were applied to abdominal application sites while the 0.1 mgday doses were also applied to sites on the buttocks. These systems increased estradiol levels above baseline within 4 hours and maintained respective mean levels of 25 and 79 pgmL above baseline following application to the abdomen slightly higher mean levels of 88 pgmL above baseline were observed following application to the buttocks. At the same time, increases in estrone plasma concentrations averaged about 12 and 50 pgmL, respectively, following application to the abdomen and 61 pgmL for the buttocks. While plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone remained slightly above baseline at 12 hours following removal of the systems in this study, results from another study show these levels to return to baseline values within 24 hours following removal of the systems. Figure 1 illustrates the mean plasma concentrations of estradiol at steadystate during application of these patches at four different dosages. Figure 1SteadyState Estradiol Plasma Concentrations for Systems Applied to the AbdomenNonbaselinecorrected levels The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in the table below. Table 1 SteadyState Estradiol Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Systems Applied to the Abdomen (mean  standard deviation) Nonbaselinecorrected data Dosage (mgday) Cmax (pgmL) Cavg (pgmL) Cmin (84 hr) (pgmL) 0.0375 46  16 34  10 30 10 0.05 83  41 57  23 41  11 0.075 99  35 72  24 60  24 0.1 133  51 89  38 90  44 0.1 145  71 104  52 85  47 Mean baseline estradiol concentration  11.7 pgmL Peak plasma concentration Average plasma concentration Minimum plasma concentration at 84 hr Measured over 80 hr Applied to the buttocks VivelleDot (estradiol transdermal system), the revised formulation with smaller system sizes, was shown to be bioequivalent to the original formulation, Vivelle (estradiol transdermal system), used in the clinical trials. Distribution No specific investigation of the tissue distribution of estradiol absorbed from VivelleDot in humans has been conducted. The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormonebinding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the gut followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. Excretion Estradiol, estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The halflife values calculated after dosing with the VivelleDot ranged from 5.9 to 7.7 hours. After removal of the transdermal systems, serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone returned to baseline levels within 24 hours. Special Populations VivelleDot was only investigated in postmenopausal women. Drug Interactions In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. Johns Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects andor changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects. Adhesion Based on combined data from three shortterm clinical trials consisting of 471 observations, 85 of VivelleDot adhered completely to the skin over the 3.5day wear period. Three (3) of the systems detached and were reapplied or replaced during the 3.5day wear period. Approximately 80 of the transdermal systems evaluated in these studies were VivelleDot 0.05 mgday.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS A. General 1. Addition of a p rogestin w hen a w oman h as n ot h ad a h ysterectomy . Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogenalone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Elevated B lood P ressure . In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use. 3. Hypertriglyceridemia. In patients with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications. 4. Impaired L iver F unction and p ast h istory of c holestatic j aundice. Although transdermally administered estrogen therapy avoids firstpass hepatic metabolism, estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 5. Hypothyroidism. Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroidbinding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 6. Fluid R etention. Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. 7. Hypocalcemia. Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia. 8. Ovarian C ancer. The CEMPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average followup of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CEMPA vs placebo was 1.58 (95 confidence interval 0.77  3.24) but was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CEMPA vs placebo was 4.2 vs 2.7 cases per 10,000 womenyears. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen alone, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations. 9. Exacerbation of E ndometriosis. Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated posthysterectomy with estrogen alone therapy. For patients known to have residual endometriosis posthysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. 10. Exacerbation of O ther C onditions. Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraines or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information. Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe VivelleDot (estradiol transdermal system). C. Laboratory Tests. Estrogen administration should be initiated at the lowest dose approved for the indication and then guided by clinical response, rather than by serum hormone levels (e.g., estradiol, FSH). D. DrugLaboratory Test Interactions. Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time increased platelet count increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VIIX complex, IIVIIX complex and betathromboglobulin decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III decreased antithrombin III activity increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroidbinding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels, as measured by proteinbound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Patients on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum (i.e., corticosteroidbinding globulin CBG, sex hormonebinding globulin SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogenrenin substrate, alpha1antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma HDL and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced LDL cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. Reduced response to metyrapone test. E. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. Longterm, continuous administration of estrogen, with and without progestin, in women with and without a uterus, has shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. (See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS.) Longterm, continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver. F. Pregnancy. VivelleDot should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS.) G. Nursing Mothers. Estrogen administration to nursing mothers has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving this drug. Caution should be exercised when VivelleDot is administered to a nursing woman. H. Pediatric Use. Estrogen therapy has been used for the induction of puberty in adolescents with some forms of pubertal delay. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not otherwise been established. Large and repeated doses of estrogen over an extended time period have been shown to accelerate epiphyseal closure, which could result in short adult stature if treatment is initiated before the completion of physiologic puberty in normally developing children. If estrogen is administered to patients whose bone growth is not complete, periodic monitoring of bone maturation and effects on epiphyseal centers is recommended during estrogen administration. Estrogen treatment of prepubertal girls also induces premature breast development and vaginal cornification, and may induce vaginal bleeding. (See INDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) I. Geriatric Use. The safety and effectiveness in geriatric patients have not been established. In the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study, including 4,532 women 65 years of age and older, followed for an average of 4 years, 82 (n  3,729) were 65 to 74 while 18 (n  803) were 75 and over. Most women (80) had no prior hormone therapy use. Women treated with conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate were reported to have a twofold increase in the risk of developing probable dementia. Alzheimers disease was the most common classification of probable dementia in both the conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate group and the placebo group. Ninety percent of the cases of probable dementia occurred in the 54 of women that were older than 70. (See WARNINGS, Dementia.) It is unknown whether these findings apply to estrogen alone therapy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE VivelleDot (estradiol transdermal system) is indicated in Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause. Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause. When prescribing solely for the treatment of symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, topical vaginal products should be considered. Treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure. Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should only be considered for women at significant risk of osteoporosis and nonestrogen medications should be carefully considered. The mainstays for decreasing the risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis are weightbearing exercise, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, and when indicated, pharmacologic therapy. Postmenopausal women require an average of 1500 mgday of elemental calcium. Therefore, when not contraindicated, calcium supplementation may be helpful for women with suboptimal dietary intake. Vitamin D supplementation of 400800 IUday may also be required to ensure adequate daily intake in postmenopausal women.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>spl_patient_package_insert</i>:</td><td>PATIENT INFORMATION VivelleDot  (estradiol transdermal system) Read this PATIENT INFORMATION before you start using VivelleDot (estradiol transdermal system) and read all the information that you get each time you refill VivelleDot. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. The VivelleDot (estradiol transdermal system) patch that your healthcare provider has prescribed for you releases small amounts of an estrogen hormone through the skin. This leaflet describes the risks and benefits of treatment with VivelleDot. VivelleDot is not for everyone. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about this medication. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT VIVELLE DOT (AN ESTROGEN HORMONE)? Estrogens increase the chances of getting cancer of the uterus. Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away while you are taking estrogens. Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause. Do not use estrogens with or without progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, or strokes. Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your chances of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens may increase your risk of dementia. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with VivelleDot. What is Vivelle Dot? VivelleDot is a patch that contains the estrogen hormone, estradiol. When applied to the skin as directed below, VivelleDot releases estrogen through the skin into the bloodstream. What is Vivelle Dot used for? VivelleDot is used after menopause to  reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones made by a womans ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the change of life or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes surgical menopause. When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating (hot flashes or hot flushes). In some women, the symptoms are mild and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with VivelleDot.  treat moderate to severe dryness, itching and burning in or around the vagina. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with VivelleDot to control these problems. If you use VivelleDot only to treat your dryness, itching, and burning in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you.  treat certain conditions in which a young womans ovaries do not produce enough estrogens naturally.  help reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis (thin weak bones). Osteoporosis from menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break. If you use VivelleDot only to prevent osteoporosis from menopause, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you should continue with VivelleDot. Weightbearing exercise, like walking or running, and taking calcium and vitamin D supplements may also lower your chances of getting postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is important to talk about exercise and supplements with your healthcare provider before starting them. Who should not take Vivelle Dot? Do not start taking VivelleDot if you  have unusual vaginal bleeding.  currently have or have had certain cancers. Estrogens may increase the chances of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should take VivelleDot.  had a stroke or heart attack in the recent past (for example in the past year).  currently have or have had blood clots.  currently have or have had liver problems.  are allergic to Vivelle Dot or any of its ingredients.

The hormone in VivelleDot can pass into your milk.  about all of your medical problems. Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), migraine, endometriosis, lupus, or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium levels in your blood.  about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how VivelleDot works. VivelleDot may also affect how other medicines work.  if you are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest. You may need to stop taking estrogens. How should I take Vivelle Dot? Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. Estrogens should be used at the lowest dose possible for your treatment, only as long as needed. The lowest effective dose of VivelleDot has not been determined for any indication. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with VivelleDot. Application Instructions for VivelleDot (estradiol transdermal system) 1. Determine Your Schedule for Your TwiceaWeek Application Decide upon which two days you will change your patch. Your VivelleDot (estradiol transdermal system) individual carton contains a calendar card printed on its inner flap. Mark the twoday schedule you plan to follow on your cartons inner flap. BE CONSISTENT. If you forget to change your patch on the correct date, apply a new one as soon as you remember. No matter what day this happens, stick to the schedule you have marked on the inner flap of your carton (your calendar card). 2. Where to Apply VivelleDot  Apply patch to lower abdomen, below the waistline. Avoid the waistline, since clothing may cause the patch to rub off. DO NOT APPLY PATCH TO BREASTS. When changing your patch, based on your twiceaweek schedule, apply your new patch to a different site. Do not apply a new patch to that same area for at least one week. 3. Before You Apply VivelleDot  Make sure your skin is Clean (freshly washed), dry and cool. Free of any powder, oil, moisturizer or lotion. Free of cuts andor irritations (rashes or other skin problems). 4. How to Apply VivelleDot  Each patch is individually sealed in a protective pouch. Tear open the pouch at the tear notch (do not use scissors). Remove the patch. Apply the patch immediately after removing from pouch. Holding the patch with the rigid protective liner facing you, remove half of the liner, which covers the sticky surface of the patch. AVOID TOUCHING THE STICKY SIDE OF THE PATCH WITH YOUR FINGERS. Using the other half of the rigid protective liner as a handle, apply the sticky side of the patch to the selected area of the abdomen. Press the sticky side of the patch firmly into place. Smooth it down. While still holding the sticky side down, fold back the other half of the patch. Grasp an edge of the remaining protective liner and gently pull it off. AVOID TOUCHING THE STICKY SIDE OF THE PATCH WITH YOUR FINGERS. Press the entire patch firmly into place with the palm of your hand. Continue to apply pressure, with the palm of your hand over the patch, for approximately 10 seconds. Make sure that the patch is properly adhered to your skin. Go over the edges with your finger to ensure good contact around the patch. PLEASE NOTE  Contact with water while bathing, swimming or showering will not affect the patch.  In the event that a patch should fall off, AVOID TOUCHING THE STICKY SIDE WITH YOUR FINGERS. Put the same patch back on a different site, making sure to press the patch firmly into place for at least 10 seconds.  Continue to follow your original twiceaweek schedule you have marked on the inner flap of your individual carton (your calendar card).  If necessary, if the same patch cannot be reapplied, apply a new patch at another location but continue to follow your original schedule. 5. How to Change and Discard Vivelle Dot   When changing the patch, peel off the used patch slowly.  Fold the used patch in half (sticky sides together) and discard appropriately, in the trash.  PLEASE KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.  If any adhesive residue remains on your skin after removing the patch, allow the area to dry for 15 minutes. Then, gently rub the area with oil or lotion to remove the adhesive from your skin.  Keep in mind, the new patch must be applied to a different area of your abdomen. This area must be clean, dry, cool and free of powder, oil or lotion. What are the possible side effects of estrogens? Less common but serious side effects include  Breast cancer  Cancer of the uterus  Stroke  Heart attack  Blood clots  Dementia  Gallbladder disease  Ovarian cancer These are some of the warning signs of serious side effects  Breast lumps  Unusual vaginal bleeding  Dizziness and faintness  Changes in speech  Severe headaches  Chest pain  Shortness of breath  Pains in your legs  Changes in vision  Vomiting Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of these warning signs, or any other unusual symptom that concerns you. Common side effects include  Headache  Breast pain  Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting  Stomachabdominal cramps, bloating  Nausea and vomiting  Hair loss Other side effects include  High blood pressure  Liver problems  High blood sugar  Fluid retention  Enlargement of benign tumors of the uterus (fibroids)  Vaginal yeast infection Other side effects of VivelleDot may be possible. If you have questions, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist. What can I do to lower my chances of a serious side effect with Vivelle Dot?  Talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue taking VivelleDot.  If you have a uterus, talk to your healthcare provider about whether the addition of a progestin is right for you.  See your healthcare provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking VivelleDot.  Have a breast exam and mammogram (breast Xray) every year unless your healthcare provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often.  If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are <b style='color:red'>overweight</b>, or if you use tobacco, you may have higher chances of getting heart disease. Ask your healthcare provider for ways to lower your chances of getting heart disease. General information about safe and effective use of Vivelle Dot Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not take VivelleDot for conditions for which it was not prescribed. Do not give VivelleDot to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them. Keep Vivelle Dot out of the reach of children. This leaflet provides a summary of the most important information about VivelleDot. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider or pharmacist. You can ask for information about VivelleDot that is written for health professionals. You can get more information by calling the tollfree number (888NOWNOVA) (8886696682). What are the ingredients in Vivelle Dot? VivelleDot is comprised of three layers.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The adhesive side of VivelleDot (estradiol transdermal system) should be placed on a clean, dry area of the abdomen. Vivelle Dot should not be applied to the breasts. VivelleDot should be replaced twice weekly. The sites of application must be rotated, with an interval of at least 1 week allowed between applications to a particular site. The area selected should not be oily, damaged, or irritated. The waistline should be avoided, since tight clothing may rub the system off. The system should be applied immediately after opening the pouch and removing the protective liner. The system should be pressed firmly in place with the palm of the hand for about 10 seconds, making sure there is good contact, especially around the edges. In the event that a system should fall off, the same system may be reapplied. If the same system cannot be reapplied, a new system should be applied to another location. In either case, the original treatment schedule should be continued. If a woman has forgotten to apply a patch, she should apply a new patch as soon as possible. The new patch should be applied on the original treatment schedule. The interruption of treatment in women taking VivelleDot might increase the likelihood of breakthrough bleeding, spotting and recurrence of symptoms. Initiation of Therapy When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3month to 6month intervals) to determine whether treatment is still necessary (see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of VivelleDot has not been determined for any indication. For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, start therapy with VivelleDot 0.0375 mgday applied to the skin twice weekly. For the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, start therapy with VivelleDot 0.025 mgday applied to the skin twice weekly. The dosage may be adjusted as necessary. Reproductive systemassociated adverse events were encountered more frequently in the highest dose group (0.1 mgday) than in other active treatment groups or in placebotreated patients. In women not currently taking oral estrogens or in women switching from another estradiol transdermal therapy, treatment with VivelleDot may be initiated at once. In women who are currently taking oral estrogens, treatment with VivelleDot should be initiated 1 week after withdrawal of oral hormone therapy, or sooner if menopausal symptoms reappear in less than 1 week. Therapeutic Regimen VivelleDot may be given continuously in patients who do not have an intact uterus. In those patients with an intact uterus, VivelleDot may be given on a cyclic schedule (e.g., three weeks on drug followed by one week off drug).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>A. General 1. Addition of a p rogestin w hen a w oman h as n ot h ad a h ysterectomy . Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogenalone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Elevated B lood P ressure . In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use. 3. Hypertriglyceridemia. In patients with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications. 4. Impaired L iver F unction and p ast h istory of c holestatic j aundice. Although transdermally administered estrogen therapy avoids firstpass hepatic metabolism, estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 5. Hypothyroidism. Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroidbinding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 6. Fluid R etention. Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. 7. Hypocalcemia. Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia. 8. Ovarian C ancer. The CEMPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average followup of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CEMPA vs placebo was 1.58 (95 confidence interval 0.77  3.24) but was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CEMPA vs placebo was 4.2 vs 2.7 cases per 10,000 womenyears. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen alone, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations. 9. Exacerbation of E ndometriosis. Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated posthysterectomy with estrogen alone therapy. For patients known to have residual endometriosis posthysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. 10. Exacerbation of O ther C onditions. Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraines or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS. The use of unopposed estrogens in women who have a uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. 1. Cardiovascular Disorders Estrogen and estrogenprogestin therapy has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (venous thromboembolism or VTE). Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) andor venous thromboembolism (e.g., personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke In the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) study, an increase in the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes has been observed in women receiving CE compared to placebo. These observations are preliminary. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). In the CEMPA substudy of WHI an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death) was observed in women receiving CEMPA compared to women receiving placebo (37 vs 30 per 10,000 womenyears). The increase in risk was observed in year one and persisted. In the same substudy of WHI, an increased risk of stroke was observed in women receiving CEMPA compared to women receiving placebo (29 vs 21 per 10,000 womenyears). The increase in risk was observed after the first year and persisted. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n  2,763, average age 66.7 years), a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and EstrogenProgestin Replacement Study HERS) treatment with CEMPA0.625 mg 2.5 mg per day demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average followup of 4.1 years, treatment with CEMPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CEMPAtreated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twentyone women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average followup in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CEMPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis. b. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) In the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) study, an increase in VTE has been observed in women receiving CE compared to placebo. These observations are preliminary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). In the CEMPA substudy of WHI, a 2fold greater rate of VTE, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, was observed in women receiving CEMPA compared to women receiving placebo. The rate of VTE was 34 per 10,000 womenyears in the CEMPA group compared to 16 per 10,000 womenyears in the placebo group. The increase in VTE risk was observed during the first year and persisted. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Endometrial Cancer The use of unopposed estrogens in women with intact uteri has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12fold greater than in nonusers and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use with increased risks of 15 to 24fold for five to ten years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogenprogestin combinations is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. b. Breast Cancer The use of estrogens and progestins by postmenopausal women has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about this issue is the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of CEMPA (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). The results from observational studies are generally consistent with those of the WHI clinical trial and report no significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogens or progestins, doses, or routes of administration. The CEMPA substudy of WHI reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took CEMPA for a mean followup of 5.6 years. Observational studies have also reported an increased risk for estrogenprogestin combination therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen alone therapy, after several years of use. In the WHI trial and from observational studies, the excess risk increased with duration of use. From observational studies, the risk appeared to return to baseline in about five years after stopping treatment. In addition, observational studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogenprogestin combination therapy as compared to estrogen alone therapy. In the CEMPA substudy, 26 of the women reported prior use of estrogen alone andor estrogenprogestin combination hormone therapy. After a mean followup of 5.6 years during the clinical trial, the overall relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 (95 confidence interval 1.011.54), and the overall absolute risk was 41 vs 33 cases per 10,000 womenyears, for CEMPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 vs 25 cases per 10,000 womenyears, for CEMPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 vs 36 cases per 10,000 womenyears for CEMPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CEMPA group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast selfexaminations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. 3. Dementia In the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), 4,532 generally healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older were studied, of whom 35 were 70 to 74 years of age and 18 were 75 or older. After an average followup of 4 years, 40 women being treated with CEMPA (1.8, n  2,229) and 21 women in the placebo group (0.9, n  2,303) received diagnoses of probable dementia. The relative risk for CEMPA vs placebo was 2.05 (95 confidence interval 1.21  3.48), and was similar for women with and without histories of menopausal hormone use before WHIMS. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CEMPA vs placebo was 45 vs 22 cases per 10,000 womenyears, and the absolute excess risk for CEMPA was 23 cases per 10,000 womenyears. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use.) It is unknown whether these findings apply to estrogen alone therapy. 4. Gallbladder Disease A 2 to 4fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5. Hypercalcemia Administration of estrogen may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level. 6. Visual A bnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.</td></tr>

In the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study, including 4,532 women 65 years of age and older, followed for an average of 4 years, 82 (n  3,729) were 65 to 74 while 18 (n  803) were 75 and over. Most women (80) had no prior hormone therapy use. Women treated with conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate were reported to have a twofold increase in the risk of developing probable dementia. Alzheimers disease was the most common classification of probable dementia in both the conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate group and the placebo group. Ninety percent of the cases of probable dementia occurred in the 54 of women that were older than 70. (See WARNINGS, Dementia.) It is unknown whether these findings apply to estrogen alone therapy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogenresponsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. Figure 1 Steady State Estradiol Plasma Concentrations for Systems Applied to the Abdomen Nonbaseline corrected levels Figure 2 Mean (SD) change from baseline in mean daily number of flushes for Vivelle 0.0375 mg versus Placebo in a 12 week trial. Figure 3 Bone mineral density AP Lumbar spine Least squares means of percentage change from baseline All randomized patients with at least one post baseline assessment available with last post baseline observation carried forward Figure 4 Bone mineral density Femoral neck Least squares means of percentage change from baseline All randomized patients with at least one post baseline assessment available with last post baseline observation carried forward Pharmacokinetics The skin metabolizes estradiol only to a small extent. In contrast, orally administered estradiol is rapidly metabolized by the liver to estrone and its conjugates, giving rise to higher circulating levels of estrone than estradiol. Therefore, transdermal administration produces therapeutic plasma levels of estradiol with lower circulating levels of estrone and estrone conjugates and requires smaller total doses than does oral therapy. Absorption In a multipledose study consisting of three consecutive system applications of the original formulation Vivelle (estradiol transdermal system) which was conducted in 17 healthy, postmenopausal women, blood levels of estradiol and estrone were compared following application of these units to sites on the abdomen and buttocks in a crossover fashion. Systems that deliver nominal estradiol doses of approximately 0.0375 mgday and 0.1 mgday were applied to abdominal application sites while the 0.1 mgday doses were also applied to sites on the buttocks. These systems increased estradiol levels above baseline within 4 hours and maintained respective mean levels of 25 and 79 pgmL above baseline following application to the abdomen slightly higher mean levels of 88 pgmL above baseline were observed following application to the buttocks. At the same time, increases in estrone plasma concentrations averaged about 12 and 50 pgmL, respectively, following application to the abdomen and 61 pgmL for the buttocks. While plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone remained slightly above baseline at 12 hours following removal of the systems in this study, results from another study show these levels to return to baseline values within 24 hours following removal of the systems. Figure 1 illustrates the mean plasma concentrations of estradiol at steadystate during application of these patches at four different dosages. Figure 1SteadyState Estradiol Plasma Concentrations for Systems Applied to the AbdomenNonbaselinecorrected levels The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in the table below. Table 1 SteadyState Estradiol Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Systems Applied to the Abdomen (mean  standard deviation) Nonbaselinecorrected data Dosage (mgday) Cmax (pgmL) Cavg (pgmL) Cmin (84 hr) (pgmL) 0.0375 46  16 34  10 30 10 0.05 83  41 57  23 41  11 0.075 99  35 72  24 60  24 0.1 133  51 89  38 90  44 0.1 145  71 104  52 85  47 Mean baseline estradiol concentration  11.7 pgmL Peak plasma concentration Average plasma concentration Minimum plasma concentration at 84 hr Measured over 80 hr Applied to the buttocks VivelleDot (estradiol transdermal system), the revised formulation with smaller system sizes, was shown to be bioequivalent to the original formulation, Vivelle (estradiol transdermal system), used in the clinical trials. Distribution No specific investigation of the tissue distribution of estradiol absorbed from VivelleDot in humans has been conducted. The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormonebinding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the gut followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. Excretion Estradiol, estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The halflife values calculated after dosing with the VivelleDot ranged from 5.9 to 7.7 hours. After removal of the transdermal systems, serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone returned to baseline levels within 24 hours. Special Populations VivelleDot was only investigated in postmenopausal women. Drug Interactions In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. Johns Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects andor changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects. Adhesion Based on combined data from three shortterm clinical trials consisting of 471 observations, 85 of VivelleDot adhered completely to the skin over the 3.5day wear period. Three (3) of the systems detached and were reapplied or replaced during the 3.5day wear period. Approximately 80 of the transdermal systems evaluated in these studies were VivelleDot 0.05 mgday. Clinical Studies Effects on vasomotor symptoms In a pharmacokinetic study, VivelleDot was shown to be bioequivalent to Vivelle. In two controlled clinical trials with Vivelle, of 356 subjects, the 0.075 and 0.1 mg doses were superior to placebo in relieving vasomotor symptoms at Week 4, and maintained efficacy through Weeks 8 and 12 of treatment. In this original study, the 0.0375 and 0.05 mg doses, however, did not differ from placebo until approximately Week 6, therefore, an additional 12week placebocontrolled study in 255 patients was performed with Vivelle to establish the efficacy of the lowest dose of 0.0375 mg. The baseline mean daily number of hot flushes in these 255 patients was 11.5. Results at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 of treatment are shown in the figure below. (See Figure 2.) Figure 2 Mean (SD) change from baseline in mean daily number of flushes for Vivelle 0.0375 mg versus Placebo in a 12week trial. The 0.0375 mg dose was superior to placebo in reducing both the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms at Week 4 and maintained efficacy through Weeks 8 and 12 of treatment. All doses of Vivelle (0.0375 mg, 0.05 mg, 0.075 mg, and 0.1 mg) are effective for the control of vasomotor symptoms. Effects on bone mineral density Efficacy and safety of Vivelle in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis have been studied in a 2year doubleblind, randomized, placebocontrolled, parallel group study. A total of 261 hysterectomized (161) and nonhysterectomized (100), surgically or naturally menopausal women (within 5 years of menopause), with no evidence of osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density within 2 standard deviations of average peak bone mass, i.e., 0.827 gcm2) were enrolled in this study 194 patients were randomized to one of the four doses of Vivelle (0.1, 0.05, 0.0375, or 0.025 mgday) and 67 patients to placebo. Over 2 years, study systems were applied to the buttock or the abdomen twice a week. Nonhysterectomized women received oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mgday) throughout the study. The study population comprised naturally (82) or surgically (18) menopausal, hysterectomized (61) or nonhysterectomized (39) women with a mean age of 52.0 years (range 27 to 62 years) the mean duration of menopause was 31.7 months (range 2 to 72 months). Two hundred thirtytwo (89) of randomized subjects (173 on active drug, 59 on placebo) contributed data to the analysis of percent change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) of the AP lumbar spine, the primary efficacy variable. Patients were given supplemental dietary calcium (1000 mg elemental calciumday) but no supplemental vitamin D. There was an increase in BMD of the AP lumbar spine in all Vivelle dose groups in contrast to this, a decrease in AP lumbar spine BMD was observed in placebo patients. All Vivelle doses were significantly superior to placebo (p0.05) at all time points with the exception of Vivelle 0.05 mgday at 6 months. The highest dose of Vivelle was superior to the three lower doses. There were no statistically significant differences in pairwise comparisons among the three lower doses. (See Figure 3.) Figure 3 Bone mineral density  AP Lumbar spine Least squares means of percentage change from baseline All randomized patients with at least one postbaseline assessment available with last postbaseline observation carried forward Analysis of percent change from baseline in femoral neck BMD, a secondary efficacy outcome variable, showed qualitatively similar results all doses of Vivelle were significantly superior to placebo (p0.05) at 24 months. The highest Vivelle dose was superior to placebo at all time points. A mixture of significant and nonsignificant results were obtained for the lower dose groups at earlier time points. The highest Vivelle dose was superior to the three lower doses, and there were no significant differences among the three lower doses at this skeletal site. (See Figure 4.) Figure 4 Bone mineral density  Femoral neck Least squares means of percentage change from baseline All randomized patients with at least one postbaseline assessment available with last postbaseline observation carried forward The mean serum osteocalcin (a marker of bone formation) and urinary excretion of crosslink Ntelopeptides of Type 1 collagen (a marker of bone resorption) decreased numerically in most of the active treatment groups relative to baseline. However, the decreases in both markers were inconsistent across treatment groups and the differences between active treatment groups and placebo were not statistically significant. Womens Health Initiative Studies The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled a total of 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women to assess the risks and benefits of the use of oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens (CE) per day alone or the use of oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) per day compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome studied. A global index included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. The study did not evaluate the effects of CE or CEMPA on menopausal symptoms. The CEMPA substudy was stopped early because, according to the predefined stopping rule, the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the global index. Results of the CEMPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average age of 63 years, range 50 to 79, 83.9 White, 6.5 Black, 5.5 Hispanic), after an average followup of 5.2 years are presented in Table 2 below.

The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10,000 womenyears. There was no difference between the groups in terms of allcause mortality (See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS.) Womens Health Initiative Memory Study The Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 were age 65 to 69 years, 35 were 70 to 74 years, and 18 were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of CEMPA (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared with placebo. After an average followup of 4 years, 40 women in the estrogenprogestin group (45 per 10,000 womenyears) and 21 in the placebo group (22 per 10,000 womenyears) were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia in the hormone therapy group was 2.05 (95 CI, 1.21 to 3.48) compared to placebo. Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS, Dementia.)</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>ESTROGENS INCREASE THE RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER Close clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogens is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens at equivalent estrogen doses. (See WARNINGS, Malignant Neoplasms, Endometrial Cancer.) CARDIOVASCULAR AND OTHER RISKS Estrogens with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. (See WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders.) The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age), during 5 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens (CE 0.625 mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 2.5 mg) relative to placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). The Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, reported increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women or to women taking estrogen alone therapy. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies.) Other doses of oral conjugated estrogens with medroxyprogesterone acetate, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins were not studied in the WHI clinical trials and, in the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar. Because of these risks, estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>Pharmacokinetics AbsorptionEstrogens are well absorbed through the skin and gastrointestinal tract. When applied for a local action, absorption is usually sufficient to cause systemic effects. DistributionThe distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. MetabolismExogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the gut followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. ExcretionEstradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Drug Interactions In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. Johns Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects andor changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here A. GENERAL 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomyStudies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogenalone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer, adverse effects on lipoprotein metabolism (e.g., lowering HDL, raising LDL) and impairment of glucose tolerance. 2. Elevated blood pressureIn a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use. 3. HypertriglyceridemiaIn patients with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications. 4. Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundiceEstrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 5. HypothyroidismEstrogen administration leads to increased thyroidbinding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 6. Fluid retentionBecause estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. 7. HypocalcemiaEstrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia. 8. Ovarian cancerThe CEMPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average followup of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CEMPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 confidence interval 0.77  3.24) but was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CEMPA versus placebo was 4.2 versus 2.7 cases per 10,000 womenyears. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen alone, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations. 9. Exacerbation of endometriosisEndometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated posthysterectomy with estrogen alone therapy. For patients known to have residual endometriosis posthysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. 10. Exacerbation of other conditionsEstrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. PATIENT INFORMATION Physicians are advised to discuss the PATIENT INFORMATION leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe estropipate tablets. C. LABORATORY TESTS Estrogen administration should be initiated at the lowest dose approved for the indication and then guided by clinical response rather than by serum hormone levels (e.g., estradiol, FSH). D. DRUG LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time increased platelet count increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII X complex, IIVIIX complex, and betathromboglobulin decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroidbinding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, levels as measured by proteinbound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Patients on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, (i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormonebinding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free or biologically active hormone concentrations are unchanged. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogenrenin substrate, alpha1antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma HDL and HDL2 subfraction concentrations, reduced LDL cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. Reduced response to metyrapone test. Reduced serum folate concentration. E. CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Longterm continuous administration of estrogen, with and without progestin, in women with and without a uterus, has shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. (See BOXED WARNINGS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS .) Longterm continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver. F. PREGNANCY Estropipate tablets should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) G. NURSING MOTHERS Estrogen administration to nursing mothers has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving this drug. Caution should be exercised when estropipate is administered to a nursing woman. H. GERIATRIC USE In the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study, including 4,532 women 65 years of age and older, followed for an average of 4 years, 82 (n 3,729) were 65 to 74 while 18 (n 803) were 75 and over. Most women (80) had no prior hormone therapy use. Women treated with conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate were reported to have a twofold increase in the risk of developing probable dementia. Alzheimers disease was the most common classification of probable dementia in both the conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate group and the placebo group. Ninety percent of the cases of probable dementia occurred in the 54 of women that were older than 70. (See WARNINGS, Dementia .)</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE Estropipate tablets are indicated in the Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause. Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulval and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause. When prescribing solely for the treatment of symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, topical vaginal products should be considered. Treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration or primary ovarian failure. Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should only be considered for women at significant risk of osteoporosis and for whom nonestrogen medications are not considered to be appropriate. The mainstays for decreasing the risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis are weightbearing exercise, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, and when indicated, pharmacologic therapy. Postmenopausal women require an average of 1500 mgday of elemental calcium. Therefore, when not contraindicated, calcium supplementation may be helpful for women with suboptimal dietary intake. Vitamin D supplementation of 400800 IUday may also be required to ensure adequate daily intake in postmenopausal women.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS 1. Cardiovascular disorders Estrogen and estrogenprogestin therapy have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (venous thromboembolism or VTE). Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) andor venous thromboembolism (e.g., personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Coronary heart disease and strokeIn the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) study, an increase in the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes has been observed in women receiving CE compared to placebo. These observations are preliminary, and the study is continuing. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies .) In the CEMPA substudy of WHI, an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death) was observed in women receiving CEMPA compared to women receiving placebo (37 vs. 30 per 10,000 womenyears). The increase in risk was observed in year one and persisted. In the same substudy of WHI, an increased risk of stroke was observed in women receiving CEMPA compared to women receiving placebo (29 vs. 21 per 10,000 womenyears). The increase in risk was observed after the first year and persisted. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n  2,763, average age 66.7 years) a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and EstrogenProgestin Replacement Study HERS) treatment with CEMPA (0.625 mg2.5 mg per day) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average followup of 4.1 years, treatment with CEMPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CEMPAtreated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty one women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average followup in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CEMPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis. b. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) In the Womens Health study (WHI) an increase in VTE has been observed in women receiving CE compared to placebo. These observations are preliminary, and the study is continuing. In the CEMPA treatment substudy of WHI, a 2fold greater rate of VTE, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, was observed in women receiving treatment with CEMPA compared to women receiving placebo. The rate of VTE was 34 per 10,000 womanyears in the CEMPA group compared to 16 per 10,000 womanyears in the placebo group. The increase in VTE risk was observed during the first year and persisted. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant neoplasms a. Endometrial cancerThe use of unopposed estrogens in women with intact uteri has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2to12 fold greater than in nonusers, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than one year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15to24 fold for five to ten years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogenprogestin combinations is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. b. Breast cancerThe use of estrogens and progestins by postmenopausal women has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about this issue is the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of CEMPA (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies ). The results from observational studies are generally consistent with those of the WHI clinical trial and report no significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogens or progestins, doses, or routes of administration. The CEMPA substudy of WHI reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took CEMPA for a mean followup of 5.6 years. Observational studies have also reported an increased risk for estrogenprogestin combination therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen alone therapy, after several years of use. In the WHI trial and from observational studies, the excess risk increased with duration of use. From observational studies, the risk appeared to return to baseline in about five years after stopping treatment. In addition, observational studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogenprogestin combination therapy as compared to estrogen alone therapy. In the CEMPA substudy, 26 of the women reported prior use of estrogen alone andor estrogenprogestin combination hormone therapy. After a mean followup of 5.6 years during the clinical trial, the overall relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 (95 confidence interval 1.011.54), and the overall absolute risk was 41 vs. 33 cases per 10,000 womenyears, for CEMPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 vs. 25 cases per 10,000 womenyears, for CEMPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 vs. 36 cases per 10,000 womenyears for CEMPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CEMPA group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between groups. The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a health care provider and perform monthly breast selfexaminations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. 3. Dementia In the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), 4,532 generally healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older were studied, of whom 35 were 70 to 74 years of age and 18 were 75 or older. After an average followup of 4 years, 40 women being treated with CEMPA (1.8, n 2,229) and 21 women in the placebo group (0.9, n 2,303) received diagnoses of probable dementia. The relative risk for CEMPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 confidence interval 1.21  3.48), and was similar for women with and without histories of menopausal hormone use before WHIMS. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CEMPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 womenyears. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .) 4. Gallbladder disease A 2 to 4fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5. Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level. 6. Visual abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>B. PATIENT INFORMATION Physicians are advised to discuss the PATIENT INFORMATION leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe estropipate tablets., SUPPLEMENTAL PATIENT MATERIAL PATIENT INFORMATION Estropipate Tablets USP Read this PATIENT INFORMATION before you start taking estropipate tablets and read what you get each time you refill estropipate tablets. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your health care provider about your medical condition or your treatment. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ESTROPIPATE (AN ESTROGEN HORMONE)?  Estrogens increase the chances of getting cancer of the uterus. Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away while you are taking estrogens. Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterine (womb). Your health care provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause.  Do not use estrogens with or without progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks or strokes. Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your chances of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer and blood clots. You and your health care provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with estropipate tablets. What is estropipate? Estropipate is a medicine that contains estrogen hormones. What is estropipate used for? Estropipate is used during and after menopause to reduce moderate or severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones made by a womans ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the change of life or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes surgical menopause. When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating (hot flashes or hot flushes). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they do not need to use estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your health care provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with estropipate tablets. treat moderate to severe dryness, itching, and burning in and around the vagina. You and your health care provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with estropipate tablets to control these problems. If you use estropipate tablets only to treat your dryness, itching, and burning in and around your vagina, talk with your health care provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you. help reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis (thin weak bones). Osteoporosis from menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break. If you use estropipate tablets only to prevent osteoporosis from menopause, talk with your health care provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you. You and your health care provider should talk regularly about whether you should continue with estropipate tablets. Weightbearing exercise, like walking or running, and taking calcium and vitamin D supplements may also lower your chances of getting postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is important to talk about exercise and supplements with your health care provider before starting them. Estropipate is also used to treat certain conditions in women before menopause if their ovaries do not make enough estrogen naturally. Who should not take estropipate tablets? Do not start taking estropipate tablets if you have unusual vaginal bleeding. currently have or have had certain cancers. Estrogens may increase the chances of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or had cancer, talk with your health care provider about whether you should take estropipate tablets. had a stroke or heart attack in the past year. currently have or have had blood clots. currently have or have had liver problems. are allergic to estropipate tablets or any of its ingredients. See the end of this leaflet for a list of ingredients in estropipate tablets. think you may be pregnant. Tell your health care provider if you are breastfeeding. The hormone in estropipate tablets can pass into your milk. about all of your medical problems. Your health care provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions, such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), migraine, endometriosis, or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium levels in your blood. about all the medicines you take. This includes prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how estropipate works. Estropipate may also affect how your other medicines work. if you are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest. You may need to stop taking estrogens. How should I take estropipate tablets? Take estropipate tablets as directed by your health care provider. Estropipate comes in four strengths. Check with your health care provider periodically to make sure you are using the appropriate dose. Estropipate Tablets USP Revised April 2006 Rx only 1. Start at the lowest dose and talk to your health care provider about how well that dose is working for you. 2. Estrogens should be used at the lowest dose possible for your treatment only as long as needed. The lowest effective dose of estropipate has not been determined. You and your health care provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about whether you still need treatment with estropipate tablets. What are the possible side effects of estrogens? Less common but serious side effects include Breast cancer Cancer of the uterus Stroke Heart attack Blood clots Gallbladder disease Ovarian cancer These are some of the warning signs of serious side effects Breast lumps Unusual vaginal bleeding Dizziness and faintness Changes in speech Severe headaches Chest pain Shortness of breath Pains in your legs Changes in vision Vomiting Call your health care provider right away if you get any of these warning signs, or any other unusual symptom that concerns you. Common side effects include Headache Breast pain Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting Stomachabdominal cramps, bloating Nausea and vomiting Other side effects include High blood pressure Liver problems High blood sugar Fluid retention Enlargement of benign tumors of the uterus (fibroids) Vaginal yeast infections Hair loss These are not all the possible side effects of estropipate tablets. For more information, ask your health care provider or pharmacist. What can I do to lower my chances of getting a serious side effect with estropipate tablets? Talk with your health care provider regularly about whether you should continue taking estropipate tablets. If you have a uterus, talk to your health care provider about whether the addition of a progestin is right for you. See your health care provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking estropipate tablets. Have a breast exam and mammogram (breast Xray) every year unless your health care provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast examinations more often. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are <b style='color:red'>overweight</b>, or if you use tobacco, you may have higher chances for getting heart disease. Ask your health care provider for ways to lower your chances for getting heart disease.

<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>A. GENERAL 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomyStudies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogenalone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer, adverse effects on lipoprotein metabolism (e.g., lowering HDL, raising LDL) and impairment of glucose tolerance. 2. Elevated blood pressureIn a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use. 3. HypertriglyceridemiaIn patients with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications. 4. Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundiceEstrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 5. HypothyroidismEstrogen administration leads to increased thyroidbinding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 6. Fluid retentionBecause estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. 7. HypocalcemiaEstrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia. 8. Ovarian cancerThe CEMPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average followup of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CEMPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 confidence interval 0.77  3.24) but was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CEMPA versus placebo was 4.2 versus 2.7 cases per 10,000 womenyears. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen alone, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations. 9. Exacerbation of endometriosisEndometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated posthysterectomy with estrogen alone therapy. For patients known to have residual endometriosis posthysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. 10. Exacerbation of other conditionsEstrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>DESCRIPTION Estropipate (formerly piperazine estrone sulfate), is a natural estrogenic substance prepared from purified crystalline estrone, solubilized as the sulfate and stabilized with piperazine. It is appreciably soluble in water and has almost no odor or taste  properties which are ideally suited for oral administration. The amount of piperazine in estropipate is not sufficient to exert a pharmacological action. Its addition ensures solubility, stability, and uniform potency of the estrone sulfate.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION When estrogen is prescribed for a woman with a uterus, progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3month to 6month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (See BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS .) For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, vulval and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the lowest dose and regimen that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible. Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at 3month to 6month intervals. Usual dosage ranges Vasomotor symptomsOne estropipate 0.75 mg tablet to two estropipate 3 mg tablets per day. The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be chosen. If the patient has not menstruated within the last two months or more, cyclic administration is started arbitrarily. If the patient is menstruating, cyclic administration is started on day 5 of bleeding. Vulval and vaginal atrophyOne estropipate 0.75 mg tablet to two estropipate 3 mg tablets daily, depending upon the tissue response of the individual patient. The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be chosen. Administer cyclically. For treatment of female hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure. Usual dosage ranges Female hypogonadismA daily dose of one estropipate 1.5 mg tablet to three estropipate 3 mg tablets may be given for the first three weeks of a theoretical cycle, followed by a rest period of eight to ten days. The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be chosen. If bleeding does not occur by the end of this period, the same dosage schedule is repeated. The number of courses of estrogen therapy necessary to produce bleeding may vary depending on the responsiveness of the endometrium. If satisfactory withdrawal bleeding does not occur, an oral progestogen may be given in addition to estrogen during the third week of the cycle. Female castration or primary ovarian failureA daily dose of one estropipate 1.5 mg tablet to three estropipate 3 mg tablets may be given for the first three weeks of a theoretical cycle, followed by a rest period of eight to ten days. Adjust dosage upward or downward according to severity of symptoms and response of the patient. For maintenance, adjust dosage to lowest level that will provide effective control. Treated patients with an intact uterus should be monitored closely for signs of endometrial cancer and appropriate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out malignancy in the event of persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. For prevention of osteoporosis. A daily dose of one estropipate 0.75 mg tablet for 25 days of a 31day cycle per month.</td></tr>

GERIATRIC USE In the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study, including 4,532 women 65 years of age and older, followed for an average of 4 years, 82 (n 3,729) were 65 to 74 while 18 (n 803) were 75 and over. Most women (80) had no prior hormone therapy use. Women treated with conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate were reported to have a twofold increase in the risk of developing probable dementia. Alzheimers disease was the most common classification of probable dementia in both the conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate group and the placebo group. Ninety percent of the cases of probable dementia occurred in the 54 of women that were older than 70. (See WARNINGS, Dementia .)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogenresponsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. Pharmacokinetics AbsorptionEstrogens are well absorbed through the skin and gastrointestinal tract. When applied for a local action, absorption is usually sufficient to cause systemic effects. DistributionThe distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. MetabolismExogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the gut followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. ExcretionEstradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Drug Interactions In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. Johns Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects andor changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole Clinical Studies Womens Health Initiative StudiesThe Womens Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled a total of 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women to assess the risks and benefits of either the use of 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens (CE) per day alone or the use of oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) per day compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome studied. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. The study did not evaluate the effects of CE or CEMPA on menopausal symptoms. The CEMPA substudy was stopped early because, according to the predefined stopping rule, the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index."

Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose (target dose of 160 mgkgday) were approximately 40 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single oral dose of 100 mg. The highest dose administered to rats (160 mgkgday, reduced from 360 mgkgday during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity. Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatmentrelated decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mgkgday. The highest noeffect dose for this finding was 5 mgkgday, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with treatment of the males or females or both combined. In a similar study by the subcutaneous route there was no evidence of impaired fertility at 60 mgkgday, the maximum dose tested, which is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, IMITREX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality  When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mgkgday, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2.0 mgkgday. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest noeffect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mgkgday, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest noeffect dose was 0.75 mgkgday, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mgkgday, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mgkgday, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryofetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Teratogenicity  Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mgkgday or higher. The highest noeffect dose was approximately 60 mgkgday, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest noeffect dose for these effects was 15 mgkgday, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tailshort body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mgkgday. The highest noeffect dose was 50 mgkgday, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mgkgday, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mgkgday or higher. The highest noeffect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mgkgday, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mgkgday. The highest noeffect dose for this finding was 100 mgkgday, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mgkgday, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>Pharmacokinetics The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ngmL (range 7 to 47 ngmL) and 51 ngmL (range 28 to 100 ngmL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a Cmax of 5 and 16 ngmL following dosing with a 5 and 20mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean Cmax following a 6mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ngmL (range 49 to 110 ngmL). The bioavailability is approximately 15, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The Cmax is similar during a migraine attack and during a migrainefree period, but the Tmax is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve AUC) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the Cmax after 100 mg is approximately 25 less than expected (based on the 25mg dose). A food effect study involving administration of IMITREX Tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a highfat meal indicated that the Cmax and AUC were increased by 15 and 12, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Plasma protein binding is low (14 to 21). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 Lkg. The elimination halflife of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14Csumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60) with about 40 found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3 of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAOB inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of IMITREX Tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of IMITREX (sumatriptan) Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of IMITREX Injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS). IMITREX should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function. There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS). For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose. Overuse Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migrainelike daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use. Information for Patients See PATIENT INFORMATION at the end of this labeling for the text of the separate leaflet provided for patients. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of sumatriptan or other triptans, especially during combined use with SSRIs or SNRIs. Laboratory Tests No specific laboratory tests are recommended for monitoring patients prior to andor after treatment with sumatriptan. Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake InhibitorsSerotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of lifethreatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS). ErgotContaining Drugs Ergotcontaining drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotaminecontaining or ergottype medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Monoamine Oxidase  A Inhibitors MAOA inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of IMITREX Tablets in patients receiving MAOA inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS). DrugLaboratory Test Interactions IMITREX Tablets are not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies, rats and mice were given sumatriptan by oral gavage (rats 104 weeks) or drinking water (mice 78 weeks). Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose (target dose of 160 mgkgday) were approximately 40 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single oral dose of 100 mg. The highest dose administered to rats (160 mgkgday, reduced from 360 mgkgday during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity. Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatmentrelated decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mgkgday. The highest noeffect dose for this finding was 5 mgkgday, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with treatment of the males or females or both combined. In a similar study by the subcutaneous route there was no evidence of impaired fertility at 60 mgkgday, the maximum dose tested, which is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, IMITREX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality  When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mgkgday, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2.0 mgkgday. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest noeffect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mgkgday, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest noeffect dose was 0.75 mgkgday, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mgkgday, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mgkgday, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryofetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Teratogenicity  Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mgkgday or higher. The highest noeffect dose was approximately 60 mgkgday, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest noeffect dose for these effects was 15 mgkgday, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tailshort body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mgkgday. The highest noeffect dose was 50 mgkgday, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mgkgday, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mgkgday or higher. The highest noeffect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mgkgday, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mgkgday. The highest noeffect dose for this finding was 100 mgkgday, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mgkgday, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mgm2 basis. Nursing Mothers Sumatriptan is excreted in human breast milk following subcutaneous administration. Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with IMITREX Tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of IMITREX Tablets in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established therefore, IMITREX Tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluating sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 1,248 adolescent migraineurs who treated a single attack. The studies did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single attack studies, 3 multiple attack studies) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These studies did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse events in these patients appeared to be both dose and agedependent, with younger patients reporting events more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse events have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, andor intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include events similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14yearold male following the use of oral sumatriptan clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Since clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in pediatric patients who might receive injectable, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available, the use of sumatriptan in patients aged younger than 18 years is not recommended. Geriatric Use The use of sumatriptan in elderly patients is not recommended because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic function, they are at higher risk for CAD, and blood pressure increases may be more pronounced in the elderly (see WARNINGS).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Treatment with MAOA inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic firstpass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAOA inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAOA inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration  time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40 increase in elimination halflife. This interaction was not evident with an MAOB inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAOA inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan., Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake InhibitorsSerotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of lifethreatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS).

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg of IMITREX Tablets were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. There is evidence that doses of 50 and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than 25 mg (see CLINICAL TRIALS). There is also evidence that doses of 100 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. Individuals may vary in response to doses of IMITREX Tablets. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events. If the headache returns or the patient has a partial response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 200 mg. If a headache returns following an initial treatment with IMITREX Injection, additional single IMITREX Tablets (up to 100 mgday) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30day period has not been established. Because of the potential of MAOA inhibitors to cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of oral sumatriptan, their combined use is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Hepatic diseasefunctional impairment may also cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of orally administered sumatriptan. Consequently, if treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of liver disease, the maximum single dose should in general not exceed 50 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for the basis of this recommendation).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS IMITREX Tablets should not be given to patients with history, symptoms, or signs of ischemic cardiac, cerebrovascular , or peripheral vascular syndromes. In addition, patients with other significant underlying cardiovascular diseases should not receive IMITREX Tablets. Ischemic cardiac syndromes include, but are not limited to, angina pectoris of any type (e.g., stable angina of effort, vasospastic forms of angina such as the Prinzmetal variant), all forms of myocardial infarction, and silent myocardial ischemia. Cerebrovascular syndromes include, but are not limited to, strokes of any type as well as transient ischemic attacks. Peripheral vascular disease includes, but is not limited to, ischemic bowel disease (see WARNINGS). Because IMITREX Tablets may increase blood pressure, they should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Concurrent administration of MAO A inhibitors or use within 2 weeks of discontinuation of MAOA inhibitor therapy is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions). IMITREX Tablets should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine. IMITREX Tablets and any ergotaminecontaining or ergottype medication (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide ) should not be used within 24 hours of each other, nor should IMITREX and another 5HT1 agonist. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sumatriptan or any of their components. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of IMITREX Injection or Tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebocontrolled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2 or more in any group treated with IMITREX Tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

IMITREX Tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to longlasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of IMITREX Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX Tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used IMITREX Tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N  6,348) exposed to IMITREX Tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1100 to 11,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 11,000 patients.

<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>General Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of IMITREX Tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of IMITREX (sumatriptan) Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of IMITREX Injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS). IMITREX should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function. There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS). For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>DESCRIPTION IMITREX Tablets contain sumatriptan (as the succinate), a selective 5hydroxytryptamine1 receptor subtype agonist. Sumatriptan succinate is chemically designated as 32(dimethylamino)ethylNmethylindole5methanesulfonamide succinate (11), and it has the following structure The empirical formula is C14H21N3O2SC4H6O4, representing a molecular weight of 413.5. Sumatriptan succinate is a white to offwhite powder that is readily soluble in water and in saline. Each IMITREX Tablet for oral administration contains 35, 70, or 140 mg of sumatriptan succinate equivalent to 25, 50, or 100 mg of sumatriptan, respectively. Each tablet also contains the inactive ingredients croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium bicarbonate. Each 100mg tablet also contains hypromellose, iron oxide, titanium dioxide, and triacetin. Imitrex Tablets Chemical Structure</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS IMITREX Tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. Risk of Myocardial Ischemia andor Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patients medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of sumatriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physicians office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received sumatriptan . Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following IMITREX Tablets in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent longterm users of sumatriptan and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use sumatriptan . The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan . DrugAssociated Cardiac Events and Fatalities Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, lifethreatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of IMITREX (sumatriptan succinate) Injection or IMITREX Tablets. Considering the extent of use of sumatriptan in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low. The fact that sumatriptan can cause coronary vasospasm, that some of these events have occurred in patients with no prior cardiac disease history and with documented absence of CAD, and the close proximity of the events to sumatriptan use support the conclusion that some of these cases were caused by the drug. In many cases, however, where there has been known underlying coronary artery disease, the relationship is uncertain. Premarketing Experience With Sumatriptan  Of 6,348 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of oral sumatriptan, 2 experienced clinical adverse events shortly after receiving oral sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary vasospasm. Neither of these adverse events was associated with a serious clinical outcome. Among the more than 1,900 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled clinical trials of subcutaneous sumatriptan, there were 8 patients who sustained clinical events during or shortly after receiving sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary artery vasospasm. Six of these 8 patients had ECG changes consistent with transient ischemia, but without accompanying clinical symptoms or signs. Of these 8 patients, 4 had either findings suggestive of CAD or risk factors predictive of CAD prior to study enrollment. Among approximately 4,000 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of sumatriptan nasal spray, 1 patient experienced an asymptomatic subendocardial infarction possibly subsequent to a coronary vasospastic event. Postmarketing Experience With Sumatriptan  Serious cardiovascular events, some resulting in death, have been reported in association with the use of IMITREX Injection or IMITREX Tablets. The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to determine definitively the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by sumatriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases. On clinical grounds, the longer the latency between the administration of IMITREX and the onset of the clinical event, the less likely the association is to be causative. Accordingly, interest has focused on events beginning within 1 hour of the administration of IMITREX. Cardiac events that have been observed to have onset within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration include coronary artery vasospasm, transient ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and death. Some of these events occurred in patients who had no findings of CAD and appear to represent consequences of coronary artery vasospasm. However, among domestic reports of serious cardiac events within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration, almost all of the patients had risk factors predictive of CAD and the presence of significant underlying CAD was established in most cases (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). DrugAssociated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan, and some have resulted in fatalities. The relationship of sumatriptan to these events is uncertain. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, sumatriptan having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should also be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack). Other VasospasmRelated Events Sumatriptan may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Both peripheral vascular ischemia and colonic ischemia with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea have been reported. Very rare reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of sumatriptan. Visual disorders may also be part of a migraine attack. Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including IMITREX, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), andor gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Treatment with IMITREX should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Sumatriptan should be administered with caution to patients with controlled hypertension as transient increases in blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance have been observed in a small proportion of patients. Concomitant Drug Use In patients taking MAOA inhibitors, sumatriptan plasma levels attained after treatment with recommended doses are 7fold higher following oral administration than those obtained under other conditions. Accordingly, the coadministration of IMITREX Tablets and an MAOA inhibitor is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity (anaphylaxisanaphylactoid) reactions have occurred on rare occasions in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan is an agonist for a vascular 5hydroxytryptamine1 receptor subtype (probably a member of the 5HT1D family) having only a weak affinity for 5HT1A, 5HT5A, and 5HT7 receptors and no significant affinity (as measured using standard radioligand binding assays) or pharmacological activity at 5HT2, 5HT3, or 5HT4 receptor subtypes or at alpha1, alpha2, or betaadrenergic dopamine1 dopamine2 muscarinic or benzodiazepine receptors. The vascular 5HT1 receptor subtype that sumatriptan activates is present on cranial arteries in both dog and primate, on the human basilar artery, and in the vasculature of human dura mater and mediates vasoconstriction. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that sumatriptan also activates 5HT1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels. Such an action may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of sumatriptan in humans. In the anesthetized dog, sumatriptan selectively reduces the carotid arterial blood flow with little or no effect on arterial blood pressure or total peripheral resistance. In the cat, sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arteriovenous anastomoses while having little effect on blood flow or resistance in cerebral or extracerebral tissues.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Geriatric Use The use of sumatriptan in elderly patients is not recommended because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic function, they are at higher risk for CAD, and blood pressure increases may be more pronounced in the elderly (see WARNINGS).</td></tr>

In the cat, sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arteriovenous anastomoses while having little effect on blood flow or resistance in cerebral or extracerebral tissues. Pharmacokinetics The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ngmL (range 7 to 47 ngmL) and 51 ngmL (range 28 to 100 ngmL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a Cmax of 5 and 16 ngmL following dosing with a 5 and 20mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean Cmax following a 6mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ngmL (range 49 to 110 ngmL). The bioavailability is approximately 15, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The Cmax is similar during a migraine attack and during a migrainefree period, but the Tmax is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve AUC) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the Cmax after 100 mg is approximately 25 less than expected (based on the 25mg dose). A food effect study involving administration of IMITREX Tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a highfat meal indicated that the Cmax and AUC were increased by 15 and 12, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Plasma protein binding is low (14 to 21). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 Lkg. The elimination halflife of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14Csumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60) with about 40 found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3 of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAOB inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions). Special Populations Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined, but little clinical effect would be expected as sumatriptan is largely metabolized to an inactive substance. Hepatic Impairment The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In 1 small study of hepatically impaired patients (N  8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects, the hepatically impaired patients had an approximately 70 increase in AUC and Cmax and a Tmax 40 minutes earlier compared to the healthy subjects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Age The pharmacokinetics of oral sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in patients with migraine (mean age 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age 30 years) (see PRECAUTIONS Geriatric Use). Gender In a study comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, Cmax, Tmax, and halflife. Race The systemic clearance and Cmax of sumatriptan were similar in black (N  34) and Caucasian (N  38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Treatment with MAOA inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic firstpass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAOA inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAOA inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration  time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40 increase in elimination halflife. This interaction was not evident with an MAOB inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAOA inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of IMITREX Tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled studies. Patients enrolled in these 3 studies were predominately female (87) and Caucasian (97), with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of IMITREX Tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Studies 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 studies. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all studies, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 study, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared to each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving IMITREX Tablets at all doses compared to those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 studies, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 or 100mg group when compared to the 25mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 and 100mg dose groups in any study. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 1. Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials are never reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria andor different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.

The averages displayed are based on pooled data from the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy. KaplanMeier plot with patients not achieving response andor taking rescue within 240 minutes censored to 240 minutes. For patients with migraineassociated nausea, photophobia, andor phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Study 1) and at 4 hours (Studies 1, 2, and 3) following administration of IMITREX Tablets compared to placebo. As early as 2 hours in Studies 2 and 3 or 4 hours in Study 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2. The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraine Over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatmenta aKaplanMeier plot based on data obtained in the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy with patients not using additional treatments censored to 24 hours. Plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose. No remedication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of IMITREX Tablets was unaffected by presence of aura duration of headache prior to treatment gender, age, or weight of the patient relationship to menses or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., betablockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. Figure 1. Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response Within 240 Minutes Figure 2.

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis  Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to mice in two 78week studies at doses of 3, 10, 3020 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.85 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) and 0.25, 2, 8 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.062 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). Rats were dosed for 2 years at doses of 0.25, 1, 2.5, 4 mgkgday (males) and 0.25, 1, 4, 8 mgkgday (females) (equivalent to 0.132 and 0.134 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis, respectively). The incidence of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas was significantly increased in 1 mouse study in female mice dosed at 8 mgkgday (2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). These tumors were not increased in another mouse study in females dosed at 10 or 3020 mgkgday (25 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) in this study, there was a high incidence of early mortalities in males of the 3020 mgkgday group. The incidence of mammary gland adenomas and adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female mice dosed at 2 mgkgday and in female rats dosed at 4 mgkgday (0.5 and 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine elevated serum prolactin levels up to 4fold in rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in mammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin mediated. The relevance for human risk of the finding of prolactin mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown see . 2 2 2 2 2 2 Warnings and Precautions (5.15) Mutagenesis  No evidence of genotoxic potential for olanzapine was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, micronucleus test in mice, the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes, induction of forward mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells, or sister chromatid exchange test in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters. in vivo in vivo Impairment of Fertility  In an oral fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, male mating performance, but not fertility, was impaired at a dose of 22.4 mgkgday and female fertility was decreased at a dose of 3 mgkgday (11 and 1.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis, respectively). Discontinuance of olanzapine treatment reversed the effects on male mating performance. In female rats, the precoital period was increased and the mating index reduced at 5 mgkgday (2.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). Diestrous was prolonged and estrous delayed at 1.1 mgkgday (0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) therefore olanzapine may produce a delay in ovulation. 2 2 2</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C  In oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 18 mgkgday and in rabbits at doses up to 30 mgkgday (9 and 30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis, respectively) no evidence of teratogenicity was observed. In an oral rat teratology study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose of 18 mgkgday (9 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). Gestation was prolonged at 10 mgkgday (5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). In an oral rabbit teratology study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of 30 mgkgday (30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 2 2 2 2 Placental transfer of olanzapine occurs in rat pups. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials with olanzapine in pregnant females. Seven pregnancies were observed during clinical trials with olanzapine, including 2 resulting in normal births, 1 resulting in neonatal death due to a cardiovascular defect, 3 therapeutic abortions, and 1 spontaneous abortion. NonTeratogenic Effects  Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including olanzapine), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Olanzapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Oral Administration, Monotherapy  Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentrations in approximately 6 hours following an oral dose. It is eliminated extensively by first pass metabolism, with approximately 40 of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Food does not affect the rate or extent of olanzapine absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that olanzapine tablets and olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets dosage forms of olanzapine are bioequivalent. Olanzapine displays linear kinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its halflife ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile mean of 30 hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 Lhr (5th to 95th percentile mean of 25 Lhr). Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steadystate concentrations in about 1 week that are approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, halflife, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age. Olanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000 L. It is 93 bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100 ngmL, binding primarily to albumin and  acid glycoprotein. 1 Metabolism and Elimination  Following a single oral dose of C labeled olanzapine, 7 of the dose of olanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57 and 30 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12 of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10Nglucuronide, present at steady state at 44 of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4Ndesmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31 of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed. Direct glucuronidation and cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavincontaining monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway , because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme. 14 In vitro in vivo Specific Populations  Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7 of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of renal impairment on metabolite elimination has not been studied. Renal Impairment  Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (n6) with clinically significant (Childs Pugh Classification A and B) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. Hepatic Impairment  In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination halflife of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly (65 years) than in nonelderly subjects (65 years). Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, especially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism andor pharmacodynamic sensitivity see . Geriatric Dosage and Administration (2)  Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30 lower in women than in men. There were, however, no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed. Gender  Olanzapine clearance is about 40 higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications are not routinely recommended. Smoking Status  studies have shown that exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight differences. Dosage modifications for race are, therefore, not recommended. Race In vivo  The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences in populations. The clearance in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine see . Combined Effects Dosage and Administration (2)  In clinical studies, most adolescents were nonsmokers and this population had a lower average body weight, which resulted in higher average olanzapine exposure compared to adults. Adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risks of using olanzapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Diazepam May potentiate orthostatic hypotension. ( ) 7.1, 7.2 Alcohol May potentiate orthostatic hypotension. ( ) 7.1 Carbamazepine Increased clearance of olanzapine. ( 7.1) Fluvoxamine May increase olanzapine levels. ( ) 7.1 Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in Combination Also refer to the DrugInteractions section of the package insert for Symbyax.

( ) 7.2 Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists May antagonize levodopadopamine agonists. ) (7.2 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy When using olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, refer to the Drug Interactions sections of the package insert for those products. ( ) 7.2 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Olanzapine Diazepam  The coadministration of diazepam with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine see . Drug Interactions (7.2) Cimetidine and Antacids  Single doses of cimetidine (800 mg) or aluminum and magnesiumcontaining antacids did not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine. Inducers of CYP1A2  Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50 increase in the clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance. Alcohol  Ethanol (45 mg70 kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The coadministration of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine see . Drug Interactions (7.2) Inhibitors of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine Fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine of 54 in female nonsmokers and 77 in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC is 52 and 108, respectively. Lower doses of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Fluoxetine Fluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax. Warfarin  Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics see . ) Drug Interactions (7.2 Inducers of CYP1A2 or Glucuronyl Transferase  Omeprazole and rifampin, may cause an increase in olanzapine clearance. Charcoal  The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the Cmax and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose. 7.2 Potential for Olanzapine to Affect Other Drugs CNS Acting Drugs  Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when olanzapine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Antihypertensive Agents  Olanzapine, because of its potential for inducing hypotension, may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists  Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Lithium  Multiple doses of olanzapine (10 mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium. see . Warnings and Precautions (5.16) Valproate Olanzapine (10 mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of valproate. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate. see . Warnings and Precautions (5.16) Effect of Olanzapine on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes  studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes. In vitro Imipramine  Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolite desipramine. Warfarin  Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin see . Drug Interactions (7.1) Diazepam  Olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam or its active metabolite Ndesmethyldiazepam. However, diazepam coadministered with olanzapine increased the orthostatic hypotension observed with either drug given alone. see . Drug Interactions (7.1) Alcohol  Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of ethanol see . Drug Interactions (7.1) Biperiden  Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of biperiden. Theophylline  Multiple doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline or its metabolites.</td></tr>

This database includes (1) 2500 patients who participated in multipledose oral olanzapine premarketing trials in schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease representing approximately 1122 patientyears of exposure as of February 14, 1995 (2) 182 patients who participated in oral olanzapine premarketing bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials representing approximately 66 patientyears of exposure (3) 191 patients who participated in an oral olanzapine trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimers disease representing approximately 29 patientyears of exposure and (4) 5788 patients from 88 additional oral olanzapine clinical trials as of December 31, 2001. In addition, information from the premarketing 6week clinical study database for olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, consisting of 224 patients who participated in bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials with approximately 22 patientyears of exposure, is included below. The conditions and duration of treatment with olanzapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) openlabel and doubleblind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixeddose and dosetitration studies, and shortterm or longerterm exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analytes, ECGs, chest xrays, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Certain portions of the discussion below relating to objective or numeric safety parameters, namely, dosedependent adverse reactions, vital sign changes, weight gain, laboratory changes, and ECG changes are derived from studies in patients with schizophrenia and have not been duplicated for bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes). However, this information is also generally applicable to bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes). Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, MedDRA and COSTART Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. The reported reactions do not include those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not be repeated below. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions occurred during treatment with olanzapine, they were not necessarily caused by it. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of olanzapine. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reactions incidence in the population studied. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled and Combination Trials The following findings are based on premarketing trials of oral olanzapine for Schizophrenia, Bipolar I Disorder (manic or mixed episodes), a subsequent trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimers disease, and premarketing combination trials. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials  Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (5 for oral olanzapine vs 6 for placebo). However, discontinuations due to increases in ALT were considered to be drug related (2 for oral olanzapine vs 0 for placebo). Schizophrenia  Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (2 for oral olanzapine vs 2 for placebo). Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Monotherapy Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ShortTerm Combination Trials  In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 11 for the combination of oral olanzapine with lithium or valproate compared to 2 for patients who remained on lithium or valproate monotherapy. Discontinuations with the combination of oral olanzapine and lithium or valproate that occurred in more than 1 patient were somnolence (3), weight gain (1), and peripheral edema (1). Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes), Olanzapine as Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of oral olanzapine (incidence of 5 or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebotreated patients (olanzapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were Table 9 Common TreatmentEmergent Adverse Reactions Associated with the Use of Oral Olanzapine in 6Week Trials  SCHIZOPHRENIA Adverse Reaction Percentage of Patients Reporting Event Olanzapine Placebo (N248) (N118) Postural hypotension 5 2 Constipation 9 3 Weight gain 6 1 Dizziness 11 4 Personality disorder a 8 4 Akathisia 5 1 Personality disorder is the COSTART term for designating nonaggressive objectionable behavior. a Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2 or More among Oral OlanzapineTreated Patients in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Table 11 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatmentemergent adverse reactions that occurred in 2 or more of patients treated with oral olanzapine (doses 2.5 mgday) and with incidence greater than placebo who participated in the acute phase of placebocontrolled trials.

Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, the frequency and severity are greater with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. In general, an elevated risk of acute dystonia may be observed in males and younger age groups receiving antipsychotics however, events of dystonia have been reported infrequently (1) with olanzapine use.

Within the original premarketing database of about 2400 adult patients with baseline ALT 90 IUL, the incidence of ALT elevations to 200 IUL was 2 (502381). None of these patients experienced jaundice or other symptoms attributable to liver impairment and most had transient changes that tended to normalize while olanzapine treatment was continued. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults In placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adults, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from 3 times the upper limit of normal ULN at baseline to 3 times ULN) were observed in 5 (771426) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 1 (101187) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations 5 times ULN were observed in 2 (291438) of olanzapinetreated patients, compared to 0.3 (41196) of placebotreated patients. ALT values returned to normal, or were decreasing, at last followup in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine. No patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice, liver failure, or met the criteria for Hys Rule. Rare postmarketing reports of hepatitis have been received. Very rare cases of cholestatic or mixed liver injury have also been reported in the postmarketing period. Caution should be exercised in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment, in patients with preexisting conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve, and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Olanzapine administration was also associated with increases in serum prolactin see , with an asymptomatic elevation of the eosinophil count in 0.3 of patients, and with an increase in CPK. Warnings and ) Precautions (5.15 Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents In placebocontrolled clinical trials of adolescent patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), greater frequencies for the following treatmentemergent findings, at anytime, were observed in laboratory analytes compared to placebo elevated ALT (3 X ULN in patients with ALT at baseline 3 X ULN), (12 vs 2) elevated AST (28 vs 4) low total bilirubin (22 vs 7) elevated GGT (10  vs 1) and elevated prolactin (47 vs 7). In placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescents, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from 3 times ULN at baseline to 3 times ULN) were observed in 12 (22192) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 2 (2109) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations 5 times ULN were observed in 4 (8192) of olanzapinetreated patients, compared to 1 (1109) of placebotreated patients. ALT values returned to normal, or were decreasing, at last followup in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine. No adolescent patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice, liver failure, or met the criteria for Hys Rule. ECG Changes In pooled studies of adults as well as pooled studies of adolescents, there were no significant differences between olanzapine and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc (Fridericia corrected), and PR intervals. Olanzapine use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo (adults 2.4 beats per minute vs no change with placebo adolescents 6.3 beats per minute vs 5.1 beats per minute with placebo). This increase in heart rate may be related to olanzapines potential for inducing orthostatic changes see . Warnings and Precautions (5.8) 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of olanzapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to olanzapine therapy include the following allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, pruritus or urticaria), diabetic coma, diabetic ketoacidosis, discontinuation reaction (diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting), jaundice, neutropenia, pancreatitis, priapism, rash, rhabdomyolysis, and venous thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis). Random cholesterol levels of 240 mgdL and random triglyceride levels of 1000 mgdL have been reported.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE template 9.3 Dependence In studies prospectively designed to assess abuse and dependence potential, olanzapine was shown to have acute depressive CNS effects but little or no potential of abuse or physical dependence in rats administered oral doses up to 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (20 mg) and rhesus monkeys administered oral doses up to 8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis. 2 Olanzapine has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic, and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNSactive drug will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of olanzapine (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior).</td></tr>

( ). 2.1 Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in Combination Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should be made with the individual components according to efficacy and tolerability. (2.5) Olanzapine monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. (2.5) Safety of coadministration of doses above 18 mg olanzapine with 75 mg fluoxetine has not been evaluated in adults. (2.5) 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults Dose Selection Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mgday within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should 4 generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 5 mg QD are recommended. Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mgday in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mgday were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mgday dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mgday (i.e., to a dose of 15 mgday or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mgday. Dosing in Special Populations  The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g., nonsmoking female patients 65 years of age), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine see . When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients. Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Maintenance Treatment The effectiveness of oral olanzapine, 10 mgday to 20 mgday, in maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable on olanzapine for approximately 8 weeks and were then followed for relapse has been demonstrated in a placebocontrolled trial see . The physician who elects to use olanzapine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Clinical Studies (14.1) Adolescents Dose Selection  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals with a recommended starting dose of 2.5 or 5 mg, with a target dose of 10 mgday. Efficacy in adolescents with schizophrenia was demonstrated based on a flexible dose range of 2.5 to 20 mgday in clinical trials, with a mean modal dose of 12.5 mgday (mean dose of 11.1 mgday). When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 2.5 or 5 mg are recommended. The safety and effectiveness of doses above 20 mgday have not been evaluated in clinical trials see . Clinical Studies ( ) 14.1 Maintenance Treatment  The efficacy of olanzapine for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in the adolescent population has not been systematically evaluated however, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. Thus, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. 2.2 Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Adults Dose Selection for Monotherapy  Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 10 or 15 mg. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours, reflecting the procedures in the placebocontrolled trials. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 5 mg QD are recommended. Shortterm (34 weeks) antimanic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mgday in clinical trials. The safety of doses above 20 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials see . Clinical Studies (14.2) Maintenance Monotherapy  The benefit of maintaining bipolar I patients on monotherapy with oral olanzapine at a dose of 5 to 20 mgday, after achieving a responder status for an average duration of 2 weeks, was demonstrated in a controlled trial see . The physician who elects to use olanzapine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Clinical Studies (14.2) Dose Selection for Adjunctive Treatment  When administered as adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproate, oral olanzapine dosing should generally begin with 10 mg onceaday without regard to meals. Antimanic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mgday in clinical trials see . The safety of doses above 20 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Clinical Studies (14.2) Adolescents Dose Selection Oral olanzapine should be administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals with a recommended starting dose of 2.5 or 5 mg, with a target dose of 10 mgday. Efficacy in adolescents with bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) was demonstrated based on a flexible dose range of 2.5 to 20 mgday in clinical trials, with a mean modal dose of 10.7 mgday (mean dose of 8.9 mgday). When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose incrementsdecrements of 2.5 or 5 mg are recommended. The safety and effectiveness of doses above 20 mgday have not been evaluated in clinical trials see .

Antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in adult patients with a dose range of olanzapine 6 to 12 mg and fluoxetine 25 to 50 mg. Safety of coadministration of doses above 18 mg olanzapine with 75 mg fluoxetine has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Safety and efficacy of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination was determined in clinical trials supporting approval of Symbyax (fixed dose combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine). Symbyax is dosed between 3 mg25 mg (olanzapinefluoxetine) per day and 12 mg50 mg (olanzapinefluoxetine) per day. The following table demonstrates the appropriate individual component doses of olanzapine and fluoxetine versus Symbyax. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should be made with the individual components according to efficacy and tolerability.

The physician should periodically reexamine the need for continued pharmacotherapy. Olanzapine monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. 2.7 Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in Combination Dosing in Special Populations The starting dose of oral olanzapine 2.55 mg with fluoxetine 20 mg should be used for patients with a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, patients with hepatic impairment, or patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may slow the metabolism of olanzapine or fluoxetine in combination (female gender, geriatric age, nonsmoking status), or those patients who may be pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may slow metabolism. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.

In patients with Schizophrenia, there was no indication of any different tolerability of olanzapine in the elderly compared to younger patients. Studies in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile in this population compared to younger patients with Schizophrenia. Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. In placebocontrolled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis. Also, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance or increase the pharmacodynamic response to olanzapine should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose for any geriatric patient see . , Boxed Warning Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) Clinical studies of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of olanzapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drugs efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT ) antagonism. The mechanism of action of olanzapine in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder is unknown. 2 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Olanzapine binds with high affinity to the following receptors serotonin 5HT , 5HT (K 4, 11, and 5 nM, respectively), dopamine D (K 1131 nM), histamine H (K 7 nM), and adrenergic  receptors (K 19 nM). Olanzapine is an antagonist with moderate affinity binding for serotonin 5HT (K 57 nM) and muscarinic M (K 73, 96, 132, 32, and 48 nM, respectively). Olanzapine binds weakly to GABA , BZD, and  adrenergic receptors (K 10 M). 2A2C 6 i 14 i 1 i 1 i 3 i 15 i A i Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of olanzapine. Olanzapines antagonism of muscarinic M receptors may explain its anticholinergiclike effects. Olanzapines antagonism of histamine H receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Olanzapines antagonism of adrenergic  receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. 2 15 1 1 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Oral Administration, Monotherapy  Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentrations in approximately 6 hours following an oral dose. It is eliminated extensively by first pass metabolism, with approximately 40 of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Food does not affect the rate or extent of olanzapine absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that olanzapine tablets and olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets dosage forms of olanzapine are bioequivalent. Olanzapine displays linear kinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its halflife ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile mean of 30 hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 Lhr (5th to 95th percentile mean of 25 Lhr). Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steadystate concentrations in about 1 week that are approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, halflife, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age. Olanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000 L. It is 93 bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100 ngmL, binding primarily to albumin and  acid glycoprotein. 1 Metabolism and Elimination  Following a single oral dose of C labeled olanzapine, 7 of the dose of olanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57 and 30 of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12 of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10Nglucuronide, present at steady state at 44 of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4Ndesmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31 of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed. Direct glucuronidation and cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavincontaining monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway , because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme. 14 In vitro in vivo Specific Populations  Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7 of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of renal impairment on metabolite elimination has not been studied. Renal Impairment  Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (n6) with clinically significant (Childs Pugh Classification A and B) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. Hepatic Impairment  In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination halflife of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly (65 years) than in nonelderly subjects (65 years). Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, especially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism andor pharmacodynamic sensitivity see . Geriatric Dosage and Administration (2)  Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30 lower in women than in men. There were, however, no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed. Gender  Olanzapine clearance is about 40 higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications are not routinely recommended. Smoking Status  studies have shown that exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight differences. Dosage modifications for race are, therefore, not recommended. Race In vivo  The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences in populations. The clearance in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine see . Combined Effects Dosage and Administration (2)  In clinical studies, most adolescents were nonsmokers and this population had a lower average body weight, which resulted in higher average olanzapine exposure compared to adults.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Clinical Studies section of the package insert for Symbyax. 14.1 Schizophrenia Adults The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of Schizophrenia was established in 2 shortterm (6week) controlled trials of adult inpatients who met DSM IIIR criteria for Schizophrenia. A single haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in 1 of the 2 trials, but this trial did not compare these 2 drugs on the full range of clinically relevant doses for both. Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multiitem inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in Schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of Schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, 2 more recently developed scales were employed these included the 30item Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), in which are embedded the 18 items of the BPRS, and the Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS). The trial summaries below focus on the following outcomes PANSS total andor BPRS total BPRS psychosis cluster PANSS negative subscale or SANS and CGI Severity. The results of the trials follow 1) In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n149) involving 2 fixed olanzapine doses of 1 and 10 mgday (once daily schedule), olanzapine, at 10 mgday (but not at 1 mgday), was superior toplacebo on the PANSS total score (also on the extracted BPRS total), on the BPRS psychosis cluster, on the PANSS Negative subscale, and on CGI Severity. 2) In a 6week, placebocontrolled trial (n253) involving 3 fixed dose ranges of olanzapine (5  2.5 mgday, 10  2.5 mgday, and 15  2.5 mgday) on a once daily schedule, the 2 highest olanzapine dose groups (actual mean doses of 12 and 16 mgday, respectively) were superior to placebo on BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score the highest olanzapine dose group was superior to placebo on the SANS. There was no clear advantage for the highdose group over the mediumdose group. 3) In a longerterm trial, adult outpatients (n326) who predominantly met DSMIV criteria for Schizophrenia and who remained stable on olanzapine during openlabel treatment for at least 8 weeks were randomized to continuation on their current olanzapine doses (ranging from 10 to 20 mgday) or to placebo. The followup period to observe patients for relapse, defined in terms of increases in BPRS positive symptoms or hospitalization, was planned for 12 months, however, criteria were met for stopping the trial early due to an excess of placebo relapses compared to olanzapine relapses, and olanzapine was superior to placebo on time to relapse, the primary outcome for this study. Thus, olanzapine was more effective than placebo at maintaining efficacy in patients stabilized for approximately 8 weeks and followed for an observation period of up to 8 months. Examination of population subsets (race and gender) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings. Adolescents The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) was established in a 6week doubleblind, placebocontrolled, randomized trial of inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia (n107) who met diagnostic criteria according to DSMIVTR and confirmed by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged ChildrenPresent and Lifetime Version (KSADSPL). The primary rating instrument used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in this trial was the Anchored Version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRSC) total score. In this flexibledose trial, olanzapine 2.5 to 20 mgday (mean modal dose 12.5 mgday, mean dose of 11.1 mgday) was more effective than placebo in the treatment of adolescents diagnosed with schizophrenia, as supported by the statistically significantly greater mean reduction in BPRSC total score for patients in the olanzapine treatment group than in the placebo group. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with olanzapine should be maintained, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. It is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. 14.2 Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Adults Monotherapy  The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 shortterm (one 3week and one 4week) placebocontrolled trials in adult patients who met the DSMIV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapidcycling course. The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), an 11item clinicianrated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptiveaggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, languagethought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary outcome in these trials was change from baseline in the YMRS total score. The results of the trials follow (1) In one 3week placebocontrolled trial (n67) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (520 mgday, once daily, starting at 10 mgday), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score. In an identically designed trial conducted simultaneously with the first trial, olanzapine demonstrated a similar treatment difference, but possibly due to sample size and site variability, was not shown to be superior to placebo on this outcome. (2) In a 4week placebocontrolled trial (n115) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (520 mgday, once daily, starting at 15 mgday), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score. (3) In another trial, 361 patients meeting DSMIV criteria for a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder who had responded during an initial openlabel treatment phase for about 2 weeks, on average, to olanzapine 5 to 20 mgday were randomized to either continuation of olanzapine at their same dose (n225) or to placebo (n136), for observation of relapse. Approximately 50 of the patients had discontinued from the olanzapine group by day 59 and 50 of the placebo group had discontinued by day 23 of doubleblind treatment. Response during the openlabel phase was defined by having a decrease of the YMRS total score to 12 and HAMD 21 to 8. Relapse during the doubleblind phase was defined as an increase of the YMRS or HAMD 21 total score to 15, or being hospitalized for either mania or depression. In the randomized phase, patients receiving continued olanzapine experienced a significantly longer time to relapse. Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate  The efficacy of oral olanzapine with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 controlled trials in patients who met the DSMIV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapidcycling course. The results of the trials follow (1) In one 6week placebocontrolled combination trial, 175 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (YMRS 16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, in combination with their original therapy. Olanzapine (in a dose range of 520 mgday, once daily, starting at 10 mgday) combined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEqL to 1.2 mEqL or 50 g mL to 125 gmL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. (2) In a second 6week placebocontrolled combination trial, 169 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (YMRS 16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, in combination with their original therapy. Olanzapine (in a dose range of 520 mgday, once daily, starting at 10 mgday) combined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEqL to 1.2 mEqL or 50 gmL to 125 gmL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. Adolescents The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) was established in a 3week, doubleblind, placebocontrolled, randomized trial of adolescent inpatients and outpatients who met the diagnostic criteria for manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (with or without psychotic features) according to the DSMIVTR (n161). Diagnosis was confirmed by the KSADSPL. Acute Monotherapy  The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in this trial was the Adolescent Structured YoungMania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score. In this flexibledose trial, olanzapine 2.5 to 20 mgday (mean modal dose 10.7 mgday, mean dose of 8.9 mgday) was more effective than placebo in the treatment of adolescents with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, as supported by the statistically significantly greater mean reduction in YMRS total score for patients in the olanzapine treatment group than in the placebo group. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with olanzapine should be maintained, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. It is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Use in Specific Populations section of the package insert for Symbyax. Pregnancy Olanzapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. ( ) 8.1 Nursing Mothers Breast feeding is not recommended. ( ) 8.3 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine in children 13 years of age have not been established. ( ) 8.4 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C  In oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 18 mgkgday and in rabbits at doses up to 30 mgkgday (9 and 30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis, respectively) no evidence of teratogenicity was observed. In an oral rat teratology study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose of 18 mgkgday (9 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). Gestation was prolonged at 10 mgkgday (5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). In an oral rabbit teratology study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of 30 mgkgday (30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 2 2 2 2 Placental transfer of olanzapine occurs in rat pups. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials with olanzapine in pregnant females. Seven pregnancies were observed during clinical trials with olanzapine, including 2 resulting in normal births, 1 resulting in neonatal death due to a cardiovascular defect, 3 therapeutic abortions, and 1 spontaneous abortion. NonTeratogenic Effects  Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including olanzapine), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Olanzapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of olanzapine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Parturition in rats was not affected by olanzapine. 8.3 Nursing Mothers In a study in lactating, healthy women, olanzapine was excreted in breast milk. Mean infant dose at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose. It is recommended that women receiving olanzapine should not breastfeed. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of oral olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder were established in shortterm studies in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years). Use of olanzapine in adolescents is supported by evidence from adequate and wellcontrolled studies of olanzapine in which 268 adolescents received olanzapine in a range of 2.5 to 20 mgday see . Recommended starting dose for adolescents is lower than that for adults see . Compared to patients from adult clinical trials, adolescents were likely to gain more weight, experience increased sedation, and have greater increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, prolactin and hepatic aminotransferase levels see . When deciding among the alternative treatments available for adolescents, clinicians should consider the increased potential (in adolescents as compared with adults) for weight gain and hyperlipidemia. Clinicians should consider the potential longterm risks when prescribing to adolescents, and in many cases this may lead them to consider prescribing other drugs first in adolescents see .

<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY template 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis  Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to mice in two 78week studies at doses of 3, 10, 3020 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.85 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) and 0.25, 2, 8 mgkgday (equivalent to 0.062 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). Rats were dosed for 2 years at doses of 0.25, 1, 2.5, 4 mgkgday (males) and 0.25, 1, 4, 8 mgkgday (females) (equivalent to 0.132 and 0.134 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis, respectively). The incidence of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas was significantly increased in 1 mouse study in female mice dosed at 8 mgkgday (2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). These tumors were not increased in another mouse study in females dosed at 10 or 3020 mgkgday (25 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) in this study, there was a high incidence of early mortalities in males of the 3020 mgkgday group. The incidence of mammary gland adenomas and adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female mice dosed at 2 mgkgday and in female rats dosed at 4 mgkgday (0.5 and 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine elevated serum prolactin levels up to 4fold in rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in mammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin mediated. The relevance for human risk of the finding of prolactin mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown see . 2 2 2 2 2 2 Warnings and Precautions (5.15) Mutagenesis  No evidence of genotoxic potential for olanzapine was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, micronucleus test in mice, the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes, induction of forward mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells, or sister chromatid exchange test in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters. in vivo in vivo Impairment of Fertility  In an oral fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, male mating performance, but not fertility, was impaired at a dose of 22.4 mgkgday and female fertility was decreased at a dose of 3 mgkgday (11 and 1.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis, respectively). Discontinuance of olanzapine treatment reversed the effects on male mating performance. In female rats, the precoital period was increased and the mating index reduced at 5 mgkgday (2.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis). Diestrous was prolonged and estrous delayed at 1.1 mgkgday (0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) therefore olanzapine may produce a delay in ovulation. 2 2 2 13.2 Animal Pharmacology andor Toxicology In animal studies with olanzapine, the principal hematologic findings were reversible peripheral cytopenias in individual dogs dosed at 10 mgkg (17 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis), doserelated decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils in mice, and lymphopenia in rats. A few dogs treated with 10 mgkg developed reversible neutropenia andor reversible hemolytic anemia between 1 and 10 months of treatment. Doserelated decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils were seen in mice given doses of 10 mgkg (equal to 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) in studies of 3 months duration. Nonspecific lymphopenia, consistent with decreased body weight gain, occurred in rats receiving 22.5 mgkg (11 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) for 3 months or 16 mgkg (8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) for 6 or 12 months. No evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found in any of the species examined. Bone marrows were normocellular or hypercellular, indicating that the reductions in circulating blood cells were probably due to peripheral (nonmarrow) factors. 2 2 2 2</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>BOXED WARNING WARNING INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIARELATED PSYCHOSIS Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis. See Warnings and Precautions (5.1), 5.14) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2). When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Boxed Warning section of the package insert for Symbyax.

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE template 10.1 Human Experience In premarketing trials involving more than 3100 patients andor normal subjects, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of olanzapine was identified in 67 patients. In the patient taking the largest identified amount, 300 mg, the only symptoms reported were drowsiness and slurred speech. In the limited number of patients who were evaluated in hospitals, including the patient taking 300 mg, there were no observations indicating an adverse change in laboratory analytes or ECG. Vital signs were usually within normal limits following overdoses. In postmarketing reports of overdose with olanzapine alone, symptoms have been reported in the majority of cases. In symptomatic patients, symptoms with 10 incidence included agitationaggressiveness, dysarthria, tachycardia, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma. Among less commonly reported symptoms were the following potentially medically serious reactions aspiration, cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiac arrhythmias (such as supraventricular tachycardia and 1 patient experiencing sinus pause with spontaneous resumption of normal rhythm), delirium, possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depressionarrest, convulsion, hypertension, and hypotension. Reports of fatality in association with overdose of olanzapine alone have been received In 1 case of death, the amount of acutely ingested olanzapine was reported to be possibly as low as 450 mg of oral olanzapine however, in another case, a patient was reported to survive an acute olanzapine ingestion of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine. . 10.2 Management of Overdose For current information on the management of olanzapine overdose, contact a certified poison control center. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, which may include intubation. Gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the C and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose. max The possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. There is no specific antidote to olanzapine. Therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be initiated. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids andor sympathomimetic agents. (Do not use epinephrine, dopamine, or other sympathomimetics with betaagonist activity, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of olanzapineinduced alpha blockade.) Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. For specific information about overdosage with lithium or valproate, refer to the Overdosage section of the package inserts for these products. For specific information about overdosage with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, refer to the Overdosage section of the Symbyax package insert.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics Olanzapine binds with high affinity to the following receptors serotonin 5HT , 5HT (K 4, 11, and 5 nM, respectively), dopamine D (K 1131 nM), histamine H (K 7 nM), and adrenergic  receptors (K 19 nM). Olanzapine is an antagonist with moderate affinity binding for serotonin 5HT (K 57 nM) and muscarinic M (K 73, 96, 132, 32, and 48 nM, respectively). Olanzapine binds weakly to GABA , BZD, and  adrenergic receptors (K 10 M). 2A2C 6 i 14 i 1 i 1 i 3 i 15 i A i Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of olanzapine. Olanzapines antagonism of muscarinic M receptors may explain its anticholinergiclike effects. Olanzapines antagonism of histamine H receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Olanzapines antagonism of adrenergic  receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. 2 15 1 1</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dependence</i>:</td><td>9.3 Dependence In studies prospectively designed to assess abuse and dependence potential, olanzapine was shown to have acute depressive CNS effects but little or no potential of abuse or physical dependence in rats administered oral doses up to 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (20 mg) and rhesus monkeys administered oral doses up to 8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis. 2 Olanzapine has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drugseeking behavior, these observations were not systematic, and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNSactive drug will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of olanzapine (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drugseeking behavior).</td></tr>

( ) Laboratory Tests 5.17 5.1 Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Increased Mortality Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions , and Patient Counseling Information (5.14) (17.2) . In placebocontrolled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapinetreated patients was significantly greater than placebotreated patients (3.5 vs 1.5, respectively). Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis. In placebocontrolled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see . Boxed Warning and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) 5.2 Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and in bipolar I disorder, and close supervision of highrisk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for olanzapine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. 5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. see . Patient Counseling Information (17.3) 5.4 Hyperglycemia Physicians should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100 to 126 mgdL, nonfasting 140 to 200 mgdL). Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients starting treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. see . Patient Counseling Information (17.4) Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatmentemergent hyperglycemiarelated adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics. Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mgdL. In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mgdL. Placebotreated subjects (N19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mgdL. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults In an analysis of 5 placebocontrolled adult olanzapine monotherapy studies with a median treatment duration of approximately 3 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76 mgdL versus 0.17 mgdL). The difference in mean changes between olanzapine and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with antidiabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level 200 mgdL, andor a baseline fasting glucose level 126 mgdL). Olanzapinetreated patients had a greater mean HbA1c increase from baseline of 0.04 (median exposure 21 days), compared to a mean HbA1c decrease of 0.06 in placebotreated subjects (median exposure 17 days). In an analysis of 8 placebocontrolled studies (median treatment exposure 45 weeks), 6.1 of olanzapinetreated subjects (N855) had treatmentemergent glycosuria compared to 2.8 of placebotreated subjects (N599). Table 2 shows shortterm and longterm changes in fasting glucose levels from adult olanzapine monotherapy studies.

In analyses of patients who completed 912 months of olanzapine therapy, mean change in fasting and nonfasting glucose levels continued to increase over time. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescent patients, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change from baseline in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.68 mgdL versus 2.59 mgdL). The mean change in fasting glucose for adolescents exposed at least 24 weeks was 3.1 mgdL (N121). Table 3 shows shortterm and longterm changes in fasting blood glucose from adolescent olanzapine monotherapy studies.

Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic followup lipid evaluations in patients using olanzapine, is recommended.. see . Patient Counseling Information (17.5) Clinically significant, and sometimes very high (500 mgdL), elevations in triglyceride levels have been observed with olanzapine use. Modest mean increases in total cholesterol have also been seen with olanzapine use. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults In an analysis of 5 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapinetreated patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.3 mgdL, 3.0 mgdL, and 20.8 mgdL respectively compared to decreases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 6.1 mgdL, 4.3 mgdL, and 10.7 mgdL for placebotreated patients. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapinetreated patients and placebotreated patients. Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline, where lipid dysregulation was defined as patients diagnosed with dyslipidemia or related adverse reactions, patients treated with lipid lowering agents, or patients with high baseline lipid levels. In longterm studies (at least 48 weeks), patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.6 mgdL, 2.5 mgdL, and 18.7 mgdL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 0.16 mgdL. In an analysis of patients who completed 12 months of therapy, the mean nonfasting total cholesterol did not increase further after approximately 46 months. The proportion of patients who had changes (at least once) in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides from normal or borderline to high, or changes in HDL cholesterol from normal or borderline to low, was greater in longterm studies (at least 48 weeks) as compared with shortterm studies.

Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescents, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapinetreated adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 12.9 mgdL, 6.5 mgdL, and 28.4 mgdL, respectively, compared to increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol of 1.3 mgdL and 1.0 mgdL, and a decrease in triglycerides of 1.1 mgdL for placebotreated adolescents. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapinetreated adolescents and placebotreated adolescents. In longterm studies (at least 24 weeks), adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.5 mgdL, 5.4 mgdL, and 20.5 mgdL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 4.5 mgdL.

Patients receiving olanzapine should receive regular monitoring of weight.see  Patient Counseling Information (17.6) Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults In an analysis of 13 placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies, olanzapinetreated patients gained an average of 2.6 kg (5.7 lb), compared to an average 0.3 kg (0.6 lb) weight loss in placebotreated patients with a median exposure of 6 weeks 22.2 of olanzapinetreated patients gained at least 7 of their baseline weight, compared to 3 of placebotreated patients, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks 4.2 of olanzapinetreated patients gained at least 15 of their baseline weight, compared to 0.3 of placebotreated patients, with a median exposure to event of 12 weeks. Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.2 of olanzapinetreated patients and in 0 of placebotreated patients. In longterm studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) (median exposure of 573 days, N2021). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7, 15, or 25 of their baseline body weight with longterm exposure were 64, 32, and 12, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4 of olanzapinetreated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure. Table 6 includes data on adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified.

Mean increase in weight in adolescents was greater than in adults. In 4 placebocontrolled trials, discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 1 of olanzapinetreated patients, compared to 0 of placebotreated patients.

The percentages of adolescents who gained at least 7, 15, or 25 of their baseline body weight with longterm exposure were 89, 55, and 29, respectively. Among adolescent patients, mean weight gain by baseline BMI category was 11.5 kg (25.3 lb), 12.1 kg (26.6 lb), and 12.7 kg (27.9 lb), respectively, for normal (N106), <b style='color:red'>overweight</b> (N26) and obese (N17). Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.2 of olanzapinetreated patients following at least 24 weeks of exposure. Table 8 shows data on adolescent weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 6 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified. Little clinical trial data is available on weight gain in adolescents with olanzapine beyond 6 months of treatment.

Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, olanzapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with olanzapine despite the presence of the syndrome. For specific information about the warnings of lithium or valproate, refer to the Warnings section of the package inserts for these other products. 5.8 Orthostatic Hypotension Olanzapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dosetitration period, probably reflecting its  adrenergic antagonistic properties. see  1 Patient Counseling Information (17.6) For oral olanzapine therapy, the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by initiating therapy with 5 mg QD see . A more gradual titration to the target dose should be considered if hypotension occurs. Dosage and Administration (2) Syncope was reported in 0.6 (152500) of olanzapinetreated patients in phase 23 oral olanzapine studies. The risk for this sequence of hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus pause may be greater in nonpsychiatric patients compared to psychiatric patients who are possibly more adapted to certain effects of psychotropic drugs. Olanzapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) where the occurrence of syncope, or hypotension andor bradycardia might put the patient at increased medical risk. Caution is necessary in patients who receive treatment with other drugs having effects that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression see . Drug Interactions (7) 5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis Class Effect In clinical trial andor postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including olanzapine. Agranulocytosis has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of olanzapine should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm ) should discontinue olanzapine and have their WBC followed until recovery. 3 5.10 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimers disease. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimers disease. 5.11 Seizures During premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0.9 (222500) of olanzapinetreated patients. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimers dementia. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimers disease. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.12 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction associated with olanzapine treatment, occurring at an incidence of 26 in olanzapine patients compared to 15 in placebo patients. This adverse reaction was also dose related. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.4 (92500) of patients in the premarketing database. Since olanzapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that olanzapine therapy does not affect them adversely. see . Patient Counseling Information (17.8) 5.13 Body Temperature Regulation Disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing olanzapine for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration. see . Patient Counseling Information (17.9) 5.14 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited see . Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Olanzapine exhibits muscarinic receptor affinity. In premarketing clinical trials with olanzapine, olanzapine was associated with constipation, dry mouth, and tachycardia, all adverse reactions possibly related to cholinergic antagonism. Such adverse reactions were not often the basis for discontinuations from olanzapine, but olanzapine should be used with caution in patients with clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, narrow angle glaucoma, or a history of paralytic ileus or related conditions. in vitro In 5 placebocontrolled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis (n1184), the following treatmentemergent adverse reactions were reported in olanzapinetreated patients at an incidence of at least 2 and significantly greater than placebotreated patients falls, somnolence, peripheral edema, abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, lethargy, increased weight, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, dry mouth and visual hallucinations. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was greater with olanzapine than placebo (13 vs 7). Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see )and . Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 Patient Counseling Information (17.2) Olanzapine has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Because of the risk of orthostatic hypotension with olanzapine, caution should be observed in cardiac patients see . Warnings and Precautions (5.8) 5.15 Hyperprolactinemia As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D receptors, olanzapine elevates prolactin levels, and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactinelevating compounds. Longstanding hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. 2 Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats see . Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. in vitro Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) In placebocontrolled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 30 of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5 of adults treated with placebo. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 8136 adults treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrualrelated events (2 493240 of females), sexual functionrelated events (2 1508136 of females and males), and breastrelated events (0.7 233240 of females, 0.2 94896 of males). 1 2 3 In placebocontrolled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescent patients (up to 6 weeks) with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 47 of olanzapinetreated patients compared to 7 of placebotreated patients. In a pooled analysis from clinical trials including 454 adolescents treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrualrelated events (1 2168 of females), sexual functionrelated events (0.7 3454 of females and males), and breastrelated events (2 3168 of females, 2 7286 of males) see . 1 2 3 Use in Specific Populations (8.4) Based on a search of the following terms amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, menstruation delayed, and oligomenorrhea. 1 Based on a search of the following terms anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, loss of libido, abnormal orgasm, and sexual dysfunction. 2 Based on a search of the following terms breast discharge, enlargement or swelling, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and lactation disorder. 3 5.16 Use in Combination with Fluoxetine, Lithium, or Valproate When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert for Symbyax. When using olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, the prescriber should refer to the Warnings and Precautions sections of the package inserts for lithium or valproate. See .

<tr><td><i>animal_pharmacology_and_or_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13.2 Animal Pharmacology andor Toxicology In animal studies with olanzapine, the principal hematologic findings were reversible peripheral cytopenias in individual dogs dosed at 10 mgkg (17 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis), doserelated decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils in mice, and lymphopenia in rats. A few dogs treated with 10 mgkg developed reversible neutropenia andor reversible hemolytic anemia between 1 and 10 months of treatment. Doserelated decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils were seen in mice given doses of 10 mgkg (equal to 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) in studies of 3 months duration. Nonspecific lymphopenia, consistent with decreased body weight gain, occurred in rats receiving 22.5 mgkg (11 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) for 3 months or 16 mgkg (8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mgm basis) for 6 or 12 months. No evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found in any of the species examined. Bone marrows were normocellular or hypercellular, indicating that the reductions in circulating blood cells were probably due to peripheral (nonmarrow) factors. 2 2 2 2</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice and in SpragueDawley (SD) and F344 rats. Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1 mgkgday, 3 mgkgday, 10 mgkgday, and 30 mgkgday to ICR mice and 1 mgkgday, 3 mgkgday, and 10 mgkgday to F344 rats (0.2 times to 5 times and 0.3 times to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD based on mgm2, respectively). In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10 mgkgday, 20 mgkgday, 40 mgkgday, and 60 mgkgday (3 times to 19 times the MRHD based on mgm2). Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or rats. In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 mgkgday to 30 mgkgday (0.1 times to 0.9 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 0.5 times to 5 times the MRHD based on mgm2). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mgkgday (0.1 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 3 times the MRHD based on mgm2) and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomascarcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mgkgday (14 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 19 times the MRHD based on mgm2). Proliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary gland of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered prolactinmediated. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4week and 13week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactinmediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown. Mutagenesis The mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the in vitro bacterial reversemutation assay, the in vitro bacterial DNA repair assay, the in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3DCPP) were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3DCPP, produced increases in numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice however, the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans. Impairment of Fertility Female rats were treated with oral doses of 2 mgkgday, 6 mgkgday, and 20 mgkgday (0.6 times, 2 times, and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD on a mgm2 basis) of aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through day 7 of gestation. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased preimplantation loss was seen at 6 mgkg and 20 mgkg and decreased fetal weight was seen at 20 mgkg. Male rats were treated with oral doses of 20 mgkgday, 40 mgkgday, and 60 mgkgday (6 times, 13 times, and 19 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) of aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating. Disturbances in spermatogenesis were seen at 60 mgkg and prostate atrophy was seen at 40 mgkg and 60 mgkg, but no impairment of fertility was seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C In animal studies, aripiprazole demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats were treated with oral doses of 3 mgkgday, 10 mgkgday, and 30 mgkgday (1 times, 3 times, and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD on a mgm2 basis) of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Gestation was slightly prolonged at 30 mgkg. Treatment caused a slight delay in fetal development, as evidenced by decreased fetal weight (30 mgkg), undescended testes (30 mgkg), and delayed skeletal ossification (10 mgkg and 30 mgkg). There were no adverse effects on embryofetal or pup survival. Delivered offspring had decreased body weights (10 mgkg and 30 mgkg), and increased incidences of hepatodiaphragmatic nodules and diaphragmatic hernia at 30 mgkg (the other dose groups were not examined for these findings). A low incidence of diaphragmatic hernia was also seen in the fetuses exposed to 30 mgkg. Postnatally, delayed vaginal opening was seen at 10 mgkg and 30 mgkg and impaired reproductive performance (decreased fertility rate, corpora lutea, implants, live fetuses, and increased postimplantation loss, likely mediated through effects on female offspring) was seen at 30 mgkg. Some maternal toxicity was seen at 30 mgkg however, there was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity. In pregnant rats receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously (3 mgkgday, 9 mgkgday, and 27 mgkgday) during the period of organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and delayed skeletal ossification were seen at the highest dose, which also caused some maternal toxicity. Pregnant rabbits were treated with oral doses of 10 mgkgday, 30 mgkgday, and 100 mgkgday (2 times, 3 times, and 11 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 6 times, 19 times, and 65 times the MRHD based on mgm2) of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Decreased maternal food consumption and increased abortions were seen at 100 mgkg. Treatment caused increased fetal mortality (100 mgkg), decreased fetal weight (30 mgkg and 100 mgkg), increased incidence of a skeletal abnormality (fused sternebrae at 30 mgkg and 100 mgkg), and minor skeletal variations (100 mgkg). In pregnant rabbits receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously (3 mgkgday, 10 mgkgday, and 30 mgkgday) during the period of organogenesis, the highest dose, which caused pronounced maternal toxicity, resulted in decreased fetal weight, increased fetal abnormalities (primarily skeletal), and decreased fetal skeletal ossification. The fetal noeffect dose was 10 mgkg, which produced 5 times the human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC and is 6 times the MRHD based on mgm2. In a study in which rats were treated with oral doses of 3 mgkgday, 10 mgkgday, and 30 mgkgday (1 times, 3 times, and 10 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) of aripiprazole perinatally and postnatally (from day 17 of gestation through day 21 postpartum), slight maternal toxicity and slightly prolonged gestation were seen at 30 mgkg. An increase in stillbirths and decreases in pup weight (persisting into adulthood) and survival were seen at this dose. In rats receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously (3 mgkgday, 8 mgkgday, and 20 mgkgday) from day 6 of gestation through day 20 postpartum, an increase in stillbirths was seen at 8 mgkg and 20 mgkg, and decreases in early postnatal pup weights and survival were seen at 20 mgkg. These doses produced some maternal toxicity. There were no effects on postnatal behavioral and reproductive development. Nonteratogenic Effects There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. It is not known whether aripiprazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Aripiprazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics ABILIFY activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D2 receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40 of the parent drug exposure in plasma. The mean elimination halflives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole, respectively. Steadystate concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from singledose pharmacokinetics. At steadystate, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole are doseproportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that ABILIFY DISCMELT Orally Disintegrating Tablets are bioequivalent to ABILIFY Tablets.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when ABILIFY is taken in combination with other centrallyacting drugs or alcohol. Due to its alpha adrenergic antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents. Strong CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, fluoxetine) inhibitors will increase ABILIFY drug concentrations reduce ABILIFY dose to onehalf of the usual dose when used concomitantly (2.6, 7.1), except when used as adjunctive treatment with antidepressants (2.6). If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and strong CYP2D6 inhibitor are coadministered or a known CYP2D6 poor metabolizer is receiving a concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the ABILIFY dose should be reduced to onequarter (25) of the usual dose (2.6, 12.3). CYP3A4 inducers (eg, carbamazepine) will decrease ABILIFY drug concentrations double ABILIFY dose when used concomitantly (2.6, 7.1) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect ABILIFY Aripiprazole is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1 enzymes. Aripiprazole also does not undergo direct glucuronidation. This suggests that an interaction of aripiprazole with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, or other factors, like smoking, is unlikely. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for aripiprazole metabolism. Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, carbamazepine) could cause an increase in aripiprazole clearance and lower blood levels. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, quinidine, fluoxetine, or paroxetine) can inhibit aripiprazole elimination and cause increased blood levels. Ketoconazole and Other CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mgday for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63 and 77, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mgday) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to onehalf of its normal dose. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (itraconazole) would be expected to have similar effects and need similar dose reductions moderate inhibitors (erythromycin, grapefruit juice) have not been studied. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased. Quinidine and Other CYP2D6 Inhibitors Coadministration of a 10 mg single dose of aripiprazole with quinidine (166 mgday for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112 but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, by 35. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to onehalf of its normal dose when quinidine is given concomitantly with aripiprazole. Other significant inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine or paroxetine, would be expected to have similar effects and should lead to similar dose reductions. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased. When adjunctive ABILIFY is administered to patients with major depressive disorder, ABILIFY should be administered without dosage adjustment as specified in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) . Carbamazepine and Other CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of carbamazepine (200 mg twice daily), a potent CYP3A4 inducer, with aripiprazole (30 mgday) resulted in an approximate 70 decrease in Cmax and AUC values of both aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole. When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. When carbamazepine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced. 7.2 Potential for ABILIFY to Affect Other Drugs Aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. In in vivo studies, 10 mgday to 30 mgday doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on metabolism by CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole, warfarin), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan) substrates. Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2mediated metabolism in vitro. No effect of aripiprazole was seen on the pharmacokinetics of lithium or valproate. Alcohol There was no significant difference between aripiprazole coadministered with ethanol and placebo coadministered with ethanol on performance of gross motor skills or stimulus response in healthy subjects. As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking ABILIFY. 7.3 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with ABILIFY Famotidine Coadministration of aripiprazole (given in a single dose of 15 mg) with a 40 mg single dose of the H2 antagonist famotidine, a potent gastric acid blocker, decreased the solubility of aripiprazole and, hence, its rate of absorption, reducing by 37 and 21 the Cmax of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole, respectively, and by 13 and 15, respectively, the extent of absorption (AUC). No dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with famotidine. Valproate When valproate (500 mgday1500 mgday) and aripiprazole (30 mgday) were coadministered, at steadystate the Cmax and AUC of aripiprazole were decreased by 25. No dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with valproate. When aripiprazole (30 mgday) and valproate (1000 mgday) were coadministered, at steadystate there were no clinically significant changes in the Cmax or AUC of valproate. No dosage adjustment of valproate is required when administered concomitantly with aripiprazole. Lithium A pharmacokinetic interaction of aripiprazole with lithium is unlikely because lithium is not bound to plasma proteins, is not metabolized, and is almost entirely excreted unchanged in urine. Coadministration of therapeutic doses of lithium (1200 mgday1800 mgday) for 21 days with aripiprazole (30 mgday) did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole or its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole (Cmax and AUC increased by less than 20). No dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with lithium. Coadministration of aripiprazole (30 mgday) with lithium (900 mgday) did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of lithium. No dosage adjustment of lithium is required when administered concomitantly with aripiprazole. Lamotrigine Coadministration of 10 mgday to 30 mgday oral doses of aripiprazole for 14 days to patients with bipolar I disorder had no effect on the steadystate pharmacokinetics of 100 mgday to 400 mgday lamotrigine, a UDPglucuronosyltransferase 1A4 substrate. No dosage adjustment of lamotrigine is required when aripiprazole is added to lamotrigine. Dextromethorphan Aripiprazole at doses of 10 mgday to 30 mgday for 14 days had no effect on dextromethorphans Odealkylation to its major metabolite, dextrorphan, a pathway dependent on CYP2D6 activity. Aripiprazole also had no effect on dextromethorphans Ndemethylation to its metabolite 3methoxymorphinan, a pathway dependent on CYP3A4 activity. No dosage adjustment of dextromethorphan is required when administered concomitantly with aripiprazole. Warfarin Aripiprazole 10 mgday for 14 days had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Rwarfarin and Swarfarin or on the pharmacodynamic end point of International Normalized Ratio, indicating the lack of a clinically relevant effect of aripiprazole on CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 metabolism or the binding of highly proteinbound warfarin. No dosage adjustment of warfarin is required when administered concomitantly with aripiprazole. Omeprazole Aripiprazole 10 mgday for 15 days had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 20 mg dose of omeprazole, a CYP2C19 substrate, in healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment of omeprazole is required when administered concomitantly with aripiprazole. Lorazepam Coadministration of lorazepam injection (2 mg) and aripiprazole injection (15 mg) to healthy subjects (n40 35 males and 5 females ages 1945 years old) did not result in clinically important changes in the pharmacokinetics of either drug. No dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with lorazepam. However, the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone and the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6). Escitalopram Coadministration of 10 mgday oral doses of aripiprazole for 14 days to healthy subjects had no effect on the steadystate pharmacokinetics of 10 mgday escitalopram, a substrate of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. No dosage adjustment of escitalopram is required when aripiprazole is added to escitalopram. Venlafaxine Coadministration of 10 mgday to 20 mgday oral doses of aripiprazole for 14 days to healthy subjects had no effect on the steadystate pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine and Odesmethylvenlafaxine following 75 mgday venlafaxine XR, a CYP2D6 substrate. No dosage adjustment of venlafaxine is required when aripiprazole is added to venlafaxine. Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, and Sertraline A population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with major depressive disorder showed no substantial change in plasma concentrations of fluoxetine (20 mgday or 40 mgday), paroxetine CR (37.5 mgday or 50 mgday), or sertraline (100 mgday or 150 mgday) dosed to steadystate. The steadystate plasma concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine increased by about 18 and 36, respectively, and concentrations of paroxetine decreased by about 27. The steadystate plasma concentrations of sertraline and desmethylsertraline were not substantially changed when these antidepressant therapies were coadministered with aripiprazole. Aripiprazole dosing was 2 mgday to 15 mgday (when given with fluoxetine or paroxetine) or 2 mgday to 20 mgday (when given with sertraline).</td></tr>

The efficacy of ABILIFY was established in four 46 week trials in adults and one 6week trial in adolescents (13 to 17 years). Maintenance efficacy was demonstrated in one trial in adults and can be extrapolated to adolescents see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1). 1.2 Bipolar I Disorder Acute Treatment of Manic and Mixed Episodes ABILIFY is indicated for the acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or valproate. Efficacy as monotherapy was established in four 3week monotherapy trials in adults and one 4week monotherapy trial in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years). Efficacy as adjunctive therapy was established in one 6week adjunctive trial in adults see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2). Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder ABILIFY is indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to either lithium or valproate. Maintenance efficacy was demonstrated in one monotherapy maintenance trial and in one adjunctive maintenance trial in adults see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2). 1.3 Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder ABILIFY is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Efficacy was established in two 6week trials in adults with MDD who had an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy during the current episode see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.3). 1.4 Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder. Efficacy was established in two 8week trials in pediatric patients (aged 6 to 17 years) with irritability associated with autistic disorder (including symptoms of aggression towards others, deliberate selfinjuriousness, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods) see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4). 1.5 Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania ABILIFY Injection is indicated for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, manic or mixed. Psychomotor agitation is defined in DSMIV as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension. Patients experiencing agitation often manifest behaviors that interfere with their diagnosis and care (eg, threatening behaviors, escalating or urgently distressing behavior, or selfexhausting behavior), leading clinicians to the use of intramuscular antipsychotic medications to achieve immediate control of the agitation. Efficacy was established in three shortterm (24hour) trials in adults see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.5). 1.6 Special Considerations in Treating Pediatric Schizophrenia, Bipolar I Disorder, and Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder Psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents are often serious mental disorders with variable symptom profiles that are not always congruent with adult diagnostic criteria. It is recommended that psychotropic medication therapy for pediatric patients only be initiated after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been conducted and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for pediatric patients with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and irritability associated with autistic disorder is indicated as part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational, and social interventions.</td></tr>

The most common adverse reactions in the pediatric clinical trials (10) were somnolence, headache, vomiting, extrapyramidal disorder, fatigue, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and weight increased. Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 13,543 adult patients who participated in multipledose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Dementia of the Alzheimers type, Parkinsons disease, and alcoholism, and who had approximately 7619 patientyears of exposure to oral aripiprazole and 749 patients with exposure to aripiprazole injection. A total of 3390 patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 1933 patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least 1 year of exposure. Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 920 patients (6 to 17 years) who participated in multipledose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, bipolar mania, or autistic disorder and who had approximately 517 patientyears of exposure to oral aripiprazole. A total of 465 pediatric patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 117 pediatric patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least 1 year of exposure. The conditions and duration of treatment with aripiprazole (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with antidepressants or mood stabilizers) included (in overlapping categories) doubleblind, comparative and noncomparative openlabel studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed and flexibledose studies, and short and longerterm exposure. Adverse events during exposure were obtained by collecting volunteered adverse events, as well as results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, and ECG. Adverse experiences were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. In the tables and tabulations that follow, MedDRA dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events into a smaller number of standardized event categories, in order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. There was no attempt to use investigator causality assessments ie, all events meeting the defined criteria, regardless of investigator causality are included. Throughout this section, adverse reactions are reported. These are adverse events that were considered to be reasonably associated with the use of ABILIFY (adverse drug reactions) based on the comprehensive assessment of the available adverse event information. A causal association for ABILIFY often cannot be reliably established in individual cases. The figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatment, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reaction incidence in the population studied. 6.2 Clinical Studies Experience Adult Patients with Schizophrenia The following findings are based on a pool of five placebocontrolled trials (four 4week and one 6week) in which oral aripiprazole was administered in doses ranging from 2 mgday to 30 mgday. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Overall, there was little difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions between aripiprazoletreated (7) and placebotreated (9) patients. The types of adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were similar for the aripiprazoletreated and placebotreated patients. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The only commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia (incidence of 5 or greater and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo) was akathisia (aripiprazole 8 placebo 4). Adult Patients with Bipolar Mania Monotherapy The following findings are based on a pool of 3week, placebocontrolled, bipolar mania trials in which oral aripiprazole was administered at doses of 15 mgday or 30 mgday. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Overall, in patients with bipolar mania, there was little difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions between aripiprazoletreated (11) and placebotreated (10) patients. The types of adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were similar between the aripiprazoletreated and placebotreated patients. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions Commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of aripiprazole in patients with bipolar mania (incidence of 5 or greater and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo) are shown in Table 5.

Adult Patients with Adjunctive Therapy with Bipolar Mania The following findings are based on a placebocontrolled trial of adult patients with bipolar disorder in which aripiprazole was administered at doses of 15 mgday or 30 mgday as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 12 for patients treated with adjunctive aripiprazole compared to 6 for patients treated with adjunctive placebo. The most common adverse drug reactions associated with discontinuation in the adjunctive aripiprazoletreated compared to placebotreated patients were akathisia (5 and 1, respectively) and tremor (2 and 1, respectively). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The commonly observed adverse reactions associated with adjunctive aripiprazole and lithium or valproate in patients with bipolar mania (incidence of 5 or greater and incidence at least twice that for adjunctive placebo) were akathisia, insomnia, and extrapyramidal disorder. Less Common Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with Adjunctive Therapy in Bipolar Mania Table 7 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute treatment (up to 6 weeks), including only those reactions that occurred in 2 or more of patients treated with adjunctive aripiprazole (doses of 15 mgday or 30 mgday) and lithium or valproate and for which the incidence in patients treated with this combination was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo plus lithium or valproate.

Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions Commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of aripiprazole in adolescent patients with schizophrenia (incidence of 5 or greater and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo) were extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor. Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years) with Bipolar Mania The following findings are based on one 4week, placebocontrolled trial in which oral aripiprazole was administered in doses of 10 mgday or 30 mgday. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions between aripiprazoletreated and placebotreated pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) was 7 and 2, respectively.

Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 6 for adjunctive aripiprazoletreated patients and 2 for adjunctive placebotreated patients. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of adjunctive aripiprazole in patients with major depressive disorder (incidence of 5 or greater and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo) were akathisia, restlessness, insomnia, constipation, fatigue, and blurred vision. Less Common Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Table 11 enumerates the pooled incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks), including only those adverse reactions that occurred in 2 or more of patients treated with adjunctive aripiprazole (doses 2 mgday) and for which the incidence in patients treated with adjunctive aripiprazole was greater than the incidence in patients treated with adjunctive placebo in the combined dataset.

Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Overall, in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, there was little difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions between aripiprazoletreated (0.8) and placebotreated (0.5) patients. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions There was one commonly observed adverse reaction (nausea) associated with the use of aripiprazole injection in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar mania (incidence of 5 or greater and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo). Less Common Adverse Reactions in Patients with Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania Table 12 enumerates the pooled incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (24hour), including only those adverse reactions that occurred in 2 or more of patients treated with aripiprazole injection (doses 5.25 mgday) and for which the incidence in patients treated with aripiprazole injection was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo in the combined dataset.

This analysis, stratified by study, indicated that the only adverse reaction to have a possible dose response relationship, and then most prominent only with 30 mg, was somnolence including sedation (incidences were placebo, 7.1 10 mg, 8.5 15 mg, 8.7 20 mg, 7.5 30 mg, 12.6). In the study of pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia, three common adverse reactions appeared to have a possible dose response relationship extrapyramidal disorder (incidences were placebo, 5.0 10 mg, 13.0 30 mg, 21.6) somnolence (incidences were placebo, 6.0 10 mg, 11.0 30 mg, 21.6) and tremor (incidences were placebo, 2.0 10 mg, 2.0 30 mg, 11.8). Bipolar Mania In the study of pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania, four common adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship at 4 weeks extrapyramidal disorder (incidences were placebo, 3.1 10 mg, 12.2 30 mg, 27.3) somnolence (incidences were placebo, 3.1 10 mg, 19.4 30 mg, 26.3) akathisia (incidences were placebo, 2.1 10 mg, 8.2 30 mg, 11.1) and salivary hypersecretion (incidences were placebo, 0 10 mg, 3.1 30 mg, 8.1). Autistic Disorder In a study of pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with autistic disorder, one common adverse reaction had a possible dose response relationship fatigue (incidences were placebo, 0 5 mg, 3.8 10 mg, 22.0 15 mg, 18.5). Extrapyramidal Symptoms Schizophrenia In shortterm, placebocontrolled trials in schizophrenia in adults, the incidence of reported EPSrelated events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazoletreated patients was 13 vs. 12 for placebo and the incidence of akathisiarelated events for aripiprazoletreated patients was 8 vs. 4 for placebo. In the shortterm, placebocontrolled trial of schizophrenia in pediatric (13 to 17 years) patients, the incidence of reported EPSrelated events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazoletreated patients was 25 vs. 7 for placebo and the incidence of akathisiarelated events for aripiprazoletreated patients was 9 vs. 6 for placebo. Objectively collected data from those trials was collected on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias). In the adult schizophrenia trials, the objectively collected data did not show a difference between aripiprazole and placebo, with the exception of the Barnes Akathisia Scale (aripiprazole, 0.08 placebo, 0.05). In the pediatric (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia trial, the objectively collected data did not show a difference between aripiprazole and placebo, with the exception of the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (aripiprazole, 0.24 placebo, 0.29). Similarly, in a longterm (26week), placebocontrolled trial of schizophrenia in adults, objectively collected data on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias) did not show a difference between aripiprazole and placebo. Bipolar Mania In the shortterm, placebocontrolled trials in bipolar mania in adults, the incidence of reported EPSrelated events, excluding events related to akathisia, for monotherapy aripiprazoletreated patients was 16 vs. 8 for placebo and the incidence of akathisiarelated events for monotherapy aripiprazoletreated patients was 13 vs. 4 for placebo. In the 6week, placebocontrolled trial in bipolar mania for adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate, the incidence of reported EPSrelated events, excluding events related to akathisia for adjunctive aripiprazoletreated patients was 15 vs. 8 for adjunctive placebo and the incidence of akathisiarelated events for adjunctive aripiprazoletreated patients was 19 vs. 5 for adjunctive placebo. In the shortterm, placebocontrolled trial in bipolar mania in pediatric (10 to 17 years) patients, the incidence of reported EPSrelated events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazoletreated patients was 26 vs. 5 for placebo and the incidence of akathisiarelated events for aripiprazoletreated patients was 10 vs. 2 for placebo. In the adult bipolar mania trials with monotherapy aripiprazole, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale showed a significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo (aripiprazole, 0.50 placebo, 0.01 and aripiprazole, 0.21 placebo, 0.05). Changes in the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the aripiprazole and placebo groups. In the bipolar mania trials with aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale showed a significant difference between adjunctive aripiprazole and adjunctive placebo (aripiprazole, 0.73 placebo, 0.07 and aripiprazole, 0.30 placebo, 0.11). Changes in the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for adjunctive aripiprazole and adjunctive placebo. In the pediatric (10 to 17 years) shortterm bipolar mania trial, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale showed a significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo (aripiprazole, 0.90 placebo, 0.05). Changes in the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the aripiprazole and placebo groups. Major Depressive Disorder In the shortterm, placebocontrolled trials in major depressive disorder, the incidence of reported EPSrelated events, excluding events related to akathisia, for adjunctive aripiprazoletreated patients was 8 vs. 5 for adjunctive placebotreated patients and the incidence of akathisiarelated events for adjunctive aripiprazoletreated patients was 25 vs. 4 for adjunctive placebotreated patients. In the major depressive disorder trials, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale showed a significant difference between adjunctive aripiprazole and adjunctive placebo (aripiprazole, 0.31 placebo, 0.03 and aripiprazole, 0.22 placebo, 0.02). Changes in the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the adjunctive aripiprazole and adjunctive placebo groups. Autistic Disorder In the shortterm, placebocontrolled trials in autistic disorder in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years), the incidence of reported EPSrelated events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazoletreated patients was 18 vs. 2 for placebo and the incidence of akathisiarelated events for aripiprazoletreated patients was 3 vs. 9 for placebo. In the pediatric (6 to 17 years) shortterm autistic disorder trials, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale showed a significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo (aripiprazole, 0.1 placebo, 0.4). Changes in the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the aripiprazole and placebo groups. Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania In the placebocontrolled trials in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, the incidence of reported EPSrelated events excluding events related to akathisia for aripiprazoletreated patients was 2 vs. 2 for placebo and the incidence of akathisiarelated events for aripiprazoletreated patients was 2 vs. 0 for placebo. Objectively collected data on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia) for all treatment groups did not show a difference between aripiprazole and placebo. Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Laboratory Test Abnormalities A between group comparison for 3week to 6week, placebocontrolled trials in adults or 4week to 8week, placebocontrolled trials in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) revealed no medically important differences between the aripiprazole and placebo groups in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis parameters. Similarly, there were no aripiprazoleplacebo differences in the incidence of discontinuations for changes in serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis in adult or pediatric patients. In the 6week trials of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder, there were no clinically important differences between the adjunctive aripiprazoletreated and adjunctive placebotreated patients in the median change from baseline in prolactin, fasting glucose, HDL, LDL, or total cholesterol measurements. The median  change from baseline in triglycerides was 5 for adjunctive aripiprazoletreated patients vs. 0 for adjunctive placebotreated patients. In a longterm (26week), placebocontrolled trial in schizophrenia, there were no medically important differences between the aripiprazole and placebo patients in the mean change from baseline in prolactin, fasting glucose, triglyceride, HDL, LDL, or total cholesterol measurements. A similar profile was observed in longterm clinical trials of patients with bipolar disorder. Weight Gain In 4week to 6 week trials in adults with schizophrenia, there was a slight difference in mean weight gain between aripiprazole and placebo patients (0.7 kg vs. 0.05 kg, respectively) and also a difference in the proportion of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7 of body weight aripiprazole (8) compared to placebo (3). In a 6week trial in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a slight difference in mean weight gain between aripiprazole and placebo patients (0.13 kg vs. 0.83 kg, respectively) and also a difference in the proportion of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7 of body weight aripiprazole (5) compared to placebo (1). In 3week trials in adults with mania with monotherapy aripiprazole, the mean weight gain for aripiprazole and placebo patients was 0.1 kg vs. 0.0 kg, respectively. The proportion of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7 of body weight was aripiprazole (2) compared to placebo (3). In the 6week trial in mania with aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate, the mean weight gain for aripiprazole and placebo patients was 0.6 kg vs. 0.2 kg, respectively. The proportion of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7 of body weight with adjunctive aripiprazole was 3 compared to adjunctive placebo 4. In the trials adding aripiprazole to antidepressants, patients first received 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment followed by 6 weeks of adjunctive aripiprazole or placebo in addition to their ongoing antidepressant treatment. The mean weight gain with adjunctive aripiprazole was 1.7 kg vs. 0.4 kg with adjunctive placebo. The proportion of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7 of body weight was 5 with adjunctive aripiprazole compared to 1 with adjunctive placebo. In the two shortterm, placebocontrolled trials in patients (6 to 17 years) with autistic disorder, the mean increase in body weight in the aripiprazole group was 1.6 kg vs. 0.4 kg in the placebo group. The proportion of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7 of body weight was 26 in aripiprazole group compared to 7 in placebo group. Table 13 provides the weight change results from a longterm (26week), placebocontrolled study of aripiprazole in adults with schizophrenia, both mean change from baseline and proportions of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of 7 of body weight relative to baseline, categorized by BMI at baseline. Although there was no mean weight increase, the aripiprazole group tended to show more patients with a 7 weight gain.

Aripiprazole was associated with a median increase in heart rate of 2 beats per minute compared to no increase among placebo patients. In the pooled, placebocontrolled trials in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, there were no significant differences between aripiprazole injection and placebo in the proportion of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, as measured by standard 12lead ECGs. Additional Findings Observed in Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions in LongTerm, DoubleBlind, PlaceboControlled Trials The adverse reactions reported in a 26week, doubleblind trial comparing oral ABILIFY and placebo in patients with schizophrenia were generally consistent with those reported in the shortterm, placebocontrolled trials, except for a higher incidence of tremor 8 (12153) for ABILIFY vs. 2 (3153) for placebo. In this study, the majority of the cases of tremor were of mild intensity (812 mild and 412 moderate), occurred early in therapy (912 49 days), and were of limited duration (712 10 days). Tremor infrequently led to discontinuation (1) of ABILIFY. In addition, in a longterm (52week), activecontrolled study, the incidence of tremor was 5 (40859) for ABILIFY. A similar profile was observed in a longterm monotherapy study and a longterm adjunctive study with lithium and valproate in bipolar disorder. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Aripiprazole Following is a list of MedDRA terms that reflect adverse reactions as defined in ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) reported by patients treated with oral aripiprazole at multiple doses 2 mgday during any phase of a trial within the database of 13,543 adult patients. All events assessed as possible adverse drug reactions have been included with the exception of more commonly occurring events. In addition, medicallyclinically meaningful adverse reactions, particularly those that are likely to be useful to the prescriber or that have pharmacologic plausibility, have been included. Events already listed in other parts of ADVERSE REACTIONS (6), or those considered in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5) or OVERDOSAGE (10) have been excluded.

However, such efficacy and lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between aripiprazole and lithium or valproate can be extrapolated from adult data, along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients demonstrating irritability associated with autistic disorder were established in two 8week, placebocontrolled clinical trials in 212 pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1.4) , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4) , ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2), and CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4). Maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See Medication Guide 17.1 Information for Patients Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe ABILIFY Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementiarelated psychoses treated with antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death. ABILIFY is not approved for elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1). Clinical Worsening of Depression and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a daytoday basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2). Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with ABILIFY and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide including information about Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions is available for ABILIFY. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. It should be noted that ABILIFY is not approved as a single agent for treatment of depression and has not been evaluated in pediatric major depressive disorder. Use of Orally Disintegrating Tablet Do not open the blister until ready to administer. For single tablet removal, open the package and peel back the foil on the blister to expose the tablet. Do not push the tablet through the foil because this could damage the tablet. Immediately upon opening the blister, using dry hands, remove the tablet and place the entire ABILIFY DISCMELT Orally Disintegrating Tablet on the tongue. Tablet disintegration occurs rapidly in saliva. It is recommended that ABILIFY DISCMELT be taken without liquid. However, if needed, it can be taken with liquid. Do not attempt to split the tablet. Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Because aripiprazole may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole therapy does not affect them adversely see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9). Pregnancy Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with ABILIFY see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1). Nursing Patients should be advised not to breastfeed an infant if they are taking ABILIFY see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.3). Concomitant Medication Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or overthecounter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7). Alcohol Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking ABILIFY see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2). Heat Exposure and Dehydration Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10).

Maximum daily dose 30 mg (2.5) 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults Dose Selection The recommended starting and target dose for ABILIFY is 10 mgday or 15 mgday administered on a onceaday schedule without regard to meals. ABILIFY has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 mgday to 30 mgday, when administered as the tablet formulation however, doses higher than 10 mgday or 15 mgday were not more effective than 10 mgday or 15 mgday. Dosage increases should generally not be made before 2 weeks, the time needed to achieve steadystate see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1). Maintenance Treatment Maintenance of efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a trial involving patients with schizophrenia who had been symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from those medications and randomized to either ABILIFY 15 mgday or placebo, and observed for relapse see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1). Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. Adolescents Dose Selection The recommended target dose of ABILIFY is 10 mgday. Aripiprazole was studied in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia at daily doses of 10 mg and 30 mg. The starting daily dose of the tablet formulation in these patients was 2 mg, which was titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after 2 additional days. Subsequent dose increases should be administered in 5 mg increments. The 30 mgday dose was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mgday dose. ABILIFY can be administered without regard to meals see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1). Maintenance Treatment The efficacy of ABILIFY for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in the adolescent population has not been evaluated. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with ABILIFY should be maintained on the drug, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. Thus, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Switching from Other Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from other antipsychotics to ABILIFY or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. 2.2 Bipolar I Disorder Acute Treatment of Manic and Mixed Episodes Adults The recommended starting dose in adults is 15 mg given once daily as monotherapy and 10 mg to 15 mg given once daily as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. ABILIFY can be given without regard to meals. The recommended target dose of ABILIFY is 15 mgday, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. The dose may be increased to 30 mgday based on clinical response. The safety of doses above 30 mgday has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Pediatrics The recommended starting dose in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) as monotherapy is 2 mgday, with titration to 5 mgday after 2 days, and a target dose of 10 mgday after 2 additional days. Recommended dosing as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate is the same. Subsequent dose increases, if needed, should be administered in 5 mgday increments. ABILIFY can be given without regard to meals see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2). Maintenance Treatment The recommended dose for maintenance treatment, whether as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy, is the same dose needed to stabilize patients during acute treatment, both for adult and pediatric patients. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2). 2.3 Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder Adults Dose Selection The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY as adjunctive treatment for patients already taking an antidepressant is 2 mgday to 5 mgday. The efficacy of ABILIFY as an adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder was established within a dose range of 2 mgday to 15 mgday. Dose adjustments of up to 5 mgday should occur gradually, at intervals of no less than 1 week see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.3). Maintenance Treatment The efficacy of ABILIFY for the adjunctive maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder has not been evaluated. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with ABILIFY should be maintained, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. 2.4 Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder Pediatric Patients Dose Selection The efficacy of aripiprazole has been established in the treatment of pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age with irritability associated with autistic disorder at doses of 5 mgday to 15 mgday. The dosage of ABILIFY should be individualized according to tolerability and response. Dosing should be initiated at 2 mgday. The dose should be increased to 5 mgday, with subsequent increases to 10 mgday or 15 mgday if needed. Dose adjustments of up to 5 mgday should occur gradually, at intervals of no less than 1 week see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4). Maintenance Treatment The efficacy of ABILIFY for the maintenance treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder has not been evaluated. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with ABILIFY should be maintained, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. 2.5 Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania (Intramuscular Injection) Adults Dose Selection The recommended dose in these patients is 9.75 mg. The effectiveness of aripiprazole injection in controlling agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar mania was demonstrated over a dose range of 5.25 mg to 15 mg. No additional benefit was demonstrated for 15 mg compared to 9.75 mg. A lower dose of 5.25 mg may be considered when clinical factors warrant. If agitation warranting a second dose persists following the initial dose, cumulative doses up to a total of 30 mgday may be given. However, the efficacy of repeated doses of aripiprazole injection in agitated patients has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The safety of total daily doses greater than 30 mg or injections given more frequently than every 2 hours have not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.5). If ongoing aripiprazole therapy is clinically indicated, oral aripiprazole in a range of 10 mgday to 30 mgday should replace aripiprazole injection as soon as possible see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1 and 2.2). Administration of ABILIFY Injection To administer ABILIFY Injection, draw up the required volume of solution into the syringe as shown in Table 1. Discard any unused portion. Table 1 ABILIFY Injection Dosing Recommendations SingleDose Required Volume of Solution 5.25 mg 0.7 mL 9.75 mg 1.3 mL 15 mg 2 mL ABILIFY Injection is intended for intramuscular use only. Do not administer intravenously or subcutaneously. Inject slowly, deep into the muscle mass. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Dosage adjustments in adults are not routinely indicated on the basis of age, gender, race, or renal or hepatic impairment status see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.48.10). Dosage adjustment for patients taking aripiprazole concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors When concomitant administration of aripiprazole with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or clarithromycin is indicated, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to onehalf of the usual dose. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be increased see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1). Dosage adjustment for patients taking aripiprazole concomitantly with potential CYP2D6 inhibitors When concomitant administration of potential CYP2D6 inhibitors such as quinidine, fluoxetine, or paroxetine with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced at least to onehalf of its normal dose. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be increased see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1). When adjunctive ABILIFY is administered to patients with major depressive disorder, ABILIFY should be administered without dosage adjustment as specified in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) . Dosing recommendation in patients taking aripiprazole concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors When concomitant administration of aripiprazole with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole or clarithromycin) and CYP2D6 (such as quinidine, fluoxetine, or paroxetine) is indicated, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to onequarter (25) of the usual dose. When the CYP3A4 andor CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1). Dosing recommendation in patients taking aripiprazole concomitantly with strong, moderate, or weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 Patients who may be receiving a combination of strong, moderate, and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (eg, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor or a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor with a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor), the dosing may be reduced to onequarter (25) of the usual dose initially and then adjusted to achieve a favorable clinical response. Dosing recommendation in patients who are classified as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) The aripiprazole dose in PM patients should initially be reduced to onehalf (50) of the usual dose and then adjusted to achieve a favorable clinical response. The dose of aripiprazole for PM patients who are administered a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor should be reduced to onequarter (25) of the usual dose see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3). Dosage adjustment for patients taking potential CYP3A4 inducers When a potential CYP3A4 inducer such as carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to 10 mg to 15 mg see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1). 2.7 Dosing of Oral Solution The oral solution can be substituted for tablets on a mgpermg basis up to the 25 mg dose level. Patients receiving 30 mg tablets should receive 25 mg of the solution see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3). 2.8 Dosing of Orally Disintegrating Tablets The dosing for ABILIFY Orally Disintegrating Tablets is the same as for the oral tablets see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4).</td></tr>

However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of aripiprazole is mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D2 and 5HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5HT2A receptors. Actions at receptors other than D2, 5HT1A, and 5HT2A may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole (eg, the orthostatic hypotension observed with aripiprazole may be explained by its antagonist activity at adrenergic alpha1 receptors).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of aripiprazole, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, irritability associated with autistic disorder, and agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of aripiprazole is mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D2 and 5HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5HT2A receptors. Actions at receptors other than D2, 5HT1A, and 5HT2A may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole (eg, the orthostatic hypotension observed with aripiprazole may be explained by its antagonist activity at adrenergic alpha1 receptors). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors (Ki values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2C and 5HT7, alpha1adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors (Ki values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC501000 nM). Aripiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and the serotonin 5HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at serotonin 5HT2A receptor. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics ABILIFY activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D2 receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40 of the parent drug exposure in plasma. The mean elimination halflives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole, respectively. Steadystate concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from singledose pharmacokinetics. At steadystate, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole are doseproportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that ABILIFY DISCMELT Orally Disintegrating Tablets are bioequivalent to ABILIFY Tablets. ORAL ADMINISTRATION Absorption Tablet Aripiprazole is well absorbed after administration of the tablet, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 hours to 5 hours the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87. ABILIFY can be administered with or without food. Administration of a 15 mg ABILIFY Tablet with a standard highfat meal did not significantly affect the Cmax or AUC of aripiprazole or its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, but delayed Tmax by 3 hours for aripiprazole and 12 hours for dehydroaripiprazole. Oral Solution Aripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole from the solution were higher than that from the tablet formulation. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects, the solution to tablet ratios of geometric mean Cmax and AUC values were 122 and 114, respectively see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.6). The singledose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and doseproportional between the doses of 5 mg to 30 mg. Distribution The steadystate volume of distribution of aripiprazole following intravenous administration is high (404 L or 4.9 Lkg), indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and its major metabolite are greater than 99 bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin. In healthy human volunteers administered 0.5 mgday to 30 mgday aripiprazole for 14 days, there was dosedependent D2 receptor occupancy indicating brain penetration of aripiprazole in humans. Metabolism and Elimination Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by three biotransformation pathways dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and Ndealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and Ndealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in the systemic circulation. At steadystate, dehydroaripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 of aripiprazole AUC in plasma. Approximately 8 of Caucasians and 38 of BlackAfrican Americans lack the capacity to metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as poor metabolizers (PM), whereas the rest are extensive metabolizers (EM). PMs have about an 80 increase in aripiprazole exposure and about a 30 decrease in exposure to the active metabolite compared to EMs, resulting in about a 60 higher exposure to the total active moieties from a given dose of aripiprazole compared to EMs. Coadministration of ABILIFY with known inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as quinidine or fluoxetine in EMs, approximately doubles aripiprazole plasma exposure, and dose adjustment is needed see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1). Similarly, PMs have higher exposure to aripiprazole compared to EMs hence, PMs should have their initial dose reduced by onehalf. Laboratory tests are available to identify CYP2D6 PMs. The mean elimination halflives are about 75 hours and 146 hours for aripiprazole in EMs and PMs, respectively. Aripiprazole does not inhibit or induce the CYP2D6 pathway. Following a single oral dose of 14Clabeled aripiprazole, approximately 25 and 55 of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1 of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces. INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION In two pharmacokinetic studies of aripiprazole injection administered intramuscularly to healthy subjects, the median times to the peak plasma concentrations were at 1 hour and 3 hours. A 5 mg intramuscular injection of aripiprazole had an absolute bioavailability of 100. The geometric mean maximum concentration achieved after an intramuscular dose was on average 19 higher than the Cmax of the oral tablet. While the systemic exposure over 24 hours was generally similar between aripiprazole injection given intramuscularly and after oral tablet administration, the aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramuscular injection was 90 greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet. In stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole after intramuscular administration were linear over a dose range of 1 mg to 45 mg. Although the metabolism of aripiprazole injection was not systematically evaluated, the intramuscular route of administration would not be expected to alter the metabolic pathways.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Schizophrenia Adults The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in five shortterm (4week and 6week), placebocontrolled trials of acutely relapsed inpatients who predominantly met DSMIIIIV criteria for schizophrenia. Four of the five trials were able to distinguish aripiprazole from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (one trial) or haloperidol (two trials), but they were not designed to allow for a comparison of ABILIFY and the active comparators. In the four positive trials for ABILIFY, four primary measures were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a multiitem inventory of general psychopathology used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The PANSS positive subscale is a subset of items in the PANSS that rates seven positive symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousnesspersecution, and hostility). The PANSS negative subscale is a subset of items in the PANSS that rates seven negative symptoms of schizophrenia (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive apathetic withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneityflow of conversation, stereotyped thinking). The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In a 4week trial (n414) comparing two fixed doses of ABILIFY (15 mgday or 30 mgday) to placebo, both doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, PANSS positive subscale, and CGIseverity score. In addition, the 15 mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale. In a 4week trial (n404) comparing two fixed doses of ABILIFY (20 mgday or 30 mgday) to placebo, both doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, and CGIseverity score. In a 6week trial (n420) comparing three fixed doses of ABILIFY (10 mgday, 15 mgday, or 20 mgday) to placebo, all three doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale. In a 6week trial (n367) comparing three fixed doses of ABILIFY (2 mgday, 5 mgday, or 10 mgday) to placebo, the 10 mg dose of ABILIFY was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, the primary outcome measure of the study. The 2 mg and 5 mg doses did not demonstrate superiority to placebo on the primary outcome measure. In a fifth study, a 4week trial (n103) comparing ABILIFY in a range of 5 mgday to 30 mgday to placebo, ABILIFY was only significantly different compared to placebo in a responder analysis based on the CGIseverity score, a primary outcome for that trial. Thus, the efficacy of 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg daily doses was established in two studies for each dose. Among these doses, there was no evidence that the higher dose groups offered any advantage over the lowest dose group of these studies. An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, gender, or race. A longerterm trial enrolled 310 inpatients or outpatients meeting DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia who were, by history, symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from their antipsychotic medications and randomized to ABILIFY 15 mgday or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse during the doubleblind phase was defined as CGIImprovement score of 5 (minimally worse), scores 5 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS, or 20 increase in the PANSS total score. Patients receiving ABILIFY 15 mgday experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 26 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. Pediatric Patients The efficacy of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) in the treatment of schizophrenia in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) was evaluated in one 6week, placebocontrolled trial of outpatients who met DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia and had a PANSS score 70 at baseline. In this trial (n302) comparing two fixed doses of ABILIFY (10 mgday or 30 mgday) to placebo, ABILIFY was titrated starting from 2 mgday to the target dose in 5 days in the 10 mgday treatment arm and in 11 days in the 30 mgday treatment arm. Both doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, the primary outcome measure of the study. The 30 mgday dosage was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mgday dose. Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. 14.2 Bipolar Disorder Acute Treatment of Manic and Mixed Episodes Adults Monotherapy The efficacy of ABILIFY as monotherapy in the acute treatment of manic episodes was established in four 3week, placebocontrolled trials in hospitalized patients who met the DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These studies included patients with or without psychotic features and two of the studies also included patients with or without a rapidcycling course. The primary instrument used for assessing manic symptoms was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), an 11item clinicianrated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptiveaggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, languagethought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). A key secondary instrument included the Clinical Global Impression  Bipolar (CGIBP) Scale. In the four positive, 3week, placebocontrolled trials (n268 n248 n480 n485) which evaluated ABILIFY in a range of 15 mg to 30 mg, once daily (with a starting dose of 15 mgday in two studies and 30 mgday in two studies), ABILIFY was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score and CGIBP Severity of Illness score (mania). In the two studies with a starting dose of 15 mgday, 48 and 44 of patients were on 15 mgday at endpoint. In the two studies with a starting dose of 30 mgday, 86 and 85 of patients were on 30 mgday at endpoint. Adjunctive Therapy The efficacy of adjunctive ABILIFY with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in a 6week, placebocontrolled study (n384) with a 2week leadin mood stabilizer monotherapy phase in adult patients who met DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder. This study included patients with manic or mixed episodes and with or without psychotic features. Patients were initiated on openlabel lithium (0.6 mEqL to 1.0 mEqL) or valproate (50 gmL to 125 gmL) at therapeutic serum levels, and remained on stable doses for 2 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks, patients demonstrating inadequate response (YMRS total score 16 and 25 improvement on the YMRS total score) to lithium or valproate were randomized to receive either aripiprazole (15 mgday or an increase to 30 mgday as early as day 7) or placebo as adjunctive therapy with openlabel lithium or valproate. In the 6week, placebocontrolled phase, adjunctive ABILIFY starting at 15 mgday with concomitant lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEqL to 1.0 mEqL or 50 gmL to 125 gmL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate with adjunctive placebo in the reduction of the YMRS total score and CGIBP Severity of Illness score (mania). Seventyone percent of the patients coadministered valproate and 62 of the patients coadministered lithium were on 15 mgday at 6week endpoint. Pediatric Patients The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of bipolar I disorder in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) was evaluated in one fourweek, placebocontrolled trial (n296) of outpatients who met DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features and had a YMRS score 20 at baseline. This doubleblind, placebocontrolled trial compared two fixed doses of ABILIFY (10 mgday or 30 mgday) to placebo. The ABILIFY dose was started at 2 mgday, which was titrated to 5 mgday after 2 days, and to the target dose in 5 days in the 10 mgday treatment arm and in 13 days in the 30 mgday treatment arm. Both doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in change from baseline to week 4 on the YMRS total score. Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder Monotherapy Maintenance Therapy A maintenance trial was conducted in adult patients meeting DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder with a recent manic or mixed episode who had been stabilized on openlabel ABILIFY and who had maintained a clinical response for at least 6 weeks. The first phase of this trial was an openlabel stabilization period in which inpatients and outpatients were clinically stabilized and then maintained on openlabel ABILIFY (15 mgday or 30 mgday, with a starting dose of 30 mgday) for at least 6 consecutive weeks. One hundred sixtyone outpatients were then randomized in a doubleblind fashion, to either the same dose of ABILIFY they were on at the end of the stabilization and maintenance period or placebo and were then monitored for manic or depressive relapse. During the randomization phase, ABILIFY was superior to placebo on time to the number of combined affective relapses (manic plus depressive), the primary outcome measure for this study. A total of 55 mood events were observed during the doubleblind treatment phase. Nineteen were from the ABILIFY group and 36 were from the placebo group. The number of observed manic episodes in the ABILIFY group (6) were fewer than that in the placebo group (19), while the number of depressive episodes in the ABILIFY group (9) was similar to that in the placebo group (11). An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age and gender however, there were insufficient numbers of patients in each of the ethnic groups to adequately assess intergroup differences. Adjunctive Maintenance Therapy An adjunctive maintenance trial was conducted in adult patients meeting DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder with a recent manic or mixed episode. Patients were initiated on openlabel lithium (0.6 mEqL to 1.0 mEqL) or valproate (50 gmL to 125 gmL) at therapeutic serum levels, and remained on stable doses for 2 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks, patients demonstrating inadequate response (YMRS total score 16 and 35 improvement on the YMRS total score) to lithium or valproate received aripiprazole with a starting dose of 15 mgday with the option to increase to 30 mg or reduce to 10 mg as early as day 4, as adjunctive therapy with openlabel lithium or valproate. Prior to randomization, patients on the combination of singleblind aripiprazole and lithium or valproate were required to maintain stability (YMRS and MADRS total scores 12) for 12 consecutive weeks. Three hundred and thirtyseven patients were then randomized in a doubleblind fashion, to either the same dose of ABILIFY they were on at the end of the stabilization period or placebo plus lithium or valproate and were then monitored for manic, mixed, or depressive relapse for a maximum of 52 weeks. ABILIFY was superior to placebo on the primary endpoint, time from randomization to relapse to any mood event. A mood event was defined as hospitalization for a manic, mixed or depressive episode, study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy accompanied by YMRS score 16 andor a MADRS 16, or an SAE of worsening disease accompanied by YMRS score 16 andor a MADRS 16. A total of 68 mood events were observed during the doubleblind treatment phase. Twentyfive were from the ABILIFY group and 43 were from the placebo group. The number of observed manic episodes in the ABILIFY group (7) were fewer than that in the placebo group (19), while the number of depressive episodes in the ABILIFY group (14) was similar to that in the placebo group (18). The KaplanMeier curves of the time from randomization to relapse to any mood event during the 52week doubleblind treatment phase for ABILIFY and placebo groups are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 KaplanMeier Estimation of Proportion of Relapses to Any Mood Event for ABILIFY and Placebo Groups An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age and gender however, there were insufficient numbers of patients in each of the ethnic groups to adequately assess intergroup differences. Figure 1 KaplanMeier Estimation of Proportion of Relapses to Any Mood Event for ABILIFY and Placebo Groups 14.3 Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder Adults The efficacy of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) was demonstrated in two shortterm (6week), placebocontrolled trials of adult patients meeting DSMIV criteria for MDD who had had an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) in the current episode and who had also demonstrated an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant therapy (paroxetine controlledrelease, venlafaxine extendedrelease, fluoxetine, escitalopram, or sertraline). Inadequate response for prospective treatment was defined as less than 50 improvement on the 17item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17), minimal HAMD17 score of 14, and a Clinical Global Impressions Improvement rating of no better than minimal improvement. Inadequate response to prior treatment was defined as less than 50 improvement as perceived by the patient after a minimum of 6 weeks of antidepressant therapy at or above the minimal effective dose. The primary instrument used for assessing depressive symptoms was the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10item clinicianrated scale used to assess the degree of depressive symptomatology (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). The key secondary instrument was the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a 3item selfrated instrument used to assess the impact of depression on three domains of functioning (workschool, social life, and family life) with each item scored from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extreme). In the two trials (n381, n362), ABILIFY was superior to placebo in reducing mean MADRS total scores. In one study, ABILIFY was also superior to placebo in reducing the mean SDS score. In both trials, patients received ABILIFY adjunctive to antidepressants at a dose of 5 mgday. Based on tolerability and efficacy, doses could be adjusted by 5 mg increments, one week apart. Allowable doses were 2 mgday, 5 mgday, 10 mgday, 15 mgday, and for patients who were not on potent CYP2D6 inhibitors fluoxetine and paroxetine, 20 mgday. The mean final dose at the end point for the two trials was 10.7 mgday and 11.4 mgday. An examination of population subgroups did not reveal evidence of differential response based on age, choice of prospective antidepressant, or race. With regard to gender, a smaller mean reduction on the MADRS total score was seen in males than in females. 14.4 Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder Pediatric Patients The efficacy of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) in the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder was established in two 8week, placebocontrolled trials in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) who met the DSMIV criteria for autistic disorder and demonstrated behaviors such as tantrums, aggression, selfinjurious behavior, or a combination of these problems. Over 75 of these subjects were under 13 years of age. Efficacy was evaluated using two assessment scales the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Clinical Global ImpressionImprovement (CGII) scale. The primary outcome measure in both trials was the change from baseline to endpoint in the Irritability subscale of the ABC (ABCI). The ABCI subscale measured the emotional and behavioral symptoms of irritability in autistic disorder, including aggression towards others, deliberate selfinjuriousness, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods. The results of these trials are as follows In one of the 8week, placebocontrolled trials, children and adolescents with autistic disorder (n98), aged 6 to 17 years, received daily doses of placebo or ABILIFY 2 mgday to 15 mgday. ABILIFY, starting at 2 mgday with increases allowed up to 15 mgday based on clinical response, significantly improved scores on the ABCI subscale and on the CGII scale compared with placebo. The mean daily dose of ABILIFY at the end of 8week treatment was 8.6 mgday. In the other 8week, placebocontrolled trial in children and adolescents with autistic disorder (n218), aged 6 to 17 years, three fixed doses of ABILIFY (5 mgday, 10 mgday, or 15 mgday) were compared to placebo. ABILIFY dosing started at 2 mgday and was increased to 5 mgday after one week. After a second week, it was increased to 10 mgday for patients in the 10 mg and 15 mg dose arms, and after a third week, it was increased to 15 mgday in the 15 mgday treatment arm. All three doses of ABILIFY significantly improved scores on the ABCI subscale compared with placebo. 14.5 Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania The efficacy of intramuscular aripiprazole for injection for the treatment of agitation was established in three shortterm (24hour), placebocontrolled trials in agitated inpatients from two diagnostic groups schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features). Each of the trials included a single active comparator treatment arm of either haloperidol injection (schizophrenia studies) or lorazepam injection (bipolar mania study). Patients could receive up to three injections during the 24hour treatment periods however, patients could not receive the second injection until after the initial 2hour period when the primary efficacy measure was assessed. Patients enrolled in the trials needed to be (1) judged by the clinical investigators as clinically agitated and clinically appropriate candidates for treatment with intramuscular medication, and (2) exhibiting a level of agitation that met or exceeded a threshold score of 15 on the five items comprising the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Excited Component (ie, poor impulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness, and excitement items) with at least two individual item scores 4 using a 17 scoring system (1  absent, 4  moderate, 7  extreme). In the studies, the mean baseline PANSS Excited Component score was 19, with scores ranging from 15 to 34 (out of a maximum score of 35), thus suggesting predominantly moderate levels of agitation with some patients experiencing mild or severe levels of agitation. The primary efficacy measure used for assessing agitation signs and symptoms in these trials was the change from baseline in the PANSS Excited Component at 2 hours postinjection. A key secondary measure was the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGII) Scale. The results of the trials follow In a placebocontrolled trial in agitated inpatients predominantly meeting DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia (n350), four fixed aripiprazole injection doses of 1 mg, 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, and 15 mg were evaluated. At 2 hours postinjection, the 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, and 15 mg doses were statistically superior to placebo in the PANSS Excited Component and on the CGII Scale. In a second placebocontrolled trial in agitated inpatients predominantly meeting DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia (n445), one fixed aripiprazole injection dose of 9.75 mg was evaluated. At 2 hours postinjection, aripiprazole for injection was statistically superior to placebo in the PANSS Excited Component and on the CGII Scale. In a placebocontrolled trial in agitated inpatients meeting DSMIV criteria for bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed) (n291), two fixed aripiprazole injection doses of 9.75 mg and 15 mg were evaluated. At 2 hours postinjection, both doses were statistically superior to placebo in the PANSS Excited Component. Examination of population subsets (age, race, and gender) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS In general, no dosage adjustment for ABILIFY is required on the basis of a patients age, gender, race, smoking status, hepatic function, or renal function see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5). 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C In animal studies, aripiprazole demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats were treated with oral doses of 3 mgkgday, 10 mgkgday, and 30 mgkgday (1 times, 3 times, and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD on a mgm2 basis) of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Gestation was slightly prolonged at 30 mgkg. Treatment caused a slight delay in fetal development, as evidenced by decreased fetal weight (30 mgkg), undescended testes (30 mgkg), and delayed skeletal ossification (10 mgkg and 30 mgkg). There were no adverse effects on embryofetal or pup survival. Delivered offspring had decreased body weights (10 mgkg and 30 mgkg), and increased incidences of hepatodiaphragmatic nodules and diaphragmatic hernia at 30 mgkg (the other dose groups were not examined for these findings). A low incidence of diaphragmatic hernia was also seen in the fetuses exposed to 30 mgkg. Postnatally, delayed vaginal opening was seen at 10 mgkg and 30 mgkg and impaired reproductive performance (decreased fertility rate, corpora lutea, implants, live fetuses, and increased postimplantation loss, likely mediated through effects on female offspring) was seen at 30 mgkg. Some maternal toxicity was seen at 30 mgkg however, there was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity. In pregnant rats receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously (3 mgkgday, 9 mgkgday, and 27 mgkgday) during the period of organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and delayed skeletal ossification were seen at the highest dose, which also caused some maternal toxicity. Pregnant rabbits were treated with oral doses of 10 mgkgday, 30 mgkgday, and 100 mgkgday (2 times, 3 times, and 11 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 6 times, 19 times, and 65 times the MRHD based on mgm2) of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Decreased maternal food consumption and increased abortions were seen at 100 mgkg. Treatment caused increased fetal mortality (100 mgkg), decreased fetal weight (30 mgkg and 100 mgkg), increased incidence of a skeletal abnormality (fused sternebrae at 30 mgkg and 100 mgkg), and minor skeletal variations (100 mgkg). In pregnant rabbits receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously (3 mgkgday, 10 mgkgday, and 30 mgkgday) during the period of organogenesis, the highest dose, which caused pronounced maternal toxicity, resulted in decreased fetal weight, increased fetal abnormalities (primarily skeletal), and decreased fetal skeletal ossification. The fetal noeffect dose was 10 mgkg, which produced 5 times the human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC and is 6 times the MRHD based on mgm2. In a study in which rats were treated with oral doses of 3 mgkgday, 10 mgkgday, and 30 mgkgday (1 times, 3 times, and 10 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) of aripiprazole perinatally and postnatally (from day 17 of gestation through day 21 postpartum), slight maternal toxicity and slightly prolonged gestation were seen at 30 mgkg. An increase in stillbirths and decreases in pup weight (persisting into adulthood) and survival were seen at this dose. In rats receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously (3 mgkgday, 8 mgkgday, and 20 mgkgday) from day 6 of gestation through day 20 postpartum, an increase in stillbirths was seen at 8 mgkg and 20 mgkg, and decreases in early postnatal pup weights and survival were seen at 20 mgkg. These doses produced some maternal toxicity. There were no effects on postnatal behavioral and reproductive development. Nonteratogenic Effects There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. It is not known whether aripiprazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal andor withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity while in some cases symptoms have been selflimited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Aripiprazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effect of aripiprazole on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Aripiprazole was excreted in milk of rats during lactation. It is not known whether aripiprazole or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. It is recommended that women receiving aripiprazole should not breastfeed. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with major depressive disorder or agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania have not been established. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with schizophrenia were established in a 6week, placebocontrolled clinical trial in 202 pediatric patients aged 13 to 17 years see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1.1), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1), ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2), and CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1). Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with bipolar mania were established in a 4week, placebocontrolled clinical trial in 197 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1.2), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2), ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2), and CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2). Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. The efficacy of adjunctive ABILIFY with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated. However, such efficacy and lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between aripiprazole and lithium or valproate can be extrapolated from adult data, along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients demonstrating irritability associated with autistic disorder were established in two 8week, placebocontrolled clinical trials in 212 pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1.4) , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4) , ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2), and CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4). Maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. 8.5 Geriatric Use In formal singledose pharmacokinetic studies (with aripiprazole given in a single dose of 15 mg), aripiprazole clearance was 20 lower in elderly (65 years) subjects compared to younger adult subjects (18 to 64 years). There was no detectable age effect, however, in the population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenia patients. Also, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole after multiple doses in elderly patients appeared similar to that observed in young, healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients see also BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1). Of the 13,543 patients treated with oral aripiprazole in clinical trials, 1073 (8) were 65 years old and 799 (6) were 75 years old. The majority (81) of the 1073 patients were diagnosed with Dementia of the Alzheimers type. Placebocontrolled studies of oral aripiprazole in schizophrenia, bipolar mania, or major depressive disorder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Of the 749 patients treated with aripiprazole injection in clinical trials, 99 (13) were 65 years old and 78 (10) were 75 years old. Placebocontrolled studies of aripiprazole injection in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Studies of elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimers disease have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile in this population compared to younger patients with schizophrenia see also BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1). The safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimers disease has not been established. If the prescriber elects to treat such patients with ABILIFY, vigilance should be exercised. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 mLmin), Cmax of aripiprazole (given in a single dose of 15 mg) and dehydroaripiprazole increased by 36 and 53, respectively, but AUC was 15 lower for aripiprazole and 7 higher for dehydroaripiprazole. Renal excretion of both unchanged aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole is less than 1 of the dose. No dosage adjustment is required in subjects with renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In a singledose study (15 mg of aripiprazole) in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (ChildPugh Classes A, B, and C), the AUC of aripiprazole, compared to healthy subjects, increased 31 in mild HI, increased 8 in moderate HI, and decreased 20 in severe HI. None of these differences would require dose adjustment. 8.8 Gender Cmax and AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, are 30 to 40 higher in women than in men, and correspondingly, the apparent oral clearance of aripiprazole is lower in women. These differences, however, are largely explained by differences in body weight (25) between men and women. No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. 8.9 Race Although no specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race on the disposition of aripiprazole, population pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed no evidence of clinically significant racerelated differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. 8.10 Smoking Based on studies utilizing human liver enzymes in vitro, aripiprazole is not a substrate for CYP1A2 and also does not undergo direct glucuronidation. Smoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. Consistent with these in vitro results, population pharmacokinetic evaluation did not reveal any significant pharmacokinetic differences between smokers and nonsmokers. No dosage adjustment is recommended based on smoking status.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice and in SpragueDawley (SD) and F344 rats. Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1 mgkgday, 3 mgkgday, 10 mgkgday, and 30 mgkgday to ICR mice and 1 mgkgday, 3 mgkgday, and 10 mgkgday to F344 rats (0.2 times to 5 times and 0.3 times to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD based on mgm2, respectively). In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10 mgkgday, 20 mgkgday, 40 mgkgday, and 60 mgkgday (3 times to 19 times the MRHD based on mgm2). Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or rats. In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 mgkgday to 30 mgkgday (0.1 times to 0.9 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 0.5 times to 5 times the MRHD based on mgm2). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mgkgday (0.1 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 3 times the MRHD based on mgm2) and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomascarcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mgkgday (14 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 19 times the MRHD based on mgm2). Proliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary gland of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered prolactinmediated. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4week and 13week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactinmediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown. Mutagenesis The mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the in vitro bacterial reversemutation assay, the in vitro bacterial DNA repair assay, the in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3DCPP) were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3DCPP, produced increases in numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice however, the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans. Impairment of Fertility Female rats were treated with oral doses of 2 mgkgday, 6 mgkgday, and 20 mgkgday (0.6 times, 2 times, and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose MRHD on a mgm2 basis) of aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through day 7 of gestation. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased preimplantation loss was seen at 6 mgkg and 20 mgkg and decreased fetal weight was seen at 20 mgkg. Male rats were treated with oral doses of 20 mgkgday, 40 mgkgday, and 60 mgkgday (6 times, 13 times, and 19 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) of aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating. Disturbances in spermatogenesis were seen at 60 mgkg and prostate atrophy was seen at 40 mgkg and 60 mgkg, but no impairment of fertility was seen. 13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology Aripiprazole produced retinal degeneration in albino rats in a 26week chronic toxicity study at a dose of 60 mgkg and in a 2year carcinogenicity study at doses of 40 mgkg and 60 mgkg. The 40 mgkg and 60 mgkg doses are 13 times and 19 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on mgm2 and 7 times to 14 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice and of monkeys did not reveal evidence of retinal degeneration. Additional studies to further evaluate the mechanism have not been performed. The relevance of this finding to human risk is unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use In formal singledose pharmacokinetic studies (with aripiprazole given in a single dose of 15 mg), aripiprazole clearance was 20 lower in elderly (65 years) subjects compared to younger adult subjects (18 to 64 years). There was no detectable age effect, however, in the population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenia patients. Also, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole after multiple doses in elderly patients appeared similar to that observed in young, healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients see also BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1). Of the 13,543 patients treated with oral aripiprazole in clinical trials, 1073 (8) were 65 years old and 799 (6) were 75 years old. The majority (81) of the 1073 patients were diagnosed with Dementia of the Alzheimers type. Placebocontrolled studies of oral aripiprazole in schizophrenia, bipolar mania, or major depressive disorder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Of the 749 patients treated with aripiprazole injection in clinical trials, 99 (13) were 65 years old and 78 (10) were 75 years old. Placebocontrolled studies of aripiprazole injection in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Studies of elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimers disease have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile in this population compared to younger patients with schizophrenia see also BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1). The safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimers disease has not been established. If the prescriber elects to treat such patients with ABILIFY, vigilance should be exercised.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIARELATED PSYCHOSIS and SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ABILIFY (aripiprazole) is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1). Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in shortterm studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of adjunctive ABILIFY or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Shortterm studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. ABILIFY is not approved for use in pediatric patients with depression see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2). WARNINGS INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIARELATED PSYCHOSIS and SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis. (5.1) Children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior.

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE MedDRA terminology has been used to classify the adverse reactions. 10.1 Human Experience A total of 76 cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage with oral aripiprazole have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with oral aripiprazole alone and in combination with other substances. No fatality was reported from these cases. Of the 44 cases with known outcome, 33 cases recovered without sequelae and one case recovered with sequelae (mydriasis and feeling abnormal). The largest known case of acute ingestion with a known outcome involved 1080 mg of oral aripiprazole (36 times the maximum recommended daily dose) in a patient who fully recovered. Included in the 76 cases are 10 cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage in children (age 12 and younger) involving oral aripiprazole ingestions up to 195 mg with no fatalities. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 5 of all overdose cases) reported with oral aripiprazole overdosage (alone or in combination with other substances) include vomiting, somnolence, and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in one or more patients with aripiprazole overdoses (alone or with other substances) include acidosis, aggression, aspartate aminotransferase increased, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusional state, convulsion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, QRS complex prolonged, QT prolonged, pneumonia aspiration, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and tachycardia. 10.2 Management of Overdosage No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with aripiprazole. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and if QT interval prolongation is present, cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. Charcoal In the event of an overdose of ABILIFY, an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole. Administration of 50 g of activated charcoal, one hour after a single 15 mg oral dose of aripiprazole, decreased the mean AUC and Cmax of aripiprazole by 50. Hemodialysis Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors (Ki values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2C and 5HT7, alpha1adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors (Ki values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC501000 nM). Aripiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and the serotonin 5HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at serotonin 5HT2A receptor.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (eg, stroke, transient ischemic attack, including fatalities) (5.1) Suicidality and Antidepressants Increased risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults with major depressive disorder (5.2) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring (5.3) Tardive Dyskinesia Discontinue if clinically appropriate (5.4) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Monitor glucose regularly in patients with and at risk for diabetes (5.5) Orthostatic Hypotension Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease (5.6) Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis have been reported with antipsychotics including ABILIFY. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low white blood cell count (WBC) or a druginduced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of ABILIFY should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors (5.7) SeizuresConvulsions Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold (5.8) Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Use caution when operating machinery (5.9) Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Closely supervise highrisk patients (5.11) 5.1 Use in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Increased Mortality Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. ABILIFY (aripiprazole) is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see BOXED WARNING. Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke In placebocontrolled clinical studies (two flexible dose and one fixed dose study) of dementiarelated psychosis, there was an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (eg, stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, in aripiprazoletreated patients (mean age 84 years range 7888 years). In the fixeddose study, there was a statistically significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole. Aripiprazole is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis see also BOXED WARNING. Safety Experience in Elderly Patients with Psychosis Associated with Alzheimers Disease In three, 10week, placebocontrolled studies of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimers disease (n938 mean age 82.4 years range 5699 years), the treatmentemergent adverse events that were reported at an incidence of 3 and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo were lethargy placebo 2, aripiprazole 5, somnolence (including sedation) placebo 3, aripiprazole 8, and incontinence (primarily, urinary incontinence) placebo 1, aripiprazole 5, excessive salivation placebo 0, aripiprazole 4, and lightheadedness placebo 1, aripiprazole 4. The safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of patients with psychosis associated with dementia have not been established. If the prescriber elects to treat such patients with ABILIFY, vigilance should be exercised, particularly for the emergence of difficulty swallowing or excessive somnolence, which could predispose to accidental injury or aspiration see also BOXED WARNING. 5.2 Clinical Worsening of Depression and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression andor the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a longstanding concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of shortterm placebocontrolled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 1824) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Shortterm studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 shortterm trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 shortterm trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drugplacebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 4. Table 4 Age Range DrugPlacebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo 18 14 additional cases 1824 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 2564 1 fewer case 65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longerterm use, ie, beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebocontrolled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression andor the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for ABILIFY should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixedmanic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that ABILIFY is not approved for use in treating depression in the pediatric population. 5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Rare cases of NMS occurred during aripiprazole treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (eg, pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. 5.4 Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and, thereby, may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, ABILIFY should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ABILIFY despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.5 Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with ABILIFY see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2, 6.3). Although fewer patients have been treated with ABILIFY, it is not known if this more limited experience is the sole reason for the paucity of such reports. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemiarelated adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies which did not include ABILIFY suggest an increased risk of treatmentemergent hyperglycemiarelated adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics included in these studies. Because ABILIFY was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if ABILIFY is associated with this increased risk. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemiarelated adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (eg, obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. 5.6 Orthostatic Hypotension Aripiprazole may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its 1adrenergic receptor antagonism. The incidence of orthostatic hypotensionassociated events from shortterm, placebocontrolled trials of adult patients on oral ABILIFY (n2467) included (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence) orthostatic hypotension (1, 0.3), postural dizziness (0.5, 0.3), and syncope (0.5, 0.4) of pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age (n611) on oral ABILIFY included orthostatic hypotension (0.5, 0), postural dizziness (0.3, 0), and syncope (0.2, 0) and of patients on ABILIFY Injection (n501) included orthostatic hypotension (0.6, 0), postural dizziness (0.2, 0.5), and syncope (0.4, 0). The incidence of a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure 20 mmHg accompanied by an increase in heart rate 25 when comparing standing to supine values) for aripiprazole was not meaningfully different from placebo (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence) in adult oral aripiprazoletreated patients (4, 2), in pediatric oral aripiprazoletreated patients aged 6 to 17 years (0.2, 1), or in aripiprazole injectiontreated patients (3, 2). Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). If parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole injection treatment, patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3). 5.7 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis Class Effect In clinical trial andor postmarketing experience, events of leukopenianeutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY. Agranulocytosis has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenianeutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of druginduced leukopenianeutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or druginduced leukopenianeutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of ABILIFY should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 1000mm3) should discontinue ABILIFY and have their WBC followed until recovery. 5.8 SeizuresConvulsions In shortterm, placebocontrolled trials, seizuresconvulsions occurred in 0.1 (32467) of adult patients treated with oral aripiprazole, in 0.2 (1611) of pediatric patients (6 to 17 years), and in 0.2 (1501) of adult aripiprazole injectiontreated patients. As with other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold, eg, Alzheimers dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.9 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment ABILIFY, like other antipsychotics, may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. For example, in shortterm, placebocontrolled trials, somnolence (including sedation) was reported as follows (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence) in adult patients (n2467) treated with oral ABILIFY (11, 6), in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 (n611) (24, 6), and in adult patients (n501) on ABILIFY Injection (9, 6). Somnolence (including sedation) led to discontinuation in 0.3 (82467) of adult patients and 3 (15611) of pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) on oral ABILIFY in shortterm, placebocontrolled trials, but did not lead to discontinuation of any adult patients on ABILIFY Injection. Despite the relatively modest increased incidence of these events compared to placebo, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with ABILIFY does not affect them adversely. 5.10 Body Temperature Regulation Disruption of the bodys ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing aripiprazole for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, (eg, exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration) see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3). 5.11 Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, and close supervision of highrisk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for ABILIFY should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2, 6.3). In two 6week, placebocontrolled studies of aripiprazole as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, the incidences of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were 0 (0371) for aripiprazole and 0.5 (2366) for placebo. 5.12 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimers dementia. Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3). 5.13 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with ABILIFY in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6, 8.7). ABILIFY has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease.

<tr><td><i>animal_pharmacology_and_or_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology Aripiprazole produced retinal degeneration in albino rats in a 26week chronic toxicity study at a dose of 60 mgkg and in a 2year carcinogenicity study at doses of 40 mgkg and 60 mgkg. The 40 mgkg and 60 mgkg doses are 13 times and 19 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on mgm2 and 7 times to 14 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice and of monkeys did not reveal evidence of retinal degeneration. Additional studies to further evaluate the mechanism have not been performed. The relevance of this finding to human risk is unknown.</td></tr>
