<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in rats at doses of up to 5000 parts per million (ppm) in complete feed (approximately 340 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on surface area) for 30 months showed no evidence of carcinogenesis. In mice, administration of glimepiride for 24 months resulted in an increase in benign pancreatic adenoma formation that was doserelated and was thought to be the result of chronic pancreatic stimulation. No adenoma formation in mice was observed at a dose of 320 ppm in complete feed, or 46 to 54 mgkg body weightday. This is about 35 times the maximum human recommended dose of 8 mg once daily based on surface area. Glimepiride was nonmutagenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies (Ames test, somatic cell mutation, chromosomal aberration, unscheduled DNA synthesis, and mouse micronucleus test). There was no effect of glimepiride on male mouse fertility in animals exposed up to 2500 mgkg body weight (1,700 times the maximum recommended human dose based on surface area). Glimepiride had no effect on the fertility of male and female rats administered up to 4000 mgkg body weight (approximately 4,000 times the maximum recommended human dose based on surface area).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of glimepiride in pregnant women. In animal studies there was no increase in congenital anomalies, but an increase in fetal deaths occurred in rats and rabbits at glimepiride doses 50 times (rats) and 0.1 times (rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (based on body surface area). This fetotoxicity, observed only at doses inducing maternal hypoglycemia, is believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glimepiride and has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas. Glimepiride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Because data suggest that abnormal blood glucose during pregnancy is associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> treatment during pregnancy should maintain blood glucose as close to normal as possible. Nonteratogenic Effects Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Studies with single oral doses of glimepiride in healthy subjects and with multiple oral doses in patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> showed peak drug concentrations (Cmax) 2 to 3 hours postdose. When glimepiride was given with meals, the mean Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) were decreased by 8 and 9, respectively. Glimepiride does not accumulate in serum following multiple dosing. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride does not differ between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b>. Clearance of glimepiride after oral administration does not change over the 1 mg to 8 mg dose range, indicating linear pharmacokinetics. In healthy subjects, the intra and interindividual variabilities of glimepiride pharmacokinetic parameters were 1523 and 2429, respectively. Distribution After intravenous dosing in healthy subjects, the volume of distribution (Vd) was 8.8 L (113 mLkg), and the total body clearance (CL) was 47.8 mLmin. Protein binding was greater than 99.5. Metabolism Glimepiride is completely metabolized by oxidative biotransformation after either an intravenous or oral dose. The major metabolites are the cyclohexyl hydroxy methyl derivative (M1) and the carboxyl derivative (M2). Cytochrome P450 2C9 is involved in the biotransformation of glimepiride to M1. M1 is further metabolized to M2 by one or several cytosolic enzymes. M2 is inactive. In animals, M1 possesses about onethird of the pharmacological activity of glimepiride, but it is unclear whether M1 results in clinically meaningful effects on blood glucose in humans. Excretion When 14Cglimepiride was given orally to 3 healthy male subjects, approximately 60 of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in 7 days. M1 and M2 accounted for 8090 of the radioactivity recovered in the urine. The ratio of M1 to M2 in the urine was approximately 32 in two subjects and 41 in one subject. Approximately 40 of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces. M1 and M2 accounted for about 70 (ratio of M1 to M2 was 13) of the radioactivity recovered in feces. No parent drug was recovered from urine or feces. After intravenous dosing in patients, no significant biliary excretion of glimepiride or its M1 metabolite was observed. Geriatric Patients A comparison of glimepiride pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> 65 years and those 65 years was evaluated in a multipledose study using glimepiride tablets 6 mg daily. There were no significant differences in glimepiride pharmacokinetics between the two age groups. The mean AUC at steady state for the older patients was approximately 13 lower than that for the younger patients the mean weightadjusted clearance for the older patients was approximately 11 higher than that for the younger patients. Gender There were no differences between males and females in the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride when adjustment was made for differences in body weight. Race No studies have been conducted to assess the effects of race on glimepiride pharmacokinetics but in placebocontrolled trials of glimepiride in patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b>, the reduction in HbA1C was comparable in Caucasians (n  536), blacks (n  63), and Hispanics (n  63). Renal Impairment A singledose, openlabel study glimepiride tablets 3 mg was administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as estimated by creatinine clearance (CLcr) Group I consisted of 5 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr  50 mLmin), Group II consisted of 3 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr  20 to 50 mLmin) and Group III consisted of 7 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr  20 mLmin). Although, glimepiride serum concentrations decreased with decreasing renal function, Group III had a 2.3fold higher mean AUC for M1 and an 8.6fold higher mean AUC for M2 compared to corresponding mean AUCs in Group I. The apparent terminal halflife (T12) for glimepiride did not change, while the halflives for M1 and M2 increased as renal function decreased. Mean urinary excretion of M1 plus M2 as a percentage of dose decreased from 44.4 for Group I to 21.9 for Group II and 9.3 for Group III. Hepatic Impairment It is unknown whether there is an effect of hepatic impairment on glimepiride pharmacokinetics because the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride has not been adequately evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride and its metabolites were measured in a singledose study involving 28 patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> who either had normal body weight or were morbidly obese. While the tmax, clearance, and volume of distribution of glimepiride in the morbidly obese patients were similar to those in the normal weight group, the morbidly obese had lower Cmax and AUC than those of normal body weight. The mean Cmax, AUC024, AUC0 values of glimepiride in normal vs. morbidly obese patients were 547  218 ngmL vs. 410  124 ngmL, 3210  1030 hoursngmL vs. 2820  1110 hoursngmL and 4000  1320 hoursngmL vs. 3280  1360 hoursngmL, respectively. Drug Interactions Aspirin In a randomized, doubleblind, twoperiod, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or aspirin 1 gram three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days. On Day 4 of each study period, a single 1 mg dose of glimepiride tablets was administered. The glimepiride tablets doses were separated by a 14day washout period. Coadministration of aspirin and glimepiride resulted in a 34 decrease in the mean glimepiride AUC and a 4 decrease in the mean glimepiride Cmax. Colesevelam Concomitant administration of colesevelam and glimepiride resulted in reductions in glimepiride AUC0 and Cmax of 18 and 8, respectively. When glimepiride was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was no significant change in glimepiride AUC0 or Cmax, 6 and 3, respectively see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4). Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a randomized, openlabel, 3way crossover study, healthy subjects received either a single 4 mg dose of glimepiride tablets alone, glimepiride with ranitidine (150 mg twice daily for 4 days glimepiride was administered on Day 3), or glimepiride with cimetidine (800 mg daily for 4 days glimepiride was administered on Day 3). Coadministration of cimetidine or ranitidine with a single 4 mg oral dose of glimepiride tablets did not significantly alter the absorption and disposition of glimepiride. Propranolol In a randomized, doubleblind, twoperiod, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or propranolol 40 mg three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days. On Day 4 or each study period, a single 2 mg dose of glimepiride tablets was administered. The glimepiride tablets doses were separated by a 14day washout period. Concomitant administration of propranolol and glimepiride significantly increased glimepiride Cmax, AUC, and T12 by 23, 22, and 15, respectively, and decreased glimepiride CLf by 18. The recovery of M1 and M2 from urine was not changed. Warfarin In an openlabel, twoway, crossover study, healthy subjects received 4 mg of glimepiride tablets daily for 10 days. Single 25 mg doses of warfarin were administered 6 days before starting glimepiride and on Day 4 of glimepiride administration. The concomitant administration of glimepiride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of R and Swarfarin enantiomers. No changes were observed in warfarin plasma protein binding. Glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the pharmacodynamic response to warfarin. The reductions in mean area under the prothrombin time (PT) curve and maximum PT values during glimepiride treatment were 3.3 and 9.9, respectively, and are unlikely to be clinically relevant.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Certain medications may affect glucose metabolism, requiring glimepiride tablets dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose (7.1). Miconazole Severe hypoglycemia can occur when glimepiride and oral miconazole are used concomitantly. (7.2). Cytochrome P450 2C9 interactions Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 2C9 may affect glycemic control by altering glimepiride plasma concentrations (7.3). Colesevelam Coadministration may reduce glimepiride absorption. Glimepiride should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam (2.1, 7.4). 7.1 Drugs Affecting Glucose Metabolism A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require glimepiride tablets dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring for hypoglycemia or worsening glycemic control. The following are examples of medications that may increase the glucoselowering effect of sulfonylureas including glimepiride, increasing the susceptibility to andor intensity of hypoglycemia oral antidiabetic medications, pramlintide acetate, insulin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists, fibrates, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, somatostatin analogs, anabolic steroids and androgens, cyclophosphamide, phenyramidol, guanethidine, fluconazole, sulfinpyrazone, tetracyclines, clarithromycin, disopyramide, quinolones, and those drugs that are highly proteinbound, such as fluoxetine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, coumarins, probenecid and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. When these medications are administered to a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia. When these medications are withdrawn from a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for worsening glycemic control. The following are examples of medications that may reduce the glucoselowering effect of sulfonylureas including glimepiride, leading to worsening glycemic control danazol, glucagon, somatropin, protease inhibitors, atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), barbiturates, diazoxide, laxatives, rifampin, thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid hormones, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), and isoniazid. When these medications are administered to a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for worsening glycemic control. When these medications are withdrawn from a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia. Betablockers, clonidine, and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of glimepirides glucoselowering effect. Both acute and chronic alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the glucoselowering action of glimepiride in an unpredictable fashion. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as betablockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. 7.2 Miconazole A potential interaction between oral miconazole and sulfonylureas leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with other dosage forms of miconazole is not known. 7.3 Cytochrome P450 2C9 Interactions There may be an interaction between glimepiride and inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) and inducers (e.g., rifampin) of cytochrome P450 2C9. Fluconazole may inhibit the metabolism of glimepiride, causing increased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to hypoglycemia. Rifampin may induce the metabolism of glimepiride, causing decreased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to worsening glycemic control. 7.4 Concomitant Administration of Colesevelam Colesevelam can reduce the maximum plasma concentration and total exposure of glimepiride when the two are coadministered. However, absorption is not reduced when glimepiride is administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam. Therefore, glimepiride should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.4 Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of glimepiride have been evaluated in pediatric patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> as described below. Glimepiride tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients because of its adverse effects on body weight and hypoglycemia. The pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg single dose of glimepiride was evaluated in 30 patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> (male  7 female  23) between ages 10 and 17 years. The mean ( SD) AUC(0last) (339203 nghrmL), Cmax (10248 ngmL) and t12 (3.11.7 hours) for glimepiride were comparable to historical data from adults (AUC(0last) 31596 nghrmL, Cmax 10334 ngmL and t12 5.34.1 hours). The safety and efficacy of glimepiride in pediatric patients was evaluated in a singleblind, 24week trial that randomized 272 patients (8 to 17 years of age) with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> to glimepiride (n135) or metformin (n137). Both treatmentnave patients (those treated with only diet and exercise for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization) and previously treated patients (those previously treated or currently treated with other oral antidiabetic medications for at least 3 months) were eligible to participate. Patients who were receiving oral antidiabetic agents at the time of study entry discontinued these medications before randomization without a washout period. Glimepiride was initiated at 1 mg, and then titrated up to 2, 4 or 8 mg (mean last dose 4 mg) through Week 12, targeting a selfmonitored fasting fingerstick blood glucose  126 mgdL. Metformin was initiated at 500 mg twice daily and titrated at Week 12 up to 1000 mg twice daily (mean last dose 1365 mg). After 24 weeks, the overall mean treatment difference in HbA1c between glimepiride and metformin was 0.2, favoring metformin (95 confidence interval 0.3 to 0.6). Based on these results, the trial did not meet its primary objective of showing a similar reduction in HbA1c with glimepiride compared to metformin. Table 2.

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail below and elsewhere in the labeling Hypoglycemia see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) Hemolytic anemia see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with glimepiride were hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, and nausea. Common adverse reactions in clinical trials (5 and more common than with placebo) include hypoglycemia, headache, nausea, and dizziness (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Inc. at 18883753784 or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Approximately 2,800 patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> have been treated with glimepiride in the controlled clinical trials. In these trials, approximately 1,700 patients were treated with glimepiride for at least 1 year. Table 1 summarizes adverse events, other than hypoglycemia, that were reported in 11 pooled placebocontrolled trials, whether or not considered to be possibly or probably related to study medication. Treatment duration ranged from 13 weeks to 12 months. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of 5 among glimepiridetreated patients and more commonly than in patients who received placebo. Table 1. Eleven Pooled PlaceboControlled Trials ranging from 13 weeks to 12 months Adverse Events (Excluding Hypoglycemia) Occurring in 5 of glimepiridetreated Patients and at a Greater Incidence than with Placebo Glimepiride N745  Placebo N294  Headache 8.2 7.8 Accidental Injury 5.8 3.4 Flu Syndrome 5.4 4.4 Nausea 5 3.4 Dizziness 5 2.4  Glimepiride doses ranged from 1 to 16 mg administered daily Insufficient information to determine whether any of the accidental injury events were associated with hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia In a randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled monotherapy trial of 14 weeks duration, patients already on sulfonylurea therapy underwent a 3week washout period then were randomized to glimepiride tablets 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg or placebo. Patients randomized to glimepiride tablets 4 mg or 8 mg underwent forcedtitration from an initial dose of 1 mg to these final doses, as tolerated see Clinical Studies (14.1). The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (defined by the presence of at least one symptom that the investigator believed might be related to hypoglycemia a concurrent glucose measurement was not required) was 4 for glimepiride tablets 1 mg, 17 for glimepiride tablets 4 mg, 16 for glimepiride tablets 8 mg and 0 for placebo. All of these events were selftreated. In a randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled monotherapy trial of 22 weeks duration, patients received a starting dose of either 1 mg glimepiride tablets or placebo daily. The dose of glimepiride tablets was titrated to a target fasting plasma glucose of 90 to 150 mgdL. Final daily doses of glimepiride tablets were 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 mg see Clinical Studies (14.1). The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (as defined above for the 14week trial) for glimepiride vs. placebo was 19.7 vs. 3.2. All of these events were selftreated. Weight gain Glimepiride, like all sulfonylureas, can cause weight gain see Clinical Studies (14.1). Allergic Reactions In clinical trials, allergic reactions, such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occurred in less than 1 of glimepiridetreated patients. These may resolve despite continued treatment with glimepiride. There are postmarketing reports of more serious allergic reactions (e.g., dyspnea, hypotension, shock) see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). Laboratory Tests Elevated Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) In 11 pooled placebocontrolled trials of glimepiride, 1.9 of glimepiridetreated patients and 0.8 of placebotreated patients developed serum ALT greater than 2 times the upper limit of the reference range. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of glimepiride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and StevensJohnson Syndrome see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) Hemolytic anemia in patients with and without G6PD deficiency see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  Impairment of liver function (e.g. with cholestasis and jaundice), as well as hepatitis, which may progress to liver failure.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose is 1 or 2 mg once daily. Increase in 1 or 2 mg increments no more frequently than every 1 to 2 weeks based on glycemic response. Maximum recommended dose is 8 mg once daily (2.1). Administer with breakfast or first meal of the day (2.1). Use 1 mg starting dose and titrate slowly in patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia (e.g., elderly, patients with renal impairment) (2.1). 2.1 Recommended Dosing Glimepiride tablets should be administered with breakfast or the first main meal of the day. The recommended starting dose of glimepiride tablets are 1 mg or 2 mg once daily. Patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly or patients with renal impairment) should be started on 1 mg once daily see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6). After reaching a daily dose of 2 mg, further dose increases can be made in increments of 1 mg or 2 mg based upon the patients glycemic response. Uptitration should not occur more frequently than every 1 to 2 weeks. A conservative titration scheme is recommended for patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6). The maximum recommended dose is 8 mg once daily. Patients being transferred to glimepiride tablets from longer halflife sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) may have overlapping drug effect for 1 to 2 weeks and should be appropriately monitored for hypoglycemia. When colesevelam is coadministered with glimepiride, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glimepiride is reduced. Therefore, glimepiride tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action Glimepiride primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic betacell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATPsensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical trials of glimepiride, 1053 of 3491 patients (30) were 65 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. There were no significant differences in glimepiride pharmacokinetics between patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> 65 years (n49) and those 65 years (n42) see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Glimepiride is substantially excreted by the kidney. Elderly patients are more likely to have renal impairment. In addition, hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Use caution when initiating glimepiride and increasing the dose of glimepiride tablets in this patient population.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Glimepiride primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic betacell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATPsensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects, the time to reach maximal effect (minimum blood glucose concentrations) was approximately 2 to 3 hours after single oral doses of glimepiride tablets. The effects of glimepiride on HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial glucose have been assessed in clinical trials see Clinical Studies (14). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Studies with single oral doses of glimepiride in healthy subjects and with multiple oral doses in patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> showed peak drug concentrations (Cmax) 2 to 3 hours postdose. When glimepiride was given with meals, the mean Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) were decreased by 8 and 9, respectively. Glimepiride does not accumulate in serum following multiple dosing. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride does not differ between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b>. Clearance of glimepiride after oral administration does not change over the 1 mg to 8 mg dose range, indicating linear pharmacokinetics. In healthy subjects, the intra and interindividual variabilities of glimepiride pharmacokinetic parameters were 1523 and 2429, respectively. Distribution After intravenous dosing in healthy subjects, the volume of distribution (Vd) was 8.8 L (113 mLkg), and the total body clearance (CL) was 47.8 mLmin. Protein binding was greater than 99.5. Metabolism Glimepiride is completely metabolized by oxidative biotransformation after either an intravenous or oral dose. The major metabolites are the cyclohexyl hydroxy methyl derivative (M1) and the carboxyl derivative (M2). Cytochrome P450 2C9 is involved in the biotransformation of glimepiride to M1. M1 is further metabolized to M2 by one or several cytosolic enzymes. M2 is inactive. In animals, M1 possesses about onethird of the pharmacological activity of glimepiride, but it is unclear whether M1 results in clinically meaningful effects on blood glucose in humans. Excretion When 14Cglimepiride was given orally to 3 healthy male subjects, approximately 60 of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in 7 days. M1 and M2 accounted for 8090 of the radioactivity recovered in the urine. The ratio of M1 to M2 in the urine was approximately 32 in two subjects and 41 in one subject. Approximately 40 of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces. M1 and M2 accounted for about 70 (ratio of M1 to M2 was 13) of the radioactivity recovered in feces. No parent drug was recovered from urine or feces. After intravenous dosing in patients, no significant biliary excretion of glimepiride or its M1 metabolite was observed. Geriatric Patients A comparison of glimepiride pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> 65 years and those 65 years was evaluated in a multipledose study using glimepiride tablets 6 mg daily. There were no significant differences in glimepiride pharmacokinetics between the two age groups. The mean AUC at steady state for the older patients was approximately 13 lower than that for the younger patients the mean weightadjusted clearance for the older patients was approximately 11 higher than that for the younger patients. Gender There were no differences between males and females in the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride when adjustment was made for differences in body weight. Race No studies have been conducted to assess the effects of race on glimepiride pharmacokinetics but in placebocontrolled trials of glimepiride in patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b>, the reduction in HbA1C was comparable in Caucasians (n  536), blacks (n  63), and Hispanics (n  63). Renal Impairment A singledose, openlabel study glimepiride tablets 3 mg was administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as estimated by creatinine clearance (CLcr) Group I consisted of 5 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr  50 mLmin), Group II consisted of 3 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr  20 to 50 mLmin) and Group III consisted of 7 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr  20 mLmin). Although, glimepiride serum concentrations decreased with decreasing renal function, Group III had a 2.3fold higher mean AUC for M1 and an 8.6fold higher mean AUC for M2 compared to corresponding mean AUCs in Group I. The apparent terminal halflife (T12) for glimepiride did not change, while the halflives for M1 and M2 increased as renal function decreased. Mean urinary excretion of M1 plus M2 as a percentage of dose decreased from 44.4 for Group I to 21.9 for Group II and 9.3 for Group III. Hepatic Impairment It is unknown whether there is an effect of hepatic impairment on glimepiride pharmacokinetics because the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride has not been adequately evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride and its metabolites were measured in a singledose study involving 28 patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> who either had normal body weight or were morbidly obese. While the tmax, clearance, and volume of distribution of glimepiride in the morbidly obese patients were similar to those in the normal weight group, the morbidly obese had lower Cmax and AUC than those of normal body weight. The mean Cmax, AUC024, AUC0 values of glimepiride in normal vs. morbidly obese patients were 547  218 ngmL vs. 410  124 ngmL, 3210  1030 hoursngmL vs. 2820  1110 hoursngmL and 4000  1320 hoursngmL vs. 3280  1360 hoursngmL, respectively. Drug Interactions Aspirin In a randomized, doubleblind, twoperiod, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or aspirin 1 gram three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days. On Day 4 of each study period, a single 1 mg dose of glimepiride tablets was administered. The glimepiride tablets doses were separated by a 14day washout period. Coadministration of aspirin and glimepiride resulted in a 34 decrease in the mean glimepiride AUC and a 4 decrease in the mean glimepiride Cmax. Colesevelam Concomitant administration of colesevelam and glimepiride resulted in reductions in glimepiride AUC0 and Cmax of 18 and 8, respectively. When glimepiride was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was no significant change in glimepiride AUC0 or Cmax, 6 and 3, respectively see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4). Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a randomized, openlabel, 3way crossover study, healthy subjects received either a single 4 mg dose of glimepiride tablets alone, glimepiride with ranitidine (150 mg twice daily for 4 days glimepiride was administered on Day 3), or glimepiride with cimetidine (800 mg daily for 4 days glimepiride was administered on Day 3). Coadministration of cimetidine or ranitidine with a single 4 mg oral dose of glimepiride tablets did not significantly alter the absorption and disposition of glimepiride. Propranolol In a randomized, doubleblind, twoperiod, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or propranolol 40 mg three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days. On Day 4 or each study period, a single 2 mg dose of glimepiride tablets was administered. The glimepiride tablets doses were separated by a 14day washout period. Concomitant administration of propranolol and glimepiride significantly increased glimepiride Cmax, AUC, and T12 by 23, 22, and 15, respectively, and decreased glimepiride CLf by 18. The recovery of M1 and M2 from urine was not changed. Warfarin In an openlabel, twoway, crossover study, healthy subjects received 4 mg of glimepiride tablets daily for 10 days. Single 25 mg doses of warfarin were administered 6 days before starting glimepiride and on Day 4 of glimepiride administration. The concomitant administration of glimepiride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of R and Swarfarin enantiomers. No changes were observed in warfarin plasma protein binding. Glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the pharmacodynamic response to warfarin.

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1). Nursing Mothers Discontinue glimepiride or nursing taking into consideration the importance of glimepiride to the mother (8.3). Pediatric Patients Not recommended because of adverse effects on body weight and hypoglycemia (8.4). Geriatric or Renally Impaired Patients At risk for hypoglycemia with glimepiride. Use caution in dose selection and titration, and monitor closely (8.5, 8.6). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of glimepiride in pregnant women. In animal studies there was no increase in congenital anomalies, but an increase in fetal deaths occurred in rats and rabbits at glimepiride doses 50 times (rats) and 0.1 times (rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (based on body surface area). This fetotoxicity, observed only at doses inducing maternal hypoglycemia, is believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glimepiride and has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas. Glimepiride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Because data suggest that abnormal blood glucose during pregnancy is associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> treatment during pregnancy should maintain blood glucose as close to normal as possible. Nonteratogenic Effects Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether glimepiride tablets are excreted in human milk. During pre and postnatal studies in rats, significant concentrations of glimepiride were present in breast milk and the serum of the pups. Offspring of rats exposed to high levels of glimepiride during pregnancy and lactation developed skeletal deformities consisting of shortening, thickening, and bending of the humerus during the postnatal period. These skeletal deformations were determined to be the result of nursing from mothers exposed to glimepiride. Based on these animal data and the potential for hypoglycemia in a nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue glimepiride, taking into account the importance of glimepiride to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of glimepiride have been evaluated in pediatric patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> as described below. Glimepiride tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients because of its adverse effects on body weight and hypoglycemia. The pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg single dose of glimepiride was evaluated in 30 patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> (male  7 female  23) between ages 10 and 17 years. The mean ( SD) AUC(0last) (339203 nghrmL), Cmax (10248 ngmL) and t12 (3.11.7 hours) for glimepiride were comparable to historical data from adults (AUC(0last) 31596 nghrmL, Cmax 10334 ngmL and t12 5.34.1 hours). The safety and efficacy of glimepiride in pediatric patients was evaluated in a singleblind, 24week trial that randomized 272 patients (8 to 17 years of age) with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> to glimepiride (n135) or metformin (n137). Both treatmentnave patients (those treated with only diet and exercise for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization) and previously treated patients (those previously treated or currently treated with other oral antidiabetic medications for at least 3 months) were eligible to participate. Patients who were receiving oral antidiabetic agents at the time of study entry discontinued these medications before randomization without a washout period. Glimepiride was initiated at 1 mg, and then titrated up to 2, 4 or 8 mg (mean last dose 4 mg) through Week 12, targeting a selfmonitored fasting fingerstick blood glucose  126 mgdL. Metformin was initiated at 500 mg twice daily and titrated at Week 12 up to 1000 mg twice daily (mean last dose 1365 mg). After 24 weeks, the overall mean treatment difference in HbA1c between glimepiride and metformin was 0.2, favoring metformin (95 confidence interval 0.3 to 0.6). Based on these results, the trial did not meet its primary objective of showing a similar reduction in HbA1c with glimepiride compared to metformin. Table 2.

Hypoglycemic events documented by blood glucose values 36 mgdL were observed in 4 of pediatric patients treated with glimepiride and in 1 of pediatric patients treated with metformin. One patient in each treatment group experienced a severe hypoglycemic episode (severity was determined by the investigator based on observed signs and symptoms). 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical trials of glimepiride, 1053 of 3491 patients (30) were 65 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. There were no significant differences in glimepiride pharmacokinetics between patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> 65 years (n49) and those 65 years (n42) see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Glimepiride is substantially excreted by the kidney. Elderly patients are more likely to have renal impairment. In addition, hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Use caution when initiating glimepiride and increasing the dose of glimepiride tablets in this patient population. 8.6 Renal Impairment To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, the recommended starting dose of glimepiride tablets are 1 mg daily for all patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> and renal impairment see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). A multipledose titration study was conducted in 16 patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> and renal impairment using doses ranging from 1 mg to 8 mg daily for 3 months. Baseline creatinine clearance ranged from 10 to 60 mLmin. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride tablets were evaluated in the multipledose titration study and the results were consistent with those observed in patients enrolled in a singledose study. In both studies, the relative total clearance of glimepiride increased when kidney function was impaired. Both studies also demonstrated that the elimination of the two major metabolites was reduced in patients with renal impairment see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).</td></tr>

In mice, administration of glimepiride for 24 months resulted in an increase in benign pancreatic adenoma formation that was doserelated and was thought to be the result of chronic pancreatic stimulation. No adenoma formation in mice was observed at a dose of 320 ppm in complete feed, or 46 to 54 mgkg body weightday. This is about 35 times the maximum human recommended dose of 8 mg once daily based on surface area.

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypoglycemia May be severe. Ensure proper patient selection, dosing, and instructions, particularly in atrisk populations (e.g., elderly, renally impaired) and when used with other antidiabetic medications (5.1). Hypersensitivity Reactions Postmarketing reports include anaphylaxis, angioedema and StevensJohnson Syndrome. Promptly discontinue glimepiride, assess for other causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> (5.2). Hemolytic Anemia Can occur if glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient. Consider a nonsulfonylurea alternative. (5.3). Potential Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas Inform patient of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives (5.4). Macrovascular Outcomes No clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glimepiride or any other antidiabetic drug (5.5). 5.1 Hypoglycemia All sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, can cause severe hypoglycemia see Adverse Reactions (6.1). The patients ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Use caution when initiating and increasing glimepiride tablets doses in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other antidiabetic medications). Debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucoselowering medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking betaadrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with glimepiride, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and StevensJohnson Syndrome. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue glimepiride, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b>. 5.3 Hemolytic Anemia Sulfonylureas can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Because glimepiride tablets are a sulfonylurea, use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency and consider the use of a nonsulfonylurea alternative. There are also postmarketing reports of hemolytic anemia in patients receiving glimepiride who did not have known G6PD deficiency see Adverse Reactions (6.2). 5.4 Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> Program (UGDP), a longterm, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucoselowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with noninsulindependent <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b>. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 212 times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glimepiride and of alternative modes of therapy. Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure. 5.5 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glimepiride or any other antidiabetic drug."</td></tr>

These skeletal deformations were determined to be the result of nursing from mothers exposed to glimepiride. Based on these animal data and the potential for hypoglycemia in a nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue glimepiride, taking into account the importance of glimepiride to the mother.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 304 patients with type 2 <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> already treated with sulfonylurea therapy participated in a 14week, multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of glimepiride monotherapy. Patients discontinued their sulfonylurea therapy then entered a 3week placebo washout period followed by randomization into 1 of 4 treatment groups placebo (n74), glimepiride tablets 1 mg (n78), glimepiride tablets 4 mg (n76) and glimepiride tablets 8 mg (n76). All patients randomized to glimepiride tablets started 1 mg daily. Patients randomized to glimepiride tablets 4 mg or 8 mg had blinded, forced titration of the glimepiride tablets dose at weekly intervals, first to 4 mg and then to 8 mg, as long as the dose was tolerated, until the randomized dose was reached. Patients randomized to the 4 mg dose reached the assigned dose at Week 2. Patients randomized to the 8 mg dose reached the assigned dose at Week 3. Once the randomized dose level was reached, patients were to be maintained at that dose until Week 14. Approximately 66 of the placebotreated patients completed the trial compared to 81 of patients treated with glimepiride 1 mg and 92 of patients treated with glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg. Compared to placebo, treatment with glimepiride tablets 1 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg daily provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1C compared to placebo (Table 3).

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and desmopressin acetate injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency andor hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, since these patients may develop hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate.

Nursing Mothers There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Central <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> Insipidus Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> insipidus for periods up to 44 months.

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication andor hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient andor guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use.) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia headache, nauseavomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following seizure, coma andor respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Central <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> Insipidus The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablets therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use.) Adults and Children It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (12 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> insipidus patients. Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use.) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> Insipidus Dose response studies in patients with <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma halflife of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t12 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5 compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16 compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate (desmopressin acetate Nasal Spray and desmopressin acetate Rhinal Tube). Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four longterm studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers (SE)  Standard error of the mean Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsmkg 0.1 mg PO q8h 3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h 4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h 4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h 4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90 confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95 and 110 and 84 to 99 of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an intersubject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12hour period. Ten fluidcontrolled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg.

At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mLmin and urine osmolality was 500 mOsmkg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of selftitration from spray to tablets, patients diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis Two doubleblind, randomized, placebocontrolled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 517 years old, and 72 were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a twoweek baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 414). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights2 Weeks Placebo (n85) 0.2 mgday (n79) 0.4 mgday (n82) 0.6 mgday (n83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10(0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10 27 30 40 pvalue vs. placebo  0.05 0.05 0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebotreated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, openlabel extension study, patients completing the placebocontrolled studies were started on 0.2 mgday desmopressin acetate tablets, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mgday). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy the average number of wet nights2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 414), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twentyfive (25) patients (11) achieved a complete or near complete response (2 wet nights2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mgday dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56) showed at least a 50 reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights2 weeks, while 87 (38) patients achieved a complete or near complete response.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation made at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction. If isoniazid therapy must be reinstituted, the drug should be given only after symp toms have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent hypersensitivity reaction. Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following Daily users of alcohol. Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of  isoniazid hepatitis. Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction. Age  35. Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication. History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid. Existence of peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy. Pregnancy. Injection drug use. Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the postpartum period. HIV seropositive patients. Laboratory Tests Because there is a higher frequency of isoniazid associated hepatitis among certain patient groups, including Age  35, daily users of alcohol, chronic liver disease, injection drug use and women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the postpartum period, transaminase measurements should be obtained prior to starting and monthly during preventative therapy, or more frequently as needed. If any of the values exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, isoniazid should be temporarily discontinued and consideration given to restarting therapy. Drug Interactions Food Isoniazid should not be administered with food. Studies have shown that the bioavailability of isoniazid is reduced significantly when administered with food. Acetaminophen A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving isoniazid. It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between isoniazid and acetaminophen and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed. However, current evidence suggests that isoniazid does induce P450IIE1, a mixedfunction oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites, in the liver. Furthermore it has been proposed that isoniazid resulted in induction of P450IIE1 in the patients liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested acetaminophen being converted to the toxic metabolites. Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with isoniazid potentiates acetaminophen heaptoxicity in rats 1,2. Carbamazepine Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels. Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isonia zid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and ap propriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made3. Ketoconazole Potential interaction of ketoconazole and isoniazid may exist. When ketoconazole is given in combination with isoniazid and rifampin the AUC of ketoconazole is decreased by as much as 88 after 5 months of concurrent isoniazid and rifampin therapy 4. Phenytoin Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin. To avoid phenytoin intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made5,6. Theophylline A recent study has shown that concomitant administration of isoniazid and theophylline may cause elevated plasma levels of theophylline, and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of isoniazid. Since the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow, theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made7. Valproate A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of valproate when coadministered with isoniazid. Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isonia zid and valproate are coadministered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made5. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Isoniazid has been shown to induce pulmonary tumors in a number of strains of mice. Isoniazid has not been shown to be carcinogenic in humans.

Nonteratogenic Effects Since isoniazid is known to cross the placenta barrier, neonates of isoniazidtreated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects. Nursing Mothers The small concentrations of isoniazid in breast milk do not produce toxicity in the nursing newborn therefore, breastfeeding should not be discouraged. However, because levels of isoniazid are so low in breast milk, they can not be relied upon for prophylaxis or therapy of nursing infants.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE Isoniazid is recommended for all forms of tuberculos in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant antituberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Singledrug treatment of active tuberculos with isoniazid, or any other medication, is inadequate therapy. Isoniazid is recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis) 1. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection ( 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy. 2. Close contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis ( 5 mm). In addition, tuberculinnegative ( 5mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of in fectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive ( 5 mm), therapy should be continued. 3. Recent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test ( 10 mm increase within a 2year period for those  35 years old  15 mm increase for those  35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a  10 mm skin test are included in this category. 4. Persons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis ( 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. 5. Intravenous drug users known to be HIVseronegative ( 10 mm). 6. Persons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis ( 10 mm) silicosis <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> mellitus prolonged therapy with adrenocorti costeroids immunosuppressive therapy some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkins disease endstage renal disease clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic under nutrition (including intestinal bypass surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state (with or without weight loss), chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. Additionally, in the absence of any of the above risk factors, persons under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are also appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they are a member of any of the following highincidence groups Foreignborn persons from highprevalence countries who never received BCG vaccine. Medically under served lowincome populations, including highrisk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Residents of facilities for longterm care (e.g., correctional institutions, nursing homes, and mental institutions). Children who are less than 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have  10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test. Finally, persons under the age of 35 who a) have none of the above risk factors (16) b) belong to none of the highincidence groups and c) have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more, are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy. The risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactors over the age of 35. However, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above (16) and on an individual basis insituations where there is likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Repackaged By  Aidarex Pharmaceuticals LLC, Corona, CA 92880 Warning Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid therapy has been re ported and may occur or may develop even after many months of treatment. The risk of developing hepatitis is age related. Approximate case rates by age are less than 1 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 2034 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 3549 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 5064 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age. The risk of hepatitis is increased with daily consumption of alcohol. Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazidrelated hepatitis is not available however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study in volving 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 deaths among 174 cases of hepatitis. Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals. For persons 35 and older, in addition to monthly symptom reviews, hepatic enzymes (specifically, AST and ALT (formerly SGOT and SGPT, respectively)) should be measured prior to starting isoniazid therapy and periodically throughout treatment. Isoniazidassociated hepatitis usually occurs during the first three months of treatment. Usually, enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs. Other factors associated with an increased risk of hepatitis include daily use of alcohol, chronic liver disease and injection drug use. A recent report suggests an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid among women, particularly black and Hispanic women. The risk may also be increased during the post partum period. More careful monitoring should be considered in these groups, possibly including more frequent laboratory monitoring. If abnor malities of liver function exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontin uation of isoniazid should be strongly considered. Liver function tests are not a substitute for a clinical evaluation at monthly intervals or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions occurring between regularly scheduled evaluations. Patients should be instructed to immediately report signs or symptoms consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects. These include any of the following unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever of greater than 3 days duration andor abdominal tenderness, especially right upper quadrant discomfort. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of liver damage. Patients with tuberculosis who have hepatitis attributed to isoniazid should be given appro priate treatment with alternative drugs. If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinsti tuted only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immedi ately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement. Preventive treatment should be deferred in persons with acute hepatic diseases.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>microbiology</i>:</td><td>Microbiology Two standardized in vitro susceptibility methods are available for testing isoniazid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. The agar proportion method (CDC or NCCLS M24P) utilizes middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at two final concentrations, 0.2 and 0.1 mcgmL. MIC99 values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures. Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug  1 of the control indicates resistance. The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcgmL of isoniazid. Strict adherence to the manufacturers instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with an MIC99  0.2 mcgmL are considered to be susceptible to isoniazid. Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods discussed above cannot be compared unless equivalent drug concentrations are evaluated. The clinical relevance of in vitro susceptibility for mycobacterium species other than M. tuberculos is using either the BACTEC or the proportion method has not been determined.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent reactions are those affecting the nervous system and the liver. Nervous System Reactions Peripheral neuropathy is the most common toxic effect. It is doserelated, occurs most often in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuritis (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics), and is usually preceded by paresthesias of the feet and hands. The incidence is higher in "slow inactivators". Other neurotoxic effects, which are uncommon with conventional doses, are convulsions, toxic encephalopathy, optic neuritis and atrophy, memory impairment, and toxic psychosis. Hepatic Reactions See boxed warning. Elevated serum transaminase (SGOT SGPT), bilirubinemia, bilirubinuria, jaundice, and occasionally severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis. The common prodromal symp toms of hepatitis are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, and weakness. Mild hepatic dysfunction, evidenced by mild and transient elevation of serum transaminase levels occurs in 10 to 20 percent of patients taking isoniazid. This abnormality usually appears in the first 1 to 3 months of treatment but can occur at any time during therapy. In most instances, enzyme levels return to normal, and generally, there is no necessity to discontinue medication during the period of mild serum transaminase elevation. In occasional instances, progressive liver damage occurs, with accompanying symptoms. If the SGOT value exceeds three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of the isoniazid should be strongly considered. The frequency of progres sive liver damage increases with age. It is rare in persons under 20, but occurs in up to 2.3 percent of those over 50 years of age. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric distress. Hematologic Reactions Agranulocytosis hemolytic, sideroblastic, or aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia. Hypersensitivity Reactions Fever, skin eruptions (morbilliform, maculopapular, purpuric, or exfoliative), lymphadenopathy, and vasculitis.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (See also INDICATIONS0.)  NOTE  For preventive therapy of tuberculous infection and treatment of tuberculosis, it is recommended that physicians be familiar with the following publications (1) the recommen dations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, published in the MMWR vol 42 RR4, 1993 and (2) Treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine vol 149 13591374, 1994. For Treatment of Tuberculosis Isoniazid is used in conjunction with other effective antituberculosis agents. Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organisms initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible. Usual Oral Dosage (depending on the regimen used) Adults 5 mgkg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose or 15 mgkg up to 900 mgday, two or three timesweek Children 10  15 mgkg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose or 2040 mgkg up to 900 mgday, two or three timesweek Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Without HIV Infection There are 3 regimen options for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in children and adults Option 1 Daily isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 16 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin daily or 2 to 3 times weekly. Ethambutol or streptomycin should be added to the initial regimen until sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin is demonstrated. The addition of a fourth drug is optional if the relative prevalence of isoniazidresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the community is less than or equal to four percent. Option 2 Daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin or ethambutol for 2 weeks followed by twice weekly administration of the same drugs for 6 weeks, subsequently twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin for 16 weeks. Option 3 Three times weekly with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin for 6 months.  All regimen given twice weekly or 3 times weekly should be administered by directly observed therapy (see also Directly Observed Therapy). The above treatment guidelines apply only when the disease is caused by organisms that are sus ceptible to the standard antituberculous agents. Because of the impact of resistance to isoniazid and rifampin on the response to therapy, it is essential that physicians initiating therapy for tu berculosis be familiar with the prevalence of drug resistance in their communities. It is suggested that ethambutol not be used in children whose visual acuity cannot be monitored. Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis and HIV Infection The response of the immunologically impaired host to treatment may not be as satisfactory as that of a person with normal host responsiveness. For this reason, therapeutic decisions for the impaired host must be individualized. Since patients coinfected with HIV may have problems with malabsorption, screening of antimycobacterial drug levels, especially in patients with ad vanced HIV disease, may be necessary to prevent the emergence of MDRTB. Patients with Extra Pulmonary Tuberculosis The basic principles that underlie the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis also apply to Extra pulmonary forms of the disease. Although there have not been the same kinds of carefully conducted controlled trials of treatment of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis as for pulmonary disease, increasing clinical experience indicates that a 6 to 9 month shortcourse regimen is effective. Because of the insufficient data, military tuberculosis, bonejoint tuberculosis, and tuberculous meningitis in infants and children should receive 12 month therapy. Bacteriologic evaluation of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis may be limited by the relative in accessibility of the sites of disease. Thus, response to treatment often must be judged on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings. The use of adjunctive therapies such as surgery and corticosteroids is more commonly required in Extra pulmonary tuberculosis than in pulmonary disease. Surgery may be necessary to obtain specimens for diagnosis and to treat such processes as constrictive pericarditis and spinal cord compression from Potts Disease. Corticosteroids have been shown to be of benefit in preventing cardiac constriction from tuberculous pericarditis and in decreasing the neurologic sequelae of all stages of tuberculosis meningitis, especially when administered early in the course of the disease. Pregnant Women with Tuberculosis The options listed above must be adjusted for the pregnant patient. Streptomycin interferes with in utero development of the ear and may cause congenital deafness. Routine use of pyrazinamide is also not recommended in pregnancy because of inadequate teratogenicity data. The initial treatment regimen should consist of isoniazid and rifampin. Ethambutol should be included unless primary isoniazid resistance is unlikely (isoniazid resistance rate documented to be less than 4). Treatment of Patients with MultiDrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) Multipledrug resistant tuberculosis (i.e., resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) presents difficult treatment problems. Treatment must be individualized and based on susceptibility studies. In such cases, consultation with an expert in tuberculosis is recommended. Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) A major cause of drugresistant tuberculosis is patient noncompliance with treatment. The use of DOT can help assure patient compliance with drug therapy. DOT is the observation of the pa tient by a health care provider or other responsible person as the patient ingests antituberculosis medications. DOT can be achieved with daily, twice weekly or thrice weekly regimens, and is recommended for all patients. For Preventative Therapy of Tuberculosis Before isoniazid preventive therapy is initiated, bacteriologically positive or radiographically progressive tuberculosis must be excluded. Appropriate evaluations should be performed if Extra pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected. Adults over 30 Kg 300 mg per day in a single dose. Infants and Children 10 mgkg (up to 300 mg daily) in a single dose. In situations where adherence with daily preventative therapy cannot be assured, 2030 mgkg (not to exceed 900 mg) twice weekly under the direct observation of a health care worker at the time of admin istration8. Continuous administration of isoniazid for a sufficient period is an essential part of the regimen because relapse rates are higher if chemotherapy is stopped prematurely. In the treatment of tu berculosis, resistant organisms may multiply and the emergence of resistant organisms during the treatment may necessitate a change in the regimen. For following patient compliance the PottsCozart test9, a simple colorimetric6 method of checking for isoniazid in the urine, is a useful tool for assuring patient compliance, which is essential for effective tuberculosis control. Additionally, isoniazid test strips are also available to check patient compliance. Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B6) is recommended in malnourished and in those predisposed to neuropathy (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Within 1 to 2 hours after oral administration, isoniazid produces peak blood levels which decline to 50 percent or less within 6 hours. It diffuses readily into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic fluids), tissues, organs, and excreta (saliva, sputum, and feces). The drug also passes through the placental barrier and into milk in concentrations comparable to those in the plasma. From 50 to 70 percent of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine within 24 hours. Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. Approximately 50 percent of Blacks and Caucasians are "slow inacti vators", and the rest are "rapid inactivators" the majority of Eskimos and Orientals are" rapid inactivators." The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid. However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood levels of the drug and, thus, to an increase in toxic reactions. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency is sometimes observed in adults with high doses of isoniazid and is considered probably due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase. Mechanism of Action Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacteri al cell wall. At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intra cellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. Isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli develop rapidly when isoniazid monotherapy is administered. Microbiology Two standardized in vitro susceptibility methods are available for testing isoniazid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. The agar proportion method (CDC or NCCLS M24P) utilizes middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at two final concentrations, 0.2 and 0.1 mcgmL. MIC99 values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures. Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug  1 of the control indicates resistance. The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcgmL of isoniazid. Strict adherence to the manufacturers instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with an MIC99  0.2 mcgmL are considered to be susceptible to isoniazid. Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods discussed above cannot be compared unless equivalent drug concentrations are evaluated. The clinical relevance of in vitro susceptibility for mycobacterium species other than M. tuberculos is using either the BACTEC or the proportion method has not been determined.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>Warning Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid therapy has been re ported and may occur or may develop even after many months of treatment. The risk of developing hepatitis is age related. Approximate case rates by age are less than 1 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 2034 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 3549 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 5064 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age. The risk of hepatitis is increased with daily consumption of alcohol. Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazidrelated hepatitis is not available however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study in volving 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 deaths among 174 cases of hepatitis. Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals. For persons 35 and older, in addition to monthly symptom reviews, hepatic enzymes (specifically, AST and ALT (formerly SGOT and SGPT, respectively)) should be measured prior to starting isoniazid therapy and periodically throughout treatment. Isoniazidassociated hepatitis usually occurs during the first three months of treatment. Usually, enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs. Other factors associated with an increased risk of hepatitis include daily use of alcohol, chronic liver disease and injection drug use. A recent report suggests an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid among women, particularly black and Hispanic women. The risk may also be increased during the post partum period. More careful monitoring should be considered in these groups, possibly including more frequent laboratory monitoring. If abnor malities of liver function exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontin uation of isoniazid should be strongly considered. Liver function tests are not a substitute for a clinical evaluation at monthly intervals or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions occurring between regularly scheduled evaluations. Patients should be instructed to immediately report signs or symptoms consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects. These include any of the following unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever of greater than 3 days duration andor abdominal tenderness, especially right upper quadrant discomfort. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of liver damage. Patients with tuberculosis who have hepatitis attributed to isoniazid should be given appro priate treatment with alternative drugs. If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinsti tuted only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immedi ately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement. Preventive treatment should be deferred in persons with acute hepatic diseases.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms Isoniazid overdosage produces signs and symptoms within 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, slurring of speech, blurring of vision, and visual hallucinations (including bright colors and strange designs) are among the early manifestations. With marked overdosage, respiratory distress and CNS depression, progressing rapidly from stupor to profound coma, are to be expected, along with severe, intractable seizures. Severe metabolic acidosis, acetonuria, and hyperglycemia are typical laboratory findings. Treatment Untreated or inadequately treated cases of gross isoniazid overdosage, 80 mgkg  150 mgkg, can cause neurotoxicity6 and terminate fatally, but good response has been reported in most patients brought under adequate treatment within the first few hours after drug ingestion. For the Asymptomatic Patient Absorption of drugs from the GI tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal. Gastric emptying should also be employed in the asymptomatic patient. Safeguard the patients airway when employing these procedures. Patients who acutely ingest  80 mgkg should be treated with intravenous pyridoxine on a gram per gram basis equal to the isoniazid dose. If an unknown amount of isoniazid is ingested, consider an initial dose of 5 grams of pyridoxine given over 30 to 60 minutes in adults, or 80 mgkg of pyridoxine in children. For the Symptomatic Patient Ensure adequate ventilation, support cardiac output, and protect the airway while treating seizures and attempting to limit absorption. If the dose of isoniazid is known, the patient should be treated initially with a slow intravenous bolus of pyridoxine, over 3 to 5 minutes, on a gram per gram basis, equal to the isoniazid dose. If the quantity of isoniazid ingestion is unknown, then consider an initial intravenous bolus of pyridoxine of 5 grams in the adult or 80 mgkg in the child. If seizures continue, the dosage of pyridoxine may be repeated. It would be rare that more than 10 grams of pyridoxine would need to be given. The maximum safe dose for pyridoxine in isoniazid intoxication is not known. If the patient does not respond to pyridoxine, diazepam may be ad ministered. Phenytoin should be used cautiously, because isoniazid interferes with the metabo lism of phenytoin. General Obtain blood samples for immediate determination of gases, electrolytes, BUN, glucose, etc. type and crossmatch blood in preparation for possible hemodialysis. Rapid Control of Metabolic Acidosis Patients with this degree of INH intoxication are likely to have hypoventilation. The ad ministration of sodium bicarbonate under these circumstances can cause exacerbation of hypercarbia. Ventilation must be monitored carefully, by measuring blood carbon dioxide levels, and supported mechanically, if there is respiratory insufficiency. Dialysis Both peritoneal and hemodialysis have been used in the management of isoniazid overdosage. These procedures are probably not required if control of seizures and acidosis is achieved with pyridoxine, diazepam and bicarbonate. Along with measures based on initial and repeated determination of blood gases and other laboratory tests as needed, utilize meticulous respiratory and other intensive care to protect against hypoxia, hypotension, aspiration, pneumonitis, etc.</td></tr>

Isoniazid should be used as a treatment for active tuberculosis during pregnancy because the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The benefit of preventative therapy also should be weighed against a possible risk to the fetus. Preventive therapy generally should be started after delivery to prevent putting the fetus at risk of exposure the low levels of isoniazid in breast milk do not threaten the neonate. Since isoniazid is known to cross the placenta barrier, neonates of isoniazid treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>SPL UNCLASSIFIED Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have saltretaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their potent antiinflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the bodys immune responses to diverse stimuli.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (See ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic Reactions ). Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during and after the stressful situation. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients. Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamicpituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for corticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids and may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for up to 12 months after discontinuation of therapy therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. If the patient is receiving steroids already, dosage may have to be increased. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. General Patients who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infection with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic) in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents that affect cellular immunity, humoral immunity, or neutrophil function.1 These infections may be mild, but may be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases.2 Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of current infection. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections unless they are needed to control lifethreatening drug reactions. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (See PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions  Amphotericin B Injection and PotassiumDepleting Agents). Special Pathogens Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Amoeba, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma. It is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or any patient with unexplained diarrhea. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroidinduced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia. Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral malaria. Tuberculosis The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines may be diminished and cannot be predicted. Indicated immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids as replacement therapy (e.g., for Addisons disease). Viral Infections Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease andor prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Ophthalmic Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Gastric irritation may be reduced if taken before, during, or immediately after meals or with food or milk. The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocorticoid activity the least when given at the time of maximal activity (am) for single dose administration. Therefore, it is recommended that prednisone be administered in the morning prior to 9 am and when large doses are given, administration of antacids between meals to help prevent peptic ulcers. Multiple dose therapy should be evenly distributed in evenly spaced intervals throughout the day. Dietary salt restriction may be advisable in patients. Do not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your doctor. Avoid abrupt withdraw of therapy. The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small increments at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patients individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment in this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patients condition. If after longterm therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring longterm pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitaryadrenal suppression, the cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises (a) the antiinflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for reestablishment of more nearly normal hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) activity on the offsteroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushings disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b>, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during longterm pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1 14 to 1 12 days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy 1. Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of alternate day therapy should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2. Alternate day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom longterm pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate day therapy. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available (a) change to alternate day therapy and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4. Because of the advantages of alternate day therapy, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on alternate day therapy may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6. The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7. In using alternate day therapy it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of alternate day therapy will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flareup in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the offsteroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8. In the event of an acute flareup of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be reinstituted. 9. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by alternate day therapy, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefitrisk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a riskbenefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Kaposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement. As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency. Druginduced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for up to 12 months after discontinuation of therapy following large doses for prolonged periods therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt andor a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism. Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of osteoporosis at any age. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy. Inclusion of therapy for osteoporosis prevention or treatment should be considered. To minimize the risk of glucocorticoidinduced bone loss, the smallest possible effective dosage and duration should be used. Lifestyle modification to reduce the risk of osteoporosis (e.g., cigarette smoking cessation, limitation of alcohol consumption, participation in weightbearing exercise for 3060 minutes daily) should be encouraged. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation, bisphosphonate (e.g., alendronate, risedronate), and a weightbearing exercise program that maintains muscle mass are suitable firstline therapies aimed at reducing the risk of adverse bone effects. Current recommendations suggest that all interventions be initiated in any patient in whom glucocorticoid therapy with at least the equivalent of 5 mg of prednisone for at least 3 months is anticipated in addition, sex hormone replacement therapy (combined estrogen and progestin in women testosterone in men) should be offered to such patients who are hypogonadal or in whom replacement is otherwise clinically indicated and biphosphonate therapy should be initiated (if not already) if bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine andor hip is below normal. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Multiple Sclerosis .) An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatinine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years. Psychiatric derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored. Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly or without medical supervision. As prolonged use may cause adrenal insufficiency and make patients dependent on corticosteroids, they should advise any medical attendants that they are taking corticosteroids and they should seek medical advice at once should they develop an acute illness including fever or other signs of infection. Following prolonged therapy, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in symptoms of the corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome including, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise. Persons who are on corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay. Amphotericin B Injection and PotassiumDepleting Agents When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassiumdepleting agents (e.g., amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia. In addition, there have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure. Antibiotics Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance (See PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates). Anticholinesterases Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents (e.g., neostigmine, pyridostigmine) and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy. If concomitant therapy must occur, it should take place under close supervision and the need for respiratory support should be anticipated. Anticoagulants, Oral Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect. Antidiabetics Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required. Antitubercular Drugs Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased. Bupropion Since systemic steroids, as well as bupropion, can lower the seizure threshold, concurrent administration should be undertaken only with extreme caution low initial dosing and small gradual increases should be employed. Cholestyramine Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids. Cyclosporine Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use. Digitalis Glycosides Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia. Estrogens, Including Oral Contraceptives Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect. Fluoroquinolones Postmarketing surveillance reports indicate that the risk of tendon rupture may be increased in patients receiving concomitant fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) and corticosteroids, especially in the elderly. Tendon rupture can occur during or after treatment with quinolones. Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased. Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids are moderate inducers of CYP 3A4. Coadministration with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g., indinavir, erythromycin) may increase their clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60, leading to increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. In addition, ketoconazole alone can inhibit adrenal corticosteroid synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal. Nonsteroidal AntiInflammatory Agents (NSAIDS) Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids this could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn. Phenytoin In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in phenytoin levels with dexamethasone coadministration, leading to alterations in seizure control. Phenytoin has been demonstrated to increase the hepatic metabolism of corticosteroids, resulting in a decreased therapeutic effect of the corticosteroid. Quetiapine Increased doses of quetiapine may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving a glucocorticoid, a hepatic enzyme inducer. Skin Tests Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests. Thalidomide Coadministration with thalidomide should be employed cautiously, as toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported with concomitant use. Vaccines Patients on corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (See WARNINGS Infection Vaccination). No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether corticosteroids have a potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis. Steroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermatozoa in some patients. Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in many species when given in doses equivalent to the human dose. Animal studies in which corticosteroids have been given to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have yielded an increased incidence of cleft palate in the offspring. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from corticosteroids, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the wellestablished course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (patients 2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (patients 1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and wellcontrolled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations. The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In particular, the increased risk of <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> mellitus, fluid retention and hypertension in elderly patients treated with corticosteroids should be considered.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>laboratory_tests</i>:</td><td>Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test Female patients of childbearing potential must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIUmL before receiving the initial Amnesteem prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Amnesteem. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIAcertified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIAcertified laboratory, prior to the female patient receiving each prescription. Lipids Pretreatment and followup blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Amnesteem is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on Amnesteem therapy (see WARNINGS Lipids). Liver Function Tests Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and followup liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to Amnesteem has been established (see WARNINGS Hepatotoxicity). Glucose Some patients receiving Amnesteem have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> have been diagnosed during Amnesteem therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on Amnesteem therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12 of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mgkgday (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor therefore, the relevance of this tumor to the human population is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative while in the second laboratory a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 x background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No doseresponse effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with humanderived lymphocytes and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8 or 32 mgkgday (0.3, 1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mgkgday (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. In studies of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving Amnesteem (isotretinoin) therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of Amnesteem under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high fat meal when compared with Amnesteem given under fasted conditions (see Table 2 ). The observed elimination halflife was unchanged. This lack of change in halflife suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (Tmax) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, Amnesteem capsules should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects with normal skin. Table 2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Mean (CV), N  74 Amnesteem 2 x 40 mg Capsules AUC0 (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) t12 (hr) Fed 10,004 (22) 862 (22) 5.3 (77) 21 (39) Fasted 3,703 (46) 301 (63) 3.2 (56) 21 (30) Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9 bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Metabolism Following oral administration of isotretinoin, at least three metabolites have been identified in human plasma 4oxoisotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4oxoretinoic acid (4oxotretinoin). Retinoic acid and 13cisretinoic acid are geometric isomers and show reversible interconversion. The administration of one isomer will give rise to the other. Isotretinoin is also irreversibly oxidized to 4oxoisotretinoin, which forms its geometric isomer 4oxotretinoin. After a single 80 mg oral dose of Amnesteem to 74 healthy adult subjects, concurrent administration of food increased the extent of formation of all metabolites in plasma when compared to the extent of formation under fasted conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity that is in some in vitro models more than that of the parent isotretinoin. However, the clinical significance of these models is unknown. After multiple oral dose administration of isotretinoin to adult cystic acne patients ( 18 years), the exposure of patients to 4oxoisotretinoin at steadystate under fasted and fed conditions was approximately 3.4 times higher than that of isotretinoin. In vitro studies indicate that the primary P450 isoforms involved in isotretinoin metabolism are 2C8, 2C9, 3A4 and 2B6. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates, which are then excreted in urine and feces. Elimination Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of 14Cisotretinoin as a liquid suspension, 14Cactivity in blood declined with a halflife of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and any conjugates are ultimately excreted in the feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65 to 83). After a single 80 mg oral dose of Amnesteem to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean  SD elimination halflives (t12) of isotretinoin and 4oxoisotretinoin were 21  8.2 hours and 24  5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.9 to 5.43 in patients with cystic acne.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS Amnesteem must only be prescribed by prescribers who are registered and activated with the iPLEDGE program. Amnesteem must only be dispensed by a pharmacy registered and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are registered and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE. Registered and activated pharmacies must receive Amnesteem only from wholesalers registered with iPLEDGE. iPLEDGE program requirements for wholesalers, prescribers and pharmacists are described below Wholesalers For the purpose of the iPLEDGE program, the term wholesaler refers to wholesaler, distributor andor chain pharmacy distributor. To distribute Amnesteem, wholesalers must be registered with iPLEDGE and agree to meet all iPLEDGE requirements for wholesale distribution of isotretinoin products. Wholesalers must register with iPLEDGE by signing and returning the iPLEDGE wholesaler agreement that affirms they will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements for distribution of isotretinoin. These include Registering prior to distributing isotretinoin and reregistering annually thereafter Distributing only FDA approved isotretinoin product Only shipping isotretinoin to wholesalers registered in the iPLEDGE program with prior written consent from the manufacturer or pharmacies licensed in the US and registered and activated in the iPLEDGE program Notifying the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) of any nonregistered andor nonactivated pharmacy or unregistered wholesaler that attempts to order isotretinoin Complying with inspection of wholesaler records for verification of compliance with the iPLEDGE program by the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) Returning to the manufacturer (or delegate) any undistributed product if registration is revoked by the manufacturer or if the wholesaler chooses to not reregister annually Prescribers To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must be registered and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. Prescribers can register by signing and returning the completed registration form. Prescribers can only activate their registration by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points I know the risk and severity of fetal injurybirth defects from isotretinoin. I know the risk factors for unplanned pregnancy and the effective measures for avoidance of unplanned pregnancy. I have the expertise to provide the patient with detailed pregnancy prevention counseling or I will refer her to an expert for such counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer. I will comply with the iPLEDGE program requirements described in the booklets entitled The Guide to Best Practices for the iPLEDGE Program and The iPLEDGE Program Prescriber Contraception Counseling Guide. Before beginning treatment of female patients of child bearing potential with isotretinoin and on a monthly basis, the patient will be counseled to avoid pregnancy by using two forms of contraception simultaneously and continuously one month before, during and one month after isotretinoin therapy, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence. I will not prescribe isotretinoin to any female patient of childbearing potential until verifying she has a negative screening pregnancy test and monthly negative CLIAcertified (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment) pregnancy tests. Patients should have a pregnancy test at the completion of the entire course of isotretinoin capsules and another pregnancy test one month later. I will report any pregnancy case that I become aware of while the female patient is on isotretinoin or one month after the last dose to the pregnancy registry. To prescribe isotretinoin, the Prescriber must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (18664950654) to Register each patient in the iPLEDGE program. Confirm monthly that each patient has received counseling and education. For female patients of childbearing potential Enter patients two chosen forms of contraception each month. Enter monthly result from CLIAcertified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to female patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIAcertified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be dispensed by a pharmacy registered and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE and only when the registered patient meets all the requirements of the iPLEDGE program. Meeting the requirements for a female patient of childbearing potential signifies that she Has been counseled and has signed a Patient InformationInformed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin. The patient must sign the informed consent form before starting treatment and patient counseling must also be done at that time and on a monthly basis thereafter. Has had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIUmL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIAcertified laboratory. The interval between the two tests should be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. Has had a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIAcertified laboratory before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test must be repeated every month, in a CLIAcertified laboratory, prior to the female patient receiving each prescription. Has selected and has committed to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence from heterosexual contact, or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be postmenopausal. Patients must use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated on a monthly basis. If the patient has unprotected heterosexual intercourse at any time one month before, during or one month after therapy, she must Stop taking Amnesteem immediately, if on therapy Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected heterosexual intercourse Start using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously again for one month before resuming Amnesteem therapy Have a second pregnancy test after using two forms of effective contraception for one month as described above depending on whether she has regular menses or not. Effective forms of contraception include both primary and secondary forms of contraception Primary forms tubal sterilization partners vasectomy intrauterine device hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, transdermal patch, injectables, implantables or vaginal ring) Secondary forms Barrier male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from female patients who have used oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patchinjectableimplantablevaginal ring hormonal birth control products these pregnancies occurred while these patients were taking Amnesteem. These reports are more frequent for female patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that female patients of childbearing potential use two effective forms of contraception simultaneously. Patients must receive written warnings about the rates of possible contraception failure (included in patient education kits). Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances that a female will become pregnant over the risk of pregnancy with either form alone. A drug interaction that decreases effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives has not been entirely ruled out for Amnesteem (see PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions). Although hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to selfmedicate with the herbal supplement St. Johns Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. Johns Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. Johns Wort. If a pregnancy does occur during Amnesteem treatment, Amnesteem must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an ObstetricianGynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or one month after Amnesteem therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch number 1800FDA1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 18664950654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). All Patients Isotretinoin is contraindicated in female patients who are pregnant. To receive isotretinoin all patients must meet all of the following conditions Must be registered with the iPLEDGE program by the prescriber Must understand that severe birth defects can occur with the use of isotretinoin by female patients Must be reliable in understanding and carrying out instructions Must sign a Patient InformationInformed Consent (for all patients) form that contains warnings about the potential risks associated with isotretinoin Must fill and pick up the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test for female patients of child bearing potential Must fill and pick up the prescription within 30 days of the office visit for male patients and females patients not of child bearing potential Must not donate blood while on isotretinoin and for one month after treatment has ended Must not share isotretinoin with anyone, even someone who has similar symptoms Female Patients of Childbearing Potential Isotretinoin is contraindicated in female patients who are pregnant. In addition to the requirements for all patients described above, female patients of childbearing potential must meet the following conditions Must NOT be pregnant or breastfeeding Must comply with the required pregnancy testing at a CLIAcertified laboratory Must fill and pick up the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test Must be capable of complying with the mandatory contraceptive measures required for isotretinoin therapy, or commit to continuous abstinence from heterosexual intercourse and understand behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy Must understand that it is her responsibility to avoid pregnancy one month before, during and one month after isotretinoin therapy Must have signed an additional Patient InformationInformed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form, before starting isotretinoin, that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin Must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (18664950654), before starting isotretinoin, on a monthly basis during therapy and one month after the last dose to answer questions on the program requirements and to enter the patients two chosen forms of contraception Must have been informed of the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE program should she become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within one month of the last dose Pharmacists To dispense isotretinoin, pharmacies must be registered and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. The Responsible Site Pharmacist must register the pharmacy by signing and returning the completed registration form. After registration, the Responsible Site Pharmacist can only activate the pharmacy registration by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points I know the risk and severity of fetal injurybirth defects from isotretinoin. I will train all pharmacists, who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions, on the iPLEDGE program requirements. I will comply and seek to ensure all pharmacists who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions comply with the iPLEDGE program requirements described in the booklet entitled Pharmacist Guide for the iPLEDGE Program. I will obtain Amnesteem product only from iPLEDGE registered wholesalers. I will not sell, buy, borrow, loan or otherwise transfer isotretinoin in any manner to or from another pharmacy. I will return to the manufacturer (or delegate) any unused product if registration is revoked by the manufacturer or if the pharmacy chooses to not reactivate annually. I will not fill isotretinoin for any party other than a qualified patient. To dispense isotretinoin, the pharmacist must be trained by the Responsible Site Pharmacist concerning the iPLEDGE program requirements. obtain authorization from the iPLEDGE program via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (18664950654) for every isotretinoin prescription. Authorization signifies that the patient has met all program requirements and is qualified to receive Amnesteem. write the Risk Management Authorization (RMA) number on the prescription. Amnesteem must only be dispensed in no more than a 30 day supply with an Amnesteem Medication Guide after authorization from the iPLEDGE program prior to the do not dispense to patient after date provided by the iPLEDGE system (within 30 days of the office visit for male patients and female patients not of child bearing potential and within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for female patients of child bearing potential) with a new prescription for refills and another authorization from the iPLEDGE program (No automatic refills are allowed) An Amnesteem Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time Amnesteem is dispensed, as required by law. This Amnesteem Medication Guide is an important part of the risk management program for the patients. Amnesteem must not be prescribed, dispensed or otherwise obtained through the internet or any other means outside of the iPLEDGE program. Only FDAapproved Amnesteem products must be distributed, prescribed, dispensed and used. Patients must fill Amnesteem prescriptions only at U.S. licensed pharmacies. A description of the iPLEDGE program educational materials available with iPLEDGE is provided below. The main goal of these educational materials is to explain the iPLEDGE program requirements and to reinforce the educational messages. The Guide to Best Practices for the iPLEDGE Program includes isotretinoin teratogenic potential, information on pregnancy testing, and the method to complete a qualified Amnesteem prescription. The iPLEDGE Program Prescriber Contraception Counseling Guide includes specific information about effective contraception, the limitations of contraceptive methods, behaviors associated with an increased risk of contraceptive failure and pregnancy and the methods to evaluate pregnancy risk. The Pharmacist Guide for the iPLEDGE Program includes isotretinoin teratogenic potential and the method to obtain authorization to dispense an isotretinoin prescription. The iPLEDGE program is a systematic approach to comprehensive patient education about their responsibilities and includes education for contraception compliance and reinforcement of educational messages. The iPLEDGE program includes information on the risks and benefits of Amnesteem which is linked to the Medication Guide dispensed by pharmacists with each isotretinoin prescription. Female patients not of childbearing potential and male patients, and female patients of childbearing potential are provided with separate booklets. Each booklet contains information on isotretinoin therapy including precautions and warnings, a Patient InformationInformed Consent (for all patients) form and a tollfree line which provides isotretinoin information in two languages. The booklet for female patients not of childbearing potential and male patients, The iPLEDGE Program Guide to Isotretinoin for Male Patients and Female Patients Who Cannot Get Pregnant, also includes information about male reproduction and a warning not to share Amnesteem with others or to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for one month following discontinuation of isotretinoin. The booklet for female patients of childbearing potential, The iPLEDGE Program Guide to Isotretinoin for Female Patients Who Can Get Pregnant, includes a referral program that offers female patients free contraception counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer, by a reproductive specialist and a second Patient InformationInformed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form concerning birth defects. The booklet, The iPLEDGE Program Birth Control Workbook includes information on the types of contraceptive methods, the selection and use of appropriate, effective contraception, the rates of possible contraceptive failure and a tollfree contraception counseling line. In addition, there is a patient educational DVD with the following videosBe Prepared, Be Protected and Be Aware The Risk of Pregnancy While on Isotretinoin (see Information for Patients). General Although an effect of Amnesteem on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing Amnesteem to patients with a genetic predisposition for age related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes druginduced osteoporosisosteomalacia andor affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant. Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. There are spontaneous reports of fractures andor delayed healing in patients while on therapy with Amnesteem or following cessation of therapy with Amnesteem while involved in these activities. While causality to Amnesteem has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out. Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when Amnesteem is dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE program patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient InformationInformed Consent (for all patients) form. Female patients of childbearing potential must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when Amnesteem therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting Amnesteem, while taking Amnesteem, and for one month after Amnesteem has been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from heterosexual intercourse. They should also sign a second Patient InformationInformed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form prior to beginning Amnesteem therapy. They should be given an opportunity to view the patient DVD provided by the manufacturer to the prescriber. The DVD includes information about contraception, the most common reasons that contraception fails, and the importance of using two forms of effective contraception when taking teratogenic drugs and comprehensive information about types of potential birth defects which could occur if a female patient who is pregnant takes Amnesteem at any time during pregnancy. Female patients should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIAcertified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another Amnesteem prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Amnesteem is found in the semen of male patients taking Amnesteem, but the amount delivered to a female partner would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the noeffect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses however two of these reports were incomplete and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of Amnesteem treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop Amnesteem and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of Amnesteem treatment may be insufficient further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient andor the patients family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether Amnesteem therapy is appropriate in this setting for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of Amnesteem therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking Amnesteem or soon after stopping Amnesteem, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, anxious or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking Amnesteem have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on Amnesteem becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if Amnesteem caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take Amnesteem. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking Amnesteem. Patients must be informed that they must not share Amnesteem with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to Amnesteem. Patients should be reminded to take Amnesteem with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during Amnesteem therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Skin and Appendages). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16 of patients treated with Amnesteem in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of Amnesteem, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Musculoskeletal). There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests CPK). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29 (104358) of pediatric patients treated with Amnesteem developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5 (14104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22 (79358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6 (679) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of Amnesteem. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of Amnesteem if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Amnesteem should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (StevenJohnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in postmarketing data. Amnesteem should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur. Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. Drug Interactions Vitamin A Because of the relationship of Amnesteem to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. Tetracyclines Concomitant treatment with Amnesteem and tetracyclines should be avoided because Amnesteem use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Microdosed Progesterone Preparations Microdosed progesterone preparations (minipills that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during Amnesteem therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from female patients who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patchinjectableimplantablevaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for female patients who use only a single method of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with Amnesteem. Therefore, it is critically important for female patients of childbearing potential to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS). Norethindroneethinyl estradiol In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving OrthoNovum 777 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, Amnesteem at the recommended dose of 1 mgkgday, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. St. Johns Wort Amnesteem use is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS Psychiatric). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to selfmedicate with the herbal supplement St. Johns Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. Johns Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. Johns Wort. Phenytoin Amnesteem has not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and Amnesteem. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and Amnesteem. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test Female patients of childbearing potential must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIUmL before receiving the initial Amnesteem prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Amnesteem. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIAcertified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIAcertified laboratory, prior to the female patient receiving each prescription. Lipids Pretreatment and followup blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Amnesteem is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on Amnesteem therapy (see WARNINGS Lipids). Liver Function Tests Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and followup liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to Amnesteem has been established (see WARNINGS Hepatotoxicity). Glucose Some patients receiving Amnesteem have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> have been diagnosed during Amnesteem therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on Amnesteem therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12 of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mgkgday (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor therefore, the relevance of this tumor to the human population is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative while in the second laboratory a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 x background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No doseresponse effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with humanderived lymphocytes and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8 or 32 mgkgday (0.3, 1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mgkgday (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. In studies of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving Amnesteem (isotretinoin) therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. Pregnancy Category X See Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects, nursing mothers should not receive Amnesteem. Pediatric Use The use of Amnesteem in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age has not been studied. The use of Amnesteem for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years should be given careful consideration, especially for those patients where a known metabolic or structural bone disease exists (see PRECAUTIONS General). Use of Amnesteem in this age group for severe recalcitrant nodular acne is supported by evidence from a clinical study comparing 103 pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) to 197 adult patients ( 18 years). Results from this study demonstrated that Amnesteem, at a dose of 1 mgkgday given in two divided doses, was equally effective in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne in both pediatric and adult patients. In studies with Amnesteem, adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In an openlabel clinical trial (N  217) of a single course of therapy with Amnesteem for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change  4 and total hip change  5) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density  4 based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density  4, and all the other patients (92) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density  5 based on unadjusted data. Twenty one (10.6) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density  5, and all the other patients (89) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Followup studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range 1.6 to 7.6) in five of eight patients (62.5). In a separate openlabel extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of Amnesteem 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25 (see WARNINGS Skeletal Bone Mineral Density). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, effects of aging might be expected to increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS)."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne Amnesteem is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. Severe, by definition,2 means many as opposed to few or several nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, Amnesteem should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics. In addition, Amnesteem is indicated only for those female patients who are not pregnant, because Amnesteem can cause severe birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS). A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients.1,3,4 If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off Amnesteem. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS Skeletal Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, and Premature Epiphyseal Closure).</td></tr>

Do not sign this consent and do not take isotretinoin if there is anything that you do not understand.  A parent or guardian of a minor patient (under age 18) must also read and initial each item before signing the consent.  (Patients Name) I understand that there is a very high chance that my unborn baby could have severe birth defects if I am pregnant or become pregnant while taking isotretinoin. This can happen with any amount and even if taken for short periods of time. This is why I must not be pregnant while taking isotretinoin.Initial  I understand that I must not get pregnant one month before, during the entire time of my treatment and for one month after the end of my treatment with isotretinoin.Initial  I understand that I must avoid sexual intercourse completely, or I must use two separate, effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time. The only exceptions are if I have had surgery to remove the uterus (a hysterectomy) or both of my ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy), or my doctor has medically confirmed that I am postmenopausal. Initial  I understand that hormonal birth control products are among the most effective forms of birth control. Combination birth control pills and other hormonal products include skin patches, shots, undertheskin implants, vaginal rings and intrauterine devices (IUDs). Any form of birth control can fail. That is why I must use two different birth control methods at the same time starting one month before, during, and for one month after stopping therapy every time I have sexual intercourse, even if one of the methods I choose is hormonal birth control. Initial  I understand that the following are effective forms of birth control Primary forms tubal sterilization (tying my tubes) partners vasectomy intrauterine device hormonal (combination birth control pills, skin patches, shots, undertheskin implants or vaginal ring) Secondary forms Barrier male condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) A diaphragm and cervical cap must each be used with spermicide, a special cream that kills sperm I understand that at least one of my two forms of birth control must be a primary method. Initial  I will talk with my doctor about any medicines including herbal products I plan to take during my isotretinoin treatment because hormonal birth control methods may not work if I am taking certain medicines or herbal products.Initial  I may receive a free birth control counseling session from a doctor or other family planning expert. My isotretinoin doctor can give me an isotretinoin Patient Referral Form for this free consultation.Initial  I must begin using the birth control methods I have chosen as described above at least one month before I start taking isotretinoin. Initial  I cannot get my first prescription for isotretinoin unless my doctor has told me that I have two negative pregnancy test results. The first pregnancy test should be done when my doctor decides to prescribe isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test must be done in a lab during the first 5 days of my menstrual period right before starting isotretinoin therapy treatment or as instructed by my doctor. I will then have one pregnancy test in a lab. every month during treatment at the end of treatment and 1 month after stopping treatment I must not start taking isotretinoin until I am sure that I am not pregnant, have negative results from two pregnancy tests, and the second test has been done in a lab. Initial  I have read and understand the materials my doctor has given to me, including The iPLEDGE Program Guide for Isotretinoin for Female Patients Who Can Get Pregnant, The iPLEDGE Birth Control Workbook and The iPLEDGE Program Patient Introductory Brochure My doctor gave me and asked me to watch the DVD containing a video about birth control and a video about birth defects and isotretinoin. I was told about a private counseling line that I may call for more information about birth control. I have received information on emergency birth control. Initial  I must stop taking isotretinoin right away and call my doctor if I get pregnant, miss my expected menstrual period, stop using birth control or have sexual intercourse without using my two birth control methods at any time. Initial  My doctor gave me information about the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE program should I become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within one month of the last dose. I understand that if I become pregnant, information about my pregnancy, my health, and my babys health may be shared with the makers of isotretinoin, authorized parties who maintain the iPLEDGE program for the makers of isotretinoin and government health regulatory authorities.Initial  I understand that being qualified to receive isotretinoin in the iPLEDGE program means that I have had two negative urine or blood pregnancy tests before receiving the first isotretinoin prescription. The second test must be done in a lab. I must have a negative result from a urine or blood pregnancy test done in a lab repeated each month before I receive another isotretinoin prescription. have chosen and agreed to use two forms of effective birth control at the same time. At least one method must be a primary form of birth control, unless I have chosen never to have sexual contact with a male (abstinence), or I have undergone a hysterectomy. I must use two forms of birth control for at least one month before I start isotretinoin therapy, during therapy and for one month after stopping therapy. I must receive counseling, repeated on a monthly basis, about birth control and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy. have signed a Patient InformationInformed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) that contains warnings about the chance of possible birth defects if I am pregnant or become pregnant and my unborn baby is exposed to isotretinoin. have interacted with the iPLEDGE program before starting isotretinoin and on a monthly basis to answer questions on the program requirements and to enter my two chosen forms of birth control.

I, ,(Patients Name) understand that isotretinoin is a medicine used to treat severe nodular acne that cannot be cleared up by any other acne treatments, including antibiotics. In severe nodular acne, many red, swollen, tender lumps form in the skin. If untreated, severe nodular acne can lead to permanent scars. Initials  My doctor has told me about my choices for treating my acne.Initials  I understand that there are serious side effects that may happen while I am taking isotretinoin. These have been explained to me. These side effects include serious birth defects in babies of pregnant patients. Note There is a second Patient InformationInformed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant). Initials  I understand that some patients, while taking isotretinoin or soon after stopping isotretinoin, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, anxious or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin (see 7 below). Initials  Before I start taking isotretinoin, I agree to tell my doctor if I have ever had symptoms of depression (see 7 below), been psychotic, attempted suicide, had any other mental problems or take medicine for any of these problems. Being psychotic means having a loss of contact with reality, such as hearing voices or seeing things that are not there. Initials  Before I start taking isotretinoin, I agree to tell my doctor if, to the best of my knowledge, anyone in my family has ever had symptoms of depression, been psychotic, attempted suicide or had any other serious mental problems.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Amnesteem should be administered with a meal (see PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients). The recommended dosage range for Amnesteem is 0.5 to 1 mgkgday given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mgkgday,8 it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease andor the appearance of clinical side effects  some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mgkgday, as tolerated. Failure to take Amnesteem with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions. The safety of once daily dosing with Amnesteem has not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended. If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70 prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Longterm use of Amnesteem, even in low doses, has not been studied, and is not recommended. It is important that Amnesteem be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. The effect of longterm use of Amnesteem on bone loss is unknown (see WARNINGS Skeletal Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, and Premature Epiphyseal Closure). Contraceptive measures must be followed for any subsequent course of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS). Table 4.

<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>Pediatric Use The use of Amnesteem in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age has not been studied. The use of Amnesteem for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years should be given careful consideration, especially for those patients where a known metabolic or structural bone disease exists (see PRECAUTIONS General). Use of Amnesteem in this age group for severe recalcitrant nodular acne is supported by evidence from a clinical study comparing 103 pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) to 197 adult patients ( 18 years). Results from this study demonstrated that Amnesteem, at a dose of 1 mgkgday given in two divided doses, was equally effective in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne in both pediatric and adult patients. In studies with Amnesteem, adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In an openlabel clinical trial (N  217) of a single course of therapy with Amnesteem for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change  4 and total hip change  5) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density  4 based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density  4, and all the other patients (92) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density  5 based on unadjusted data. Twenty one (10.6) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density  5, and all the other patients (89) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Followup studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range 1.6 to 7.6) in five of eight patients (62.5). In a separate openlabel extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of Amnesteem 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25 (see WARNINGS Skeletal Bone Mineral Density).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when Amnesteem is dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE program patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient InformationInformed Consent (for all patients) form. Female patients of childbearing potential must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when Amnesteem therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting Amnesteem, while taking Amnesteem, and for one month after Amnesteem has been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from heterosexual intercourse. They should also sign a second Patient InformationInformed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form prior to beginning Amnesteem therapy. They should be given an opportunity to view the patient DVD provided by the manufacturer to the prescriber. The DVD includes information about contraception, the most common reasons that contraception fails, and the importance of using two forms of effective contraception when taking teratogenic drugs and comprehensive information about types of potential birth defects which could occur if a female patient who is pregnant takes Amnesteem at any time during pregnancy. Female patients should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIAcertified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another Amnesteem prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Amnesteem is found in the semen of male patients taking Amnesteem, but the amount delivered to a female partner would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the noeffect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses however two of these reports were incomplete and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of Amnesteem treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop Amnesteem and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of Amnesteem treatment may be insufficient further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient andor the patients family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether Amnesteem therapy is appropriate in this setting for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of Amnesteem therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking Amnesteem or soon after stopping Amnesteem, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, anxious or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking Amnesteem have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on Amnesteem becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if Amnesteem caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take Amnesteem. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking Amnesteem. Patients must be informed that they must not share Amnesteem with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to Amnesteem. Patients should be reminded to take Amnesteem with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during Amnesteem therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Skin and Appendages). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16 of patients treated with Amnesteem in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of Amnesteem, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Musculoskeletal). There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests CPK). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29 (104358) of pediatric patients treated with Amnesteem developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5 (14104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22 (79358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6 (679) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of Amnesteem. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of Amnesteem if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Amnesteem should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (StevenJohnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in postmarketing data. Amnesteem should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>General Although an effect of Amnesteem on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing Amnesteem to patients with a genetic predisposition for age related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes druginduced osteoporosisosteomalacia andor affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant. Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. There are spontaneous reports of fractures andor delayed healing in patients while on therapy with Amnesteem or following cessation of therapy with Amnesteem while involved in these activities. While causality to Amnesteem has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Psychiatric Disorders Amnesteem may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive andor violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Psychiatric). Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of Amnesteem therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure (Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults), include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop Amnesteem and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of Amnesteem therapy may be insufficient further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient andor the patients family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether Amnesteem therapy is appropriate in this setting for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of Amnesteem therapy. Pseudotumor Cerebri Amnesteem use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue Amnesteem immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Neurological). Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions e.g., StevensJohnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) associated with isotretinoin use. These events may be serious and result in death, lifethreatening events, hospitalization or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions and discontinuation of Amnesteem should be considered if warranted. Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. Amnesteem should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur. Lipids Elevations of serum triglycerides in excess of 800 mgdL have been reported in patients treated with Amnesteem. Marked elevations of serum triglycerides were reported in approximately 25 of patients receiving Amnesteem in clinical trials. In addition, approximately 15 developed a decrease in highdensity lipoproteins and about 7 showed an increase in cholesterol levels. In clinical trials, the effects on triglycerides, HDL and cholesterol were reversible upon cessation of Amnesteem therapy. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight, restriction of dietary fat and alcohol, and reduction in dose while continuing Amnesteem.5 Blood lipid determinations should be performed before Amnesteem is given and then at intervals until the lipid response to Amnesteem is established, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Especially careful consideration must be given to riskbenefit for patients who may be at high risk during Amnesteem therapy (patients with <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b>, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If Amnesteem therapy is instituted, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids andor blood sugar are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS Laboratory Tests). The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with Amnesteem are unknown. Animal Studies In rats given 8 or 32 mgkgday of isotretinoin (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mgkgday (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking Amnesteem in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this event have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue Amnesteem treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Special Senses). Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis considered to be possibly or probably related to Amnesteem therapy has been reported. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15 of individuals treated during clinical trials, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment with Amnesteem, the drug should be discontinued and the etiology further investigated. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Amnesteem has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after Amnesteem treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue Amnesteem immediately (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Gastrointestinal). Skeletal Bone Mineral Density Effects of multiple courses of Amnesteem on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that longterm, high dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. In an openlabel clinical trial (N  217) of a single course of therapy with Amnesteem for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change  4 and total hip change  5) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density  4 based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density  4, and all the other patients (92) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density  5 based on unadjusted data. Twenty one (10.6) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density  5, and all the other patients (89) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Followup studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range 1.6 to 7.6) in five of eight patients (62.5). In a separate openlabel extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of Amnesteem 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25 (see PRECAUTIONS Pediatric Use). Spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone fractures and delayed healing of bone fractures have been seen in the Amnesteem population. While causality to Amnesteem has not been established, an effect cannot be ruled out. Longer term effects have not been studied. It is important that Amnesteem be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mgkgday. Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in six of eight patients in a prospective study of disorders of keratinization.6 Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by xray in prospective studies of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple Amnesteem treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical study of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mgkgday of Amnesteem given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of Amnesteem. The effect of multiple courses of Amnesteem on epiphyseal closure is unknown. Vision Impairment Visual problems should be carefully monitored. All Amnesteem patients experiencing visual difficulties should discontinue Amnesteem treatment and have an ophthalmological examination (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Special Senses). Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving Amnesteem for acne and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with Amnesteem have either completely resolved or were resolving at followup 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug (see ADVERSE REACTIONS Special Senses). Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during Amnesteem therapy and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mgkgday (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown. Nodular Acne Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with Amnesteem, and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation.1 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of Amnesteem under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high fat meal when compared with Amnesteem given under fasted conditions (see Table 2 ). The observed elimination halflife was unchanged. This lack of change in halflife suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (Tmax) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, Amnesteem capsules should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects with normal skin. Table 2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Mean (CV), N  74 Amnesteem 2 x 40 mg Capsules AUC0 (nghrmL) Cmax (ngmL) Tmax (hr) t12 (hr) Fed 10,004 (22) 862 (22) 5.3 (77) 21 (39) Fasted 3,703 (46) 301 (63) 3.2 (56) 21 (30) Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9 bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Metabolism Following oral administration of isotretinoin, at least three metabolites have been identified in human plasma 4oxoisotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4oxoretinoic acid (4oxotretinoin). Retinoic acid and 13cisretinoic acid are geometric isomers and show reversible interconversion. The administration of one isomer will give rise to the other. Isotretinoin is also irreversibly oxidized to 4oxoisotretinoin, which forms its geometric isomer 4oxotretinoin. After a single 80 mg oral dose of Amnesteem to 74 healthy adult subjects, concurrent administration of food increased the extent of formation of all metabolites in plasma when compared to the extent of formation under fasted conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity that is in some in vitro models more than that of the parent isotretinoin. However, the clinical significance of these models is unknown. After multiple oral dose administration of isotretinoin to adult cystic acne patients ( 18 years), the exposure of patients to 4oxoisotretinoin at steadystate under fasted and fed conditions was approximately 3.4 times higher than that of isotretinoin. In vitro studies indicate that the primary P450 isoforms involved in isotretinoin metabolism are 2C8, 2C9, 3A4 and 2B6. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates, which are then excreted in urine and feces. Elimination Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of 14Cisotretinoin as a liquid suspension, 14Cactivity in blood declined with a halflife of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and any conjugates are ultimately excreted in the feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65 to 83). After a single 80 mg oral dose of Amnesteem to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean  SD elimination halflives (t12) of isotretinoin and 4oxoisotretinoin were 21  8.2 hours and 24  5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.9 to 5.43 in patients with cystic acne. Special Patient Populations Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were evaluated after single and multiple doses in 38 pediatric patients (12 to 15 years) and 19 adult patients ( 18 years) who received Amnesteem for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. In both age groups, 4oxoisotretinoin was the major metabolite tretinoin and 4oxotretinoin were also observed. The dosenormalized pharmacokinetic parameters for isotretinoin following single and multiple doses are summarized in Table 3 for pediatric patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between pediatric and adult patients. Table 3.

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS Amnesteem must not be used by female patients who are or may become pregnant. There is an extremely high risk that severe birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking Amnesteem in any amount, even for short periods of time. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Birth defects which have been documented following Amnesteem exposure include abnormalities of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported. There is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported. Documented external abnormalities include skull abnormality ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals) eye abnormalities (including microphthalmia) facial dysmorphia cleft palate. Documented internal abnormalities include CNS abnormalities (including cerebral abnormalities, cerebellar malformation, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit) cardiovascular abnormalities thymus gland abnormality parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases death has occurred with certain of the abnormalities previously noted. If pregnancy does occur during treatment of a female patient who is taking Amnesteem, Amnesteem must be discontinued immediately and she should be referred to an ObstetricianGynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Special Prescribing Requirements Because of Amnesteems teratogenicity and to minimize fetal exposure, Amnesteem is approved for marketing only under a special restricted distribution program approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This program is called iPLEDGE. Amnesteem must only be prescribed by prescribers who are registered and activated with the iPLEDGE program. Amnesteem must only be dispensed by a pharmacy registered and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are registered and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE (see PRECAUTIONS). Do not get pregnant causes birth defects, INFORMATION FOR PHARMACISTS Access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (18664950654) to obtain an authorization and the do not dispense to patient after date. Amnesteem must only be dispensed in no more than a 30 day supply. REFILLS REQUIRE A NEW PRESCRIPTION AND A NEW AUTHORIZATION FROM THE iPLEDGE SYSTEM. An Amnesteem Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time Amnesteem is dispensed, as required by law. This Amnesteem Medication Guide is an important part of the risk management program for the patient.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE The oral LD50 of isotretinoin is greater than 4000 mgkg in rats and mice ( 600 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday after normalization of the rat dose for total body surface area and  300 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday after normalization of the mouse dose for total body surface area) and is approximately 1960 mgkg in rabbits (653 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mgkgday after normalization for total body surface area). In humans, overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolve without apparent residual effects. Amnesteem causes serious birth defects at any dosage (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS). Female patients of childbearing potential who present with isotretinoin overdose must be evaluated for pregnancy. Patients who are pregnant should receive counseling about the risks to the fetus, as described in the Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS. Nonpregnant patients must be warned to avoid pregnancy for at least one month and receive contraceptive counseling as described in PRECAUTIONS . Educational materials for such patients can be obtained by calling the manufacturer. Because an overdose would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a female patient who is or might become pregnant, for one month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least one month.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Druginduced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt andor a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection diverticulitis fresh intestinal anastomoses active or latent peptic ulcer renal insufficiency hypertension osteoporosis and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Kaposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical remission. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a riskbenefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Drug Interactions The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important. Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone therefore, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increases in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired response. Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance. Therefore, the dose of methylprednisolone should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when methylprednisolone is withdrawn. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect. Information for the Patient Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. Infections with any pathogen including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic infections, in any location of the body, may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents that affect cellular immunity, humoral immunity, or neutrophil function.1 These infections may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases.2 There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of childbearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered to patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. Indicated immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. The use of MEDROL Tablets in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in nonimmune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease andor prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed, to chicken pox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroidinduced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>"General Precautions Druginduced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt andor a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection diverticulitis fresh intestinal anastomoses active or latent peptic ulcer renal insufficiency hypertension osteoporosis and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Kaposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical remission. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a riskbenefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of MEDROL Tablets may vary from 4 mg to 48 mg of methylprednisolone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, MEDROL should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patients individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of MEDROL for a period of time consistent with the patients condition. If after longterm therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (4 mg of methylprednisolone is equivalent to 5 mg of prednisolone). ADT (Alternate Day Therapy) Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring longterm pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitaryadrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises (a) the antiinflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for reestablishment of more nearly normal hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) activity on the offsteroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenal cortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenal cortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushings disease, a syndrome of adrenal cortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b>, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during longterm pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every six hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenal cortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenal cortical suppression for 1 to 1 days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy 1)Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2)ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom longterm pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3)In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4)Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (eg, patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5)As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (eg, dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6)The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7)In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flareup in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the offsteroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8)In the event of an acute flareup of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be reinstituted. 9)Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefitrisk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Initial Therapy In patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension not on diuretic therapy, the recommended initial dose is 10 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 20 to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose. The antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval regardless of the administered dose, but most commonly with a dose of 10 mg daily. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure just prior to dosing to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained for 24 hours. If it is not, an increase in dose should be considered. Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give greater effect. If blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets USP alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added. Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg has been shown to provide an additive effect. After the addition of a diuretic, it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril tablets USP. Diuretic Treated Patients In hypertensive patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension may occur occasionally following the initial dose of lisinopril tablets USP. The diuretic should be discontinued, if possible, for two to three days before beginning therapy with lisinopril tablets USP to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (seeWARNINGS). The dosage of lisinopril tablets USP should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. If the patientblood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets USP alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed as described above. If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (seeWARNINGSandPRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Concomitant administration of lisinopril tablets USP with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassiumsparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment The usual dose of lisinopril tablets USP (10 mg) is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance  30 mLmin (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mgdL). For patients with creatinine clearance10 mLmin30 mLmin (serum creatinine3 mgdL), the first dose is 5 mg once daily. For patients with creatinine clearance  10 mLmin (usually on hemodialysis) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum of 40 mg daily.  SeeWARNINGS, Anaphylactoid ReactionsDuring Membrane Exposure. Dosage or dosing interval should be adjusted depending on the blood pressure response.Renal StatusCreatinine Clearance mLminInitial Dose mgdayNormal renal function to mild impairment 3010Moderate to severe impairment10305Dialysis patients 102.5  Heart Failure Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy with diuretics and (usually) digitalis. The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day. When initiating treatment with lisinopril, USP in patients with heart failure, the initial dose should be administered under medical observation, especially in those patients with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg). The mean peak blood pressure lowering occurs six to eight hours after dosing. Observation should continue until blood pressure is stable. The concomitant diuretic dose should be reduced, if possible, to help minimize hypovolemia which may contribute to hypotension (seeWARNINGSandPRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of lisinopril tablets USP does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension. The usual effective dosage range is 5 to 40 mg per day administered as a single daily dose. The dose of lisinopril tablets USP can be increased by increments of no greater than 10 mg, at intervals of no less than 2 weeks to the highest tolerated dose, up to a maximum of 40 mg daily. Dose adjustment should be based on the clinical response of individual patients. Dosage Adjustment in Patients With Heart Failure and Renal Impairment or Hyponatremia In patients with heart failure who have hyponatremia (serum sodium  130 mEqL) or moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance30 mLmin or serum creatinine  3 mgdL), therapy with lisinopril tablets USP should be initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg once a day under close medical supervision (seeWARNINGSandPRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Acute Myocardial Infarction In hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, the first dose of lisinopril tablets USP is 5 mg given orally, followed by 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours and then 10 mg of lisinopril tablets USP once daily. Dosing should continue for six weeks. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin, and betablockers. Patients with a low systolic blood pressure (120 mmHg) when treatment is started or during the first 3 days after the infarct should be given a lower 2.5 mg oral dose of lisinopril tablets USP (seeWARNINGS). If hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure100 mmHg), a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg may be given with temporary reductions to 2.5 mg if needed. If prolonged hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure  90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) lisinopril tablets USP should be withdrawn. For patients who develop symptoms of heart failure, seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure. Dosage Adjustment in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Renal Impairment In acute myocardial infarction, treatment with lisinopril tablets USP should be initiated with caution in patients with evidence of renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine concentration exceeding 2 mgdL. No evaluation of dosing adjustments in myocardial infarction patients with severe renal impairment has been performed. Use in Elderly In general, the clinical response was similar in younger and older patients given similar doses of lisinopril tablets USP. Pharmacokinetic studies, however, indicate that maximum blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) are doubled in older patients, so that dosage adjustments should be made with particular caution. Pediatric Hypertensive Patients6 Years of Age The usual recommended starting dose is 0.07 mgkg once daily (up to 5 mg total). Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. Doses above 0.61 mgkg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in pediatric patients (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,PharmacokineticsandMetabolism and Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects). Lisinopril tablets USP are not recommended in pediatric patients  6 years or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate  30 mLmin1.73 m2 (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism and Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects andPRECAUTIONS). Preparation of Suspension (for 200 mL of a 1 mgmL Suspension) Add 10 mL of Purified Water USP to a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle containing ten 20 mg tablets of lisinopril tablets USP and shake for at least one minute. Add 30 mL of Bicitradiluent and 160 mL of OraSweet SFto the concentrate in the PET bottle and gently shake for several seconds to disperse the ingredients. The suspension should be stored at or below 25(77and can be stored for up to four weeks. Shake the suspension before each use.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lisinopril inhibits angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidly dispeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotension I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotension II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of lisinopril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system.Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassum. In hypertensive patiens with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEqL however, approximately 15 of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEqL and approximately 6 had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEqL and approximately 12 had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEqL (see PRECAUTIONS). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system,lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with lowrenin hypertension. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a lowrenin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than nonBlack patients. Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and nonBlack patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response were no longer evident. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Adult Patients Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about 7 hours, although there was a trend to a small delay in time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in acute myocardial infarction patients. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25, with large intersubject variability (6 to 60) at all doses tested (5 to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute bioavailability of lisinopril is reduced to 16 in patients with stable NYHA Class IIIV congestive heart failure, and the volume of distribution appears to be slightly smaller than that in normal subjects. The oral bioavailability of lisinopril in patients with acute myocardial infarction is similar to that in healthy volunteers. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective halflife of accumulation of 12 hours. Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mLmin. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination halflife is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the bloodbrain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14C lisinopril. By whole body autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between 6 years and 16 years with glomerular filtration rate  30 mLmin1.73 m2. After doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mgkg, steady state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within 6 hours and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28. These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults. The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearanceabsolute bioavailability) in a child weighing 30 kg is 10 Lh, which increases in proportion to renal function. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Hypertension Adult Patients Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume andor saltdepleted patients (seeWARNINGS). When given together with thiazidetype diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of the two drugs are approximately additive. In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by 6 hours. Although an antihypertensive effect was observed 24 hours after dosing with recommended single daily doses, the effect was more consistent and the mean effect was considerably larger in some studies with doses of 20 mg or more than with lower doses. However, at all doses studied, the mean antihypertensive effect was substantially smaller 24 hours after dosing than it was 6 hours after dosing. In some patients, achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy. The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril are maintained during longterm therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure, or a significant increase in blood pressure compared to pretreatment levels. Lisinopril had similar effectiveness and adverse effects in younger and older ( 65 years) patients. It was less effective in Blacks than in Caucasians. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large. In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (seePRECAUTIONS). Pediatric Patients In a clinical study involving 115 hypertensive pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who weighed  50 kg received either 0.625, 2.5, or 20 mg of lisinopril daily and patients who weighed50 kg received either 1.25, 5, or 40 mg of lisinopril daily. At the end of 2 weeks, lisinopril administered once daily lowered trough blood pressure in a dosedependent manner with consistent antihypertensive efficacy demonstrated at doses  1.25 mg (0.02 mgkg). This effect was confirmed in a withdrawal phase, where the diastolic pressure rose by about 9 mmHg more in patients randomized to placebo than it did in patients who were randomized to remain on the middle and high doses of lisinopril. The dosedependent antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was consistent across several demographic subgroups age, Tanner stage, gender, and race. In this study, lisinopril was generally welltolerated. In the above pediatric studies, lisinopril was given either as tablets or in a suspension for those children and infants who were unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Preparation of Suspension (for 200 mL of a 1 mgmL Suspension)). Heart Failure During baselinecontrolled clinical trials, in patients receiving digitalis and diuretics, single doses of lisinopril resulted in decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and no change in heart rate. In two placebo controlled, 12 week clinical studies using doses of lisinopril up to 20 mg, lisinopril as adjunctive therapy to digitalis and diuretics improved the following signs and symptoms due to congestive heart failure edema, rales, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and jugular venous distention. In one of the studies, beneficial response was also noted for orthopnea, presence of third heart sound and the number of patients classified as NYHA Class III and IV. Exercise tolerance was also improved in this study. The oncedaily dosing for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic response. A large (over 3000 patients) survival study, the ATLAS Trial, comparing 2.5 and 35 mg of lisinopril in patients with heart failure, showed that the higher dose of lisinopril had outcomes at least as favorable as the lower dose. Acute Myocardial Infarction The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienza nellMiocardico (GISSI3) study was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted in 19,394 patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to a coronary care unit. It was designed to examine the effects of shortterm (6 week) treatment with lisinopril, nitrates, their combination, or no therapy on shortterm (6 week) mortality and on longterm death and markedly impaired cardiac function. Patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms who were hemodynamically stable were randomized, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, to six weeks of either 1) lisinopril alone (n  4841), 2) nitrates alone (n  4869), 3) lisinopril plus nitrates (n  4841), or 4) open control (n  4843). All patients received routine therapies, including thrombolytics (72), aspirin (84), and a betablocker (31), as appropriate, normally utilized in acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients. The protocol excluded patients with hypotension (systolic blood pressure100 mmHg), severe heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine  2 mgdL andor proteinuria  500 mg24 h). Doses of lisinopril were adjusted as necessary according to protocol (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Study treatment was withdrawn at six weeks except where clinical conditions indicated continuation of treatment. The primary outcomes of the trial were the overall mortality at 6 weeks and a combined endpoint at 6 months after the myocardial infarction, consisting of the number of patients who died, had late (day 4) clinical congestive heart failure, or had extensive left ventricular damage defined as ejection fraction35 or an akineticdyskinetic AD score45. Patients receiving lisinopril (n  9646), alone or with nitrates, had an 11 lower risk of death (2p twotailed  0.04) compared to patients receiving no lisinopril (n  9672) (6.4 vs. 7.2, respectively) at six weeks. Although patients randomized to receive lisinopril for up to six weeks also fared numerically better on the combined endpoint at 6 months, the open nature of the assessment of heart failure, substantial loss to followup echocardiography, and substantial excess use of lisinopril between 6 weeks and 6 months in the group randomized to 6 weeks of lisinopril, preclude any conclusion about this endpoint. Patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with lisinopril, had a higher (9 vs. 3.7) incidence of persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure  90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) and renal dysfunction (2.4 vs. 1.1) inhospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mgdL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration) (seeADVERSE REACTIONS, Acute Myocardial Infarction).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including lisinopril) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis andor larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. This may occur at any time during treatment. ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in nonBlack patients. Lisinopril should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. Even in those instances where swelling of only the tongue is involved, without respiratory distress, patients may require prolonged observation since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient. Very rarely, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery.Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 11000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) andor measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided (seeADVERSE REACTIONS). Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angiodema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vimiting) in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angiedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see alsoINDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained lifethreatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Sudden and potentially lifethreatening anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in some patients dialyzed with highflux membranes (e.g., AN69) and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions must be initiated. Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing lowdensity lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Excessive hypotension is rare in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with lisinopril alone. Patients with heart failure given lisinopril commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, with peak blood pressure reduction occurring 6 to 8 hours post dose. Evidence from the twodose ATLAS trial suggested that incidence of hypotension may increase with the dose of lisinopril in heart failure patients. Discontinuation of thereapy because of the continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed caution should be observed when inititating thereapy DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients at risk of excessive hypotension, sometimes associated with oliguria andor progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure andor death, include those with the following conditions or characteristics heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, or severe volume andor salt depletion of any etiology. It may be advisable to eliminate the diuretic (except in patients with heart failure), reduce the diuretic dose or increase salt intake cautiously before initiating therapy with lisinopril in patients at risk for excessive hypotension who are able to tolerate such adjustments (seePRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, andADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients with acute myocardial infarction in the GISSI3 trial had a higher (9 vs. 3.7) incidence of persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure  90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) when treated with lisinopril. Treatment with lisinopril must not be initiated in acute myocardial infarction patients at risk of further serious hemodynamic deterioration after treatment with a vasodilator (e.g., systolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or lower) or cardiogenic shock. In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril andor diuretic is increased. Similar considerations may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease, or in patients with acute myocardial infarction, in whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses of lisinopril which usually can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. If symptomatic hypotension develops, a dose reduction or discontinuation of lisinopril or concomitant diuretic may be necessary. LeukopeniaNeutropeniaAgranulocytosis Another angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients but more frequently in patients with renal impairment especially if they also have a collagen vascular disease. Available data from clinical trials of lisinopril are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Marketing experience has revealed rare cases of leukopenianeutropenia and bone marrow depression in which a causal relationship to lisinopril cannot be excluded. Periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and renal disease should be considered. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice or hepatitis and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical followup. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the reninangiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue lisinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the reninangiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the reninangiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intraamniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue lisinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to lisinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (seePRECAUTIONS,Pediatric Use). No teratogenic effects of lisinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits. On a mgkg basis, the doses used were up to 625 times (in mice), 188 times (in rats), and 0.6 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.</td></tr>

Rash, photosensitivity or other dermatological manifestations may occur alone or in combination with these symptoms. Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving lisinopril with an incidence higher in Black than in nonBlack patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis andor larynx occurs, treatment with lisinopril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately (see WARNINGS). In rare cases, intestinal angioedema has been reported in postmarketing experience. Hypotension In hypertensive patients, hypotension occurred in 1.2 and syncope occurred in 0.1 of patients with an incidence higher in Black than in nonBlack patients. Hypotension or syncope was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in 0.5 of hypertensive patients. In patients with heart failure, hypotension occurred in 5.3 and syncope occurred in 1.8 of patients. These adverse experiences were possibly doserelated (see above data from ATLAS Trial) and caused discontinuation of therapy in 1.8 of these patients in the symptomatic trials. In patients treated with lisinopril for six weeks after acute myocardial infarction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure100 mmHg) resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 9.7 of the patients (seeWARNINGS). Cough SeePRECAUTIONS,Cough. Pediatric Patients No relevant differences between the adverse experience profile for pediatric patients and that previously reported for adult patients were identified. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia (seePRECAUTIONS), hyponatremia Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in about 2 of patients with essential hypertension treated with lisinopril alone. Increases were more common in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and in patients with renal artery stenosis (seePRECAUTIONS). Reversible minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in approximately 11.6 of patients with heart failure on concomitant diuretic therapy. Frequently, these abnormalities resolved when the dosage of the diuretic was decreased. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.4 G and 1.3 vol, respectively) occured frequently in patients treated with lisinopril but were rarely of clinical importance in patients without some other cause of anemia. In clinical trials, less than 0.1 of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Hemolytic anemia has been reported a casual relationship to lisinopril cannot be excluded. Liver Function Tests Rarely, elevations of liver enzymes andor serum bilirubin have occurred (seeWARNINGS, Hepatic Failure). In hypertensive patients, 2 discontinued therapy due to laboratory adverse experiences, principally elevations in blood urea nitrogen (0.6), serum creatinine (0.5) and serum potassium (0.4). In the heart faulure trials, 3.4 of patiens discontinued therapy due to laboratory adverse experience 1.8 due to elevations in blood ura nitrogen andor creatinine and 0.6 due to elevations in serum potassium. In the myocardial infarction trial, 2 of patients receiving lisinopril discontinued thereapy due to renal dysfunction (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mgdL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration) less than 1 of patients discontinued therapy due to other laboratory adverse experiences 0.1 with hyperkalemia and less than 0.1 with hepatic enzyme alterations.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Aortic StenosisHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy As with all vasodilators, lisinopril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the reninangiotensinaldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system, treatment with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be associated with oliguria andor progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure andor death. In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril andor diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some patients with hypertension or heart failure with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when lisinopril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction andor discontinuation of the diuretic andor lisinopril may be required. Patients with acute myocardial infarction in the GISSI3 trial treated with lisinopril had a higher (2.4 vs. 1.1) incidence of renal dysfunction inhospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mgdL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration). In acute myocardial infarction, treatment with lisinopril should be initiated with caution in patients with evidence of renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine concentration exceeding 2 mgdL. If renal dysfunction develops during treatment with lisinopril (serum creatinine concentration exceeding 3 mgdL or a doubling from the pretreatment value) then the physician should consider withdrawal of lisinopril. Evaluation of patients with hypertension, heart failure, or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5.7 mEqL) occurred in approximately 2.2 of hypertensive patients and 4.8 of patients with heart failure. In most cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Hyperkalemia was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in approximately 0.1 of hypertensive patients, 0.6 of patients with heart failure and 0.1 of patients with myocardial infarction. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassiumsparing diuretics, potassium supplements andor potassiumcontaining salt substitutes. Hyperkalemia can cause serious, sometimes fatal, arrhythmias. Lisinopril should be used cautiously, if at all, with these agents and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, almost always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitorinduced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. SurgeryAnesthesia In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, lisinopril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion. Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur at any time during treatment with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician. Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned to report lightheadedness especially during the first few days of therapy. If actual syncope occurs, the patient should be told to discontinue the drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician. All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. Other causes of volume depletion such as vimiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure patients should be advised to consult with their physician. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician. Hypoglycemia Diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin starting an ACE inhibitor should be told to closely monitor for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of combined use (seePRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). LeukopeniaNeutropenia Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever) which may be a sign of leukopenianeutropenia. Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to lisinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. NOTEAs with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated with lisinopril is warranted. This information is intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. Drug Interactions HypotensionPatients on Diuretic Therapy Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with lisinopril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with lisinopril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, initiate therapy with lisinopril at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized (seeWARNINGSandDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed. Studies with ACE inhibitors in combination with diuretics indicate that the dose of the ACE inhibitor can be reduced when it is given with a diuretic (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Antidiabetics Epidemiological studies have suggested that concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medicines (insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased bloodglucoselowering effect with risk of hypoglycemia. This phenomenon appeared to be more likely to occur during the first weeks of combined treatment and in patients with renal impairment. In diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, glycemic control should be closely monitored for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of treatment with an ACE inhibitor. NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase2 Inhibitors (COX2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volumedepleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Other Agents Lisinopril has been used concomitantly with nitrates andor digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. This included post myocardial infarction patients who were receiving intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin. No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazidetype diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassiumsparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassiumcontaining salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Potassiumsparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure who are receiving lisinopril. Lithium Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including lisinopril. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when lisinopril was administered for 105 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 90 mgkgday (about 56 or 9 times the maximum recommended daily human dose, based on body weight and body surface area, respectively). There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when lisinopril was administered for 92 weeks to (male and female) mice at doses up to 135 mgkgday (about 84 times the maximum recommended daily human dose). This dose was 6.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area in mice. Lisinopril was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation. It was also negative in a forward mutation assay using Chinese hamster lung cells. Lisinopril did not produce single strand DNA breaks in an in vitro alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay. In addition, lisinopril did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro test in Chinese hamster ovary cells or in an in vivo study in mouse bone marrow. There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance in male and female rats treated with up to 300 mgkgday of lisinopril. This dose is 188 times and 30 times the maximum human dose when based on mgkg and mgm2, respectively. Calculations assume a human weight of 50 kg and human body surface area of 1.62 m2. Nursing Mothers Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14C lisinopril. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ACE inhibitors, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue lisinopril, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to lisinopril If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension andor substituting for disordered renal function. Lisinopril, which crosses the placenta, has been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit, and theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion, although there is no experience with the latter procedure. Antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have been established in hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years. There are no data on the effect of lisinopril on blood pressure in pediatric patients under the age of 6 or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate  30 mLmin1.73 m2 (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokineticsand MetabolismandPharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects,andDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of lisinopril in patients with hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other clinical experience in this population has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In the ATLAS trial of lisinopril in patients with congestive heart failure, 1,596 (50) were 65 and over, while 437 (14) were 75 and over. In a clinical study of lisinopril in patients with myocardial infarctions, 4,413 (47) were 65 and over, while 1,656 (18) were 75 and over. In these studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients, and other reported clinical experiences have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Heart Failure and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Acute Myocardial Infarction). Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that maximum blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) are doubled in older patients (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. Evaluation of patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS  USAGE Hypertension Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education ProgramJoint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Lisinopril tablets USP may be administered alone or with other antihypertensive agents. Heart Failure Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the management of heart failure in patients who are not responding adequately to diuretics and digitalis. Acute Myocardial Infarction Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction, to improve survival. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin and betablockers. In using lisinopril tablets USP, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril tablets USP do not have a similar risk (seeWARNINGS). In considering the use of lisinopril tablets USP, it should be noted that in controlled clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in Black patients than in nonBlacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in nonBlack patients (seeWARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS GENERAL Epinephrine 11000 should be available as well as personnel trained in administering emergency treatment. Allergenic Extracts are not intended for intravenous injections. For safe and effective use of allergenic extracts, sterile diluents, sterile vials, sterile syringes should be used and aseptic precautions observed when making a dilution andor administering the allergenic extract injection. A sterile tuberculin syringe graduated in 0.1 ml units to measure each dose for the prescribed dilution should be used. To reduce the risk of an occurrence of adverse reactions, begin with a careful personal history plus a physical exam. Confirm your findings with scratch or intradermal skin testing. Standardized extracts are those labeled in AUml units or BAUml units. Standardized extracts are not interchangeable with extracts previously labeled as wtvol or PNUml. Before administering a standardized extract, read the accompanying insert contained with standardized extracts. Information for Patients All concentrates of allergenic extracts have the ability to cause serious local and systemic reactions including death in sensitive patients. Patients should be informed of this risk prior to skin testing and immunotherapy. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms that may occur and to report all adverse reactions to a physician. Patients should be instructed to remain in the office for 30 minutes during testing using allergenic extracts and at least 30 minutes after therapeutic injections using allergenic extracts. DRUG INTERACTIONS Some drugs may affect the reactivity of the skin patients should be instructed to avoid medications, particularly antihistamines and sympathomimetic drugs, for at least 24 hours prior to skin testing. Antihistamines and Hydroxyzine can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions as they tend to neutralize or antagonize the action of histamine.(3) This effect has been primarily documented when testing was performed within 1 to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Partial inhibition of the skin test reaction had been observed for longer periods. Epinephrine injection inhibits the immediate skin test reactions for several hours. Patients on delayed absorption antihistamine tablets should be free of such medication for 48 hours before testing. Patients using Astemizole (Hismanal) may experience prolonged suppression and should be free from such medication for up to 6 to 8 weeks prior to testing. Refer to package insert from an applicable long acting antihistamine manufacturer for additional information. Extreme caution should be taken when using allergenic extracts on patients who are taking betablockers. Patients on nonselective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing or treatment and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility Long term studies in animals have not been conducted with allergenic extracts to determine their potential carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or impairment of fertility. Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Allergenic Extracts. It is not known whether allergenic extracts can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or can affect reproduction capacity. Allergenic extracts should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug appears in human milk. Because many drugs are detected in human milk, caution should be exercised when Allergenic Extracts are administered to a nursing woman. There are no current studies on extract components in human milk, or their effect on the nursing infant. Pediatric Use Allergenic extracts have been used in children over two years of age.(5)</td></tr>

The use of allergenic extracts for therapeutic purpose has been established by wellcontrolled clinical studies. Allergenic extracts may be used as adjunctive therapy along with pharmacotherapy which includes antihistamines, corticosteroids, and cromoglycate, and avoidance measures. Allergenic extracts for therapeutic use should be given using only the allergen selection to which the patient is allergic, has a history of exposure and are likely to be exposed to again.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS DO NOT INJECT INTRAVENOUSLY. Epinephrine 11000 should be available. Concentrated extracts must be diluted with sterile diluent prior to first use on a patient for treatment or intradermal testing. All concentrates of glycerinated allergenic extracts have the ability to cause serious local and systemic reactions including death in sensitive patients. Sensitive patients may experience severe anaphylactic reactions resulting in respiratory obstruction, shock, coma and or death.(4) (See Adverse Reactions) An allergenic extract should be temporarily withheld from patients or the dose of the extract adjusted downward if any of the following conditions exist (1) Severe symptoms of rhinitis andor asthma (2) Infections or flu accompanied by fever and (3) Exposure to excessive amounts of clinically relevant allergen prior to a scheduled injection. When switching patients to a new lot of the same extract the initial dose should be reduced 34 so that 25 of previous dose is administered.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse systemic reactions usually occur within minutes and consist primarily of allergic symptoms such as generalized skin erythema, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, rhinitis, wheezing, laryngeal edema, itching of nose and throat, breathlessness, dyspnea, coughing, hypotension and marked perspiration. Less commonly, nausea, emesis, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and uterine contractions may occur. Severe reactions may cause anaphylaxis or shock and loss of consciousness and rarely death. The treatment of systemic allergic reactions is dependent upon the system complex. Antihistamines may offer relief of recurrent urticaria, associated skin reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. Corticosteroids may provide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent. (See Overdose section) Local Reactions consisting of erythema, itching, swelling tenderness and sometimes pain may occur at the injection site. These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several days. Local cold applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment. For marked and prolonged local reactions the use of antihistamines or antiinflammatory medications may be dictated. Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report can be filed to MedWatch, The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program, at 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 208529787, call 1800FDA1088.</td></tr>

When allergenic extracts are administered for diagnostic use, the dosage is dependent upon the method used. Two methods commonly used are scratch testing and intradermal testing. Both types of tests result in a wheal and flare response at the site of the test which usually develops rapidly and may be read in 2030 minutes. Diagnostic Use  Scratch Testing Method Scratch testing is considered a simple and safe method although less sensitive than the intradermal test. Scratch testing can be used to determine the degree of sensitivity to a suspected allergen before using the intradermal test. This combination lessens the severity of response to an allergen which can occur in a very sensitive patient. The most satisfactory testing site is the patients back or volar surface of the arms from the axilla to 2.5 or 5cm above the wrist, skipping the anticubital space. If using the back as a testing site, the most satisfactory area are from the posterior axillary fold to 2.5 cm from the spinal column, and from the top of the scapula to the lower rib margins. Allergenic extracts for diagnostic use are to be administered in the following manner To scratch surface of skin, use a circular scarifier. Do not draw blood. Tests sites should be 4 cm apart to allow for wheal and flare reaction. 130 scratch tests may be done at a time. A separate sterile scratch instrument is to be used on each patient to prevent transmission of homologous serum hepatitis or other infectious agents from one patient to another. The recommended usual dosage for Scratch testing is one drop of allergen applied to each scratch site. Do not let dropper touch skin. Always apply a control scratch with each test set. Sterile Diluent (for a negative control) is used in exactly the same way as an active test extract. Histamine may be used as a positive control. Scratch or prick test sites should be examined at 15 and 30 minutes. To prevent excessive absorption, wipe off antigens producing large reactions as soon as the wheal appears. Record the size of the reaction. Interpretation of Scratch Test Skin tests are graded in terms of the wheal and erythema response noted at 10 to 20 minutes. Wheal and erythema size may be recorded by actual measurement as compared with positive and negative controls. A positive reaction consists of an area of erythema surrounding the scarification that is larger than the control site. For uniformity in reporting reactions, the following system is recommended. (6) REACTION SYMBOL CRITERIA Negative  No wheal. Erythema absent or very slight (not more than 1 mm diameter). One Plus  Wheal absent or very slight erythema present (not more than 3 mm diameter). Two Plus  Wheal not more than 3mm or erythema not more than 5mm diameter. Three Plus  Wheal between 3mm and 5mm diameter, with erythema. Possible pseudopodia and itching. Four Plus  A larger reaction with itching and pain. Diagnostic Use Intradermal Skin Testing Method Do not perform intradermal test with allergens which have evoked a 2 or greater response to a Scratch test. Clean test area with alcohol, place sites 5 cm apart using separate sterile tuberculin syringe and a 25 gauge needle for each allergen. Insert needle tip, bevel up, into intracutaneous space. Avoid injecting into blood vessel, pull back gently on syringe plunger, if blood enters syringe change position of needle. The recommended dosage and range for intradermal testing is 0.05 ml of not more than 100 pnuml or 11000 wv (only if puncture test is negative) of allergenic extract. Inject slowly until a small bleb is raised. It is important to make each bleb the same size. Interpretation of Intradermal Test The patients reaction is graded on the basis of size of wheal and flare as compared to control. Use 0.05 ml sterile diluent as a negative control to give accurate interpretation. The tests may be accurately interpreted only when the saline control site has shown a negative response. Observe patient for at least 30 minutes. Tests can be read in 1520 minutes. Edema, erythema and presence of pseudopods, pain and itching may be observed in 4 plus reactions. For uniformity in reporting reactions the following system is recommended. (6) REACTION SYMBOL CRITERIA Negative  No increase in size of bleb since injection. No erythema. One Plus  An increase in size of bleb to a wheal not more than 5mm diameter, with associated erythema. Two Plus  Wheal between 5mm and 8mm diameter with erythema. Three Plus  Wheal between 8mm and 12mm diameter with erythema and possible pseudopodia and itching or pain. Four Plus  Any larger reaction with itch and pain, and possible diffuse blush of the skin surrounding the reaction area. Therapeutic Use Recommended dosage  range Check the listed ingredients to verify that it matches the prescription ordered. When using a prescription set, verify the patients name and the ingredients listed with the prescription order. Assess the patients physical and emotional status prior to giving as injection. Do not give injections to patients who are in acute distress. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Dosage of allergenic extracts is a highly individualized matter and varies according to the degree of sensitivity of the patient, his clinical response and tolerance to the extract administered during the early phases of an injection regimen. The dosage must be reduced when transferring a patient from nonstandardized or modified extract to standardized extract. Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a reduction in dosage during the initial stages of immunotherapy as well as during maintenance therapy. After therapeutic injections patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes for reaction symptoms. SUGGESTED DOSAGE SCHEDULE The following schedule may act as a guide. This schedule has not been proven to be safe or effective. Sensitive patients may begin with smaller doses of weaker solutions and the dosage increments can be less. STRENGTH DOSE VOLUME Vial 1 1 0.05 1100,000 wv 2 0.10 10 pnuml 3 0.15 1 AUml 4 0.20 1 BAUml 5 0.30 6 0.40 7 0.50 Vial 2 8 0.05 110,000 wv 9 0.10 100 pnuml 10 0.15 10 AUml 11 0.20 10 BAUml 12 0.30 13 0.40 14 0.50 Vial 3 15 0.05 11,000 wv 16 0.10 1,000 pnuml 17 0.15 100 AUml 18 0.20 100 BAUml 19 0.30 20 0.40 21 0.50 Vial 4 22 0.05 1100 wv 23 0.07 10,000 pnuml 24 0.10 1,000 AUml 25 0.15 1,000 BAUml 26 0.20 27 0.25 Maintenance Refill 28 0.25 1100 wv 29 0.25 10,000 pnuml 30 0.25 1,000 AUml 31 0.25 1,000 BAUml 32 0.25 subsequent doses 33 0.25 Preparation Instructions All dilutions may be made using sterile buffered diluent. The calculation may be based on the following ratio Volume desired x Concentration desired  Volume needed x Concentration available. Example 1 If a 110 wv extract is available and it is desired to use a 11,000 wv extract substitute as follows Vd x Cd  Vn x Ca 10ml x 0.001  Vn x 0.1 0.1 ml  Vn Using a sterile technique, remove 0.10 ml of extract from the 110 vial and place it into a vial containing 9.90 ml of sterile diluent. The resulting ratio will be a 10 ml vial of 11,000 wv. Example 2 If a 10,000 pnuml extract is available and it is desired to use a 100 pnuml extract substitute as follows 10ml x 100  Vn x 10,000 0.1 ml  Vn Using a sterile technique, remove 0.10 ml of extract from the 10,000 pnuml vial and place it into a vial containing 9.90 ml of sterile diluent. The resulting concentration will be a 10 ml vial of 100 pnuml. Example 3 If a 10,000 AUml or BAUml extract is available and it is desired to use a 100 AUml or BAUml extract substitute as follows Vd x Cd  Vn x Ca 10ml x 100  Vn x 10,000 0.1 ml  Vn Using a sterile technique, remove 0.10 ml of extract from the 10,000 AUml or BAUml vial and place it into a vial containing 9.90 ml of sterile diluent. The resulting concentration will be 10ml vial of 100 AUml or BAUml. Intervals between doses The optimal interval between doses of allergenic extract has not been definitely established. The amount of allergenic extract is increased at each injection by not more than 50100 of the previous amount and the next increment is governed by the response to the last injection. There are three generally accepted methods of pollen hyposensitizing therapy. 1. PRESEASONAL Treatment starts each year 6 to 8 weeks before onset of seasonal symptoms. Maximal dose reached just before symptoms are expected. Injections discontinued during and following season until next year. 2. COSEASONAL Patient is first treated during season with symptoms. Low initial doses are employed to prevent worsening of condition. This is followed by an intensive schedule of therapy (i.e. injections given 2 to 3 times per week). Fewer Allergists are resorting to this Coseasonal therapy because of the availability of more effective, symptomatic medications that allow the patient to go through a season relatively symptom free. 3. PERENNIAL Initially this is the same as pre seasonal. The allergen is administered twice weekly or weekly for about 20 injections to achieve the maximum tolerated dose. Then, maintenance therapy may be administered once a week or less frequently. Duration of Treatment The usual duration of treatment has not been established. A period of two or three years of injection therapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The pharmacological action of allergenic extracts used diagnostically is based on the liberation of histamine and other substances when the allergen reacts with IgE antibodies attached to the mast cells. When allergenic extracts are used for immunotherapy, the effect is an increase in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and an increased T suppresser lymphocyte which interferes with the allergic response.(2) With repeated administration of allergenic extracts changes develop in regards to IgG and IgE production and mediatorreleasing cells. The histamine release response is reduced in some patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>WARNING Diagnostic and therapeutic allergenic extracts are intended to be administered by a physician who is an allergy specialist and experienced in allergenic diagnostic testing and immunotherapy and the emergency care of anaphylaxis. This product should not be injected intravenously. Deep subcutaneous routes have been safe. Sensitive patients may experience severe anaphylactic reactions resulting in respiratory obstruction, shock, coma andor death. (See Adverse Reactions) Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report filed to MedWatch, The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program, at 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 208529787, call 1800FDA1088. Extreme caution should be taken when using allergenic extracts for patients who are taking betablocker medications. In the event of a serious adverse reaction associated with the use of allergenic extracts, patients receiving betablockers may not be responsive to epinephrine or inhaled brochodialators.(1) (See Precautions) Allergenic extracts should be used with caution for patients with unstable or steroiddependent asthma or underlying cardiovascular disease. (See Contraindications)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>storage_and_handling</i>:</td><td>STORAGE The expiration date of allergen extracts is listed on the container label. Store extracts upon arrival at 2 to 8C and keep them in this range during office use. WARRANTY We warrant that this product was prepared and tested according to the standards of the FDA and is true to label. Because of biological differences in individuals and because allergenic extracts are manufactured to be potent and because we have no control over the conditions of use, we cannot and do not warrant either a good effect or against an ill effect following use.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Overdose can cause both local and systemic reactions. An overdose may be prevented by careful observation and questioning of the patient about the previous injection. If systemic or anaphylactic reaction, does occur, apply a tourniquet above the site of injection and inject intramuscularly or subcutaneously 0.3 to 0.5ml of 11000 Epinephrine Hydrochloride into the opposite arm. The dose may be repeated in 510 minutes if necessary. Loosen the tourniquet at least every 10 minutes. The Epinephrine Hydrochloride 11000 dose for infants to 2 years is 0.05 to 0.1 ml, for children 2 to 6 years it is 0.15 ml, for children 612 years it is 0.2 ml. Patients unresponsive to Epinephrine may be treated with Theophylline. Studies on asthmatic subjects reveal that plasma concentrations of Theophylline of 5 to 20 gml are associated with therapeutic effects. Toxicity is particularly apparent at concentrations greater than 20 gml. A loading dose of Aminophylline of 5.8 mgkg intravenously followed by 0.9 mgkg per hour results in plasma concentrations of approximately 10 gml for patients not previously receiving theophylline. (Mitenko and Ogilive, Nicholoson and Chick,1973) Other betaadrenergic drugs such as Isoproterenol, Isoetharine, or Albuterol may be used by inhalation. The usual dose to relieve bronchoconstriction in asthma is 0.5 ml of the 0.5 solution for Isoproterenol HCl. The Albuterol inhaler delivers approximately 90 mcg of Albuterol from the mouthpiece. The usual dosage for adults and children would be two inhalations repeated every 46 hours. Isoetharine supplied in the Bronkometer unit delivers approximately 340 mcg Isoetharine. The average dose is one to two inhalations. Respiratory obstruction not responding to parenteral or inhaled bronchodilators may require oxygen, intubation and the use of life support systems.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS General Adverse reactions to corticosteroids may be produced by too rapid withdrawal or by continued use of large doses. To avoid druginduced adrenal insufficiency, supportive dosage may be required in times of stress (such as trauma, surgery, or severe illness) both during treatment with fludrocortisone acetate and for a year afterwards. There is an enhanced corticosteroid effect in patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition being treated. A gradual reduction in dosage should be made when possible. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used. These may range from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may also be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients with hypoprothrombinemia. Corticosteroids should be used with caution in patients with nonspecific ulcerative colitis if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infection. Corticosteroids should also be used cautiously in patients with diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis. Information for Patients The physician should advise the patient to report any medical history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or kidney or liver disease and to report current use of any medicines to determine if these medicines might interact adversely with fludrocortisone acetate (see Drug Interactions ). Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice. The patients understanding of his steroiddependent status and increased dosage requirement under widely variable conditions of stress is vital. Advise the patient to carry medical identification indicating his dependence on steroid medication and, if necessary, instruct him to carry an adequate supply of medication for use in emergencies. Stress to the patient the importance of regular followup visits to check his progress and the need to promptly notify the physician of dizziness, severe or continuing headaches, swelling of feet or lower legs, or unusual weight gain. Advise the patient to use the medicine only as directed, to take a missed dose as soon a possible unless it is almost time for the next dose, and not to double the next dose. Inform the patient to keep this medication and all drugs out of the reach of children. Laboratory Tests Patients should be monitored regularly for blood pressure determinations and serum electrolyte determinations (see WARNINGS ). Drug Interactions When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with adrenal corticosteroids. Amphortericin B or potassiumdepleting diuretics (benzothiadiazines and related drugs, ethacrynic acid and furosemide)enhanced hypokalemia. Check serum potassium levels at frequent intervals use potassium supplements if necessary (see WARNINGS ). Digitalis glycosides enhanced possibility of arrhythmias or digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia. Monitor serum potassium levels use potassium supplements if necessary. Oral anticoagulants decreased prothrombin time response. Monitor prothrombin levels and adjust anticoagulant dosage accordingly. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)diminished antidiabetic effect. Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia adjust dosage of antidiabetic drug upward if necessary. Aspirin increased ulcerogenic effect decreased pharmacologic effect of aspirin. Rarely salicylate toxicity may occur in patients who discontinue steroids after concurrent highdose aspirin therapy. Monitor salicylate levels or the therapeutic effect for which aspirin is given adjust salicylate dosage accordingly if effect is altered (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Barbiturates, phenytoin, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of fludrocortisone acetate because of the induction of hepatic enzymes. Observe the patient for possible diminished effect of steroid and increase the steroid dosage accordingly. Anabolic steroids (particularly C17 alkylated androgens such as oxymetholone, methandrostenolone, norethandrolone, and similar compounds) enhanced tendency toward edema. Use caution when giving these drugs together, especially in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease. Vaccines neurological complications and lack of antibody response (see WARNINGS ). Estrogen increased levels of corticosteroidbinding globulin thereby increasing the bound (inactive) fraction this effect is at least balanced by decreased metabolism of corticosteroids. When estrogen therapy is initiated, a reduction in corticosteroid dosage may be required, and increased amounts may be required when estrogen is terminated. DrugLaboratory Test Interactions Corticosteroids may affect the nitrobluetetrazolium test for bacterial infection and produce falsenegative results. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Adequate studies have not been performed in animals to determine whether fludrocortisone acetate has carcinogenic or mutagenic activity or whether it affects fertility in males or females.

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS BECAUSE OF ITS MARKED EFFECT ON SODIUM RETENTION THE USE OF FLUDROCORTISONE ACETATE IN THE TREATMENT OF CONDITIONS OTHER THAN THOSE INDICATED HEREIN IS NOT ADVISED. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. If an infection occurs during fludrocortisone acetate therapy, it should be promptly controlled by suitable antimicorbial therapy. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. However, since fludrocortisone acetate is a potent mineralocorticoid, both the dosage and salt intake should be carefully monitored in order to avoid the development of hypertension, edema or weight gain. Periodic checking of serum electrolyte levels is advisable during prolonged therapy dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox while on corticosteroid therapy. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of fludrocortisone acetate in patients with active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary since reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with variicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids are thought to act at least in part, by controlling the rate of synthesis of proteins. Although there are a number of instances in which the synthesis of specific proteins is known to be induced by corticosteroids, the links between the initial actions of the hormones and the final metabolic effects have not been completely elucidated. The physiologic action of fludrocortisone acetate is similar to that of hydrocortisone. However, the effects of fludrocortisone acetate, particularly on electrolyte balance, but also on carbohydrate metabolism, are considerably heightened and prolonged. Mineralocorticoids act on the distal tubules of the kidney to enhance the reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubular fluid into the plasma they increase the urinary excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. The consequence of these three primary effects together with similar actions on cation transport in other tissues appear to account for the entire spectrum of physiological activities that are characteristic of mineralocorticoids. In small oral doses, fludrocortisone acetate produces marked sodium retention and increased urinary potassium excretion. It also causes a rise in blood pressure, apparently because of these effects on electrolyte levels. In larger doses, fludrocortisone acetate inhibits endogenous adrenal cortical secretion, thymic activity, and pituitary corticotropin excretion promotes the deposition of liver glycogen and, unless protein intake is adequate, induces negative nitrogen balance. The approximate plasma halflife of fludrocortisone (fluorohydrocortisone) is 3.5 hours or more and the biological halflife is 18 to 36 hours.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Development of hypertension, edema, hypokalemia, excessive increase in weight, and increase in heart size are signs of overdosage of fludrocortisone acetate. When these are noted, administration of drugs should be discontinued, after which the symptoms will usually subside within several days subsequent treatment with fludrocortisone acetate should be with a reduced dose. Muscular weakness may develop due to excessive potassium loss and can be treated by administering a potassium supplement. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and serum electrolytes can help to prevent overdosage (see WARNINGS ).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism In man, absorption of an oral dose is rapid and consistent but incomplete. Approximately 50 of an oral dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, the remainder being excreted unchanged in the feces. Peak blood levels are reached between two (2) and four (4) hours after ingestion. Unlike propranolol or metoprolol, but like nadolol, atenolol undergoes little or no metabolism by the liver, and the absorbed portion is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Over 85 of an intravenous dose is excreted in urine within 24 hours compared with approximately 50 for an oral dose. Atenolol also differs from propranolol in that only a small amount (6 to 16) is bound to proteins in the plasma. This kinetic profile results in relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about a 4fold interpatient variation. The elimination halflife of oral atenolol is approximately 6 to 7 hours, and there is no alteration of the kinetic profile of the drug by chronic administration. Following intravenous administration, peak plasma levels are reached within 5 minutes. Declines from peak levels are rapid (5 to 10fold) during the first 7 hours thereafter, plasma levels decay with a halflife similar to that of orally administered drug. Following oral doses of 50 mg or 100 mg, both betablocking and antihypertensive effects persist for at least 24 hours. When renal function is impaired, elimination of atenolol is closely related to the glomerular filtration rate significant accumulation occurs when the creatinine clearance falls below 35 mLmin1.73m2 (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS General Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before atenolol is administered. Initial and subsequent atenolol dosages can be adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Atenolol may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders. Impaired Renal Function The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Drug Interactions Catecholaminedepleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with betablocking agents. Patients treated with atenolol plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension andor marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with atenolol (see WARNINGS). Disopyramide is a Type l antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with betablockers. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with betablockers. Beta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by betablocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped. Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, e.g., indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of betablockers. Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited. Data from several studies, i.e., TIMIII, ISIS2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting. While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction. Both digitalis glycosides and betablockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two longterm (maximum dosing duration of 18 or 24 months) rat studies and one longterm (maximum dosing duration of 18 months) mouse study, each employing dose levels as high as 300 mgkgday or 150 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose, did not indicate a carcinogenic potential of atenolol. A third (24 month) rat study, employing doses of 500 and 1,500 mgkgday (250 and 750 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose) resulted in increased incidences of benign adrenal medullary tumors in males and females, mammary fibroadenomas in females, and anterior pituitary adenomas and thyroid parafollicular cell carcinomas in males. No evidence of a mutagenic potential of atenolol was uncovered in the dominant lethal test (mouse), in vivo cytogenetics test (Chinese hamster) or Ames test (S. typhimurium). Fertility of male or female rats (evaluated at dose levels as high as 200 mgkgday or 100 times the maximum recommended human dose) was unaffected by atenolol administration. Animal Toxicology Chronic studies employing oral atenolol performed in animals have revealed the occurrence of vacuolation of epithelial cells of Brunners glands in the duodenum of both male and female dogs at all tested dose levels of atenolol (starting at 15 mgkgday or 7.5 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose) and increased incidence of atrial degeneration of hearts of male rats at 300 but not 150 mg atenololkgday (150 and 75 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose, respectively).  Based on the maximum dose of 100 mgday in a 50 kg patient. Usage in Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D See WARNINGS Pregnancy and Fetal Injury. Nursing Mothers Atenolol is excreted in human breast milk at a ratio of 1.5 to 6.8 when compared to the concentration in plasma. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in breast fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects. Neonates born to mothers who are receiving atenolol at parturition or breastfeeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia and bradycardia. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is administered during pregnancy or to a woman who is breastfeeding. (See WARNINGS Pregnancy and Fetal Injury.) Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Hypertension and Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis Clinical studies of atenolol did not include sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Acute Myocardial Infarction Of the 8,037 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomized to atenolol in the ISIS1 trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), 33 (2,644) were 65 years of age and older. It was not possible to identify significant differences in the efficacy and safety between older and younger patients however, elderly patients with systolic blood pressure  120 mm Hg seemed less likely to benefit (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>"INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Atenolol tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programs Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Atenolol tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis Atenolol tablets are indicated for the longterm management of patients with angina pectoris. Acute Myocardial Infarction Atenolol tablets are indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality. Treatment can be initiated as soon as the patients clinical condition allows. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS.) In general, there is no basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the ISIS1 trial (blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg systolic, heart rate less than 50 bpm) or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade. As noted above, some subgroups (e.g., elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg) seemed less likely to benefit."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension The initial dose of atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit. Atenolol tablets may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents including thiazidetype diuretics, hydralazine, prazosin, and alphamethyldopa. Angina Pectoris The initial dose of atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. Twentyfour hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 mg to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50 to 75 of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg. Acute Myocardial Infarction In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with atenolol I.V. injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patients arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patients hemodynamic condition has stabilized. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. Atenolol I.V. injection should be administered under carefully controlled conditions including monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram. Dilutions of atenolol I.V. injection in Dextrose Injection USP, Sodium Chloride Injection USP, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection may be used. These admixtures are stable for 48 hours if they are not used immediately. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), atenolol tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, atenolol tablets can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6 to 9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, atenolol tablets should be discontinued. (See full prescribing information prior to initiating therapy with atenolol tablets.) Data from other beta blocker trials suggest that if there is any question concerning the use of IV beta blocker or clinical estimate that there is a contraindication, the IV beta blocker may be eliminated and patients fulfilling the safety criteria may be given atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once a day for at least seven days (if the IV dosing is excluded). Although the demonstration of efficacy of atenolol is based entirely on data from the first seven postinfarction days, data from other beta blocker trials suggest that treatment with beta blockers that are effective in the postinfarction setting may be continued for one to three years if there are no contraindications. Atenolol tablets are an additional treatment to standard coronary care unit therapy. Elderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment Atenolol is excreted by the kidneys consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function. Atenolol excretion would be expected to decrease with advancing age. No significant accumulation of atenolol occurs until creatinine clearance falls below 35 mLmin1.73 m2. Accumulation of atenolol and prolongation of its halflife were studied in subjects with creatinine clearance between 5 and 105 mLmin. Peak plasma levels were significantly increased in subjects with creatinine clearances below 30 mLmin. The following maximum oral dosages are recommended for elderly, renallyimpaired patients and for patients with renal impairment due to other causes Creatinine Clearance (mLmin1.73m2) Atenolol Elimination HalfLife (hrs) Maximum Dosage 15 to 35 16 to 27 50 mg daily  15  27 25 mg daily Some renallyimpaired or elderly patients being treated for hypertension may require a lower starting dose of atenolol 25 mg given as one tablet a day. If this 25 mg dose is used, assessment of efficacy must be made carefully. This should include measurement of blood pressure just prior to the next dose ("trough" blood pressure) to ensure that the treatment effect is present for a full 24 hours. Although a similar dosage reduction may be considered for elderly andor renallyimpaired patients being treated for indications other than hypertension, data are not available for these patient populations. Patients on hemodialysis should be given 25 mg or 50 mg after each dialysis this should be done under hospital supervision as marked falls in blood pressure can occur. Cessation of Therapy in Patients with Angina Pectoris If withdrawal of atenolol tablets therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually and patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum., Elderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment Atenolol is excreted by the kidneys consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Atenolol, like other beta blockers, has been associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), lupus syndrome and Raynauds phenomenon. Potential Adverse Effects In addition, a variety of adverse effects have been reported with other betaadrenergic blocking agents, and may be considered potential adverse effects of atenolol. Hematologic Agranulocytosis. Allergic Fever, combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress.

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation is necessary in supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, cardiac failure which is not promptly and effectively controlled by 80 mg of intravenous furosemide or equivalent therapy is a contraindication to betablocker treatment. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure Continued depression of the myocardium with betablocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be treated appropriately according to currently recommended guidelines, and the response observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate treatment, atenolol should be withdrawn. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Cessation of Therapy With Atenolol Patients with coronary artery disease, who are being treated with atenolol, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in angina patients following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta blockers. The last two complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other beta blockers, when discontinuation of atenolol is planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that atenolol be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue atenolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Concomitant Use of Calcium Channel Blockers Bradycardia and heart block can occur and the left ventricular end diastolic pressure can rise when beta blockers are administered with verapamil or diltiazem. Patients with preexisting conduction abnormalities or left ventricular dysfunction are particularly susceptible (see PRECAUTIONS). Bronchospastic Diseases PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA BLOCKERS. Because of its relative beta1 selectivity, however, atenolol may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Since beta1 selectivity is not absolute, the lowest possible dose of atenolol should be used with therapy initiated at 50 mg and a beta2stimulating agent (bronchodilator) should be made available. If dosage must be increased, dividing the dose should be considered in order to achieve lower peak blood levels. Major Surgery Chronically administered betablocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> and Hypoglycemia Atenolol should be used with caution in diabetic patients if a betablocking agent is required. Beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. At recommended doses atenolol does not potentiate insulininduced hypoglycemia and, unlike nonselective beta blockers, does not delay recovery of blood glucose to normal levels. Thyrotoxicosis Betaadrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm therefore, patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis from whom atenolol therapy is to be withdrawn should be monitored closely. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Untreated Pheochromocytoma Atenolol should not be given to patients with untreated pheochromocytoma. Pregnancy and Fetal Injury Atenolol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Atenolol crosses the placental barrier and appears in cord blood. Administration of atenolol, starting in the second trimester of pregnancy, has been associated with the birth of infants that are small for gestational age. No studies have been performed on the use of atenolol in the first trimester and the possibility of fetal injury cannot be excluded. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Neonates born to mothers who are receiving atenolol at parturition or breastfeeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia and bradycardia. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is administered during pregnancy or to a woman who is breastfeeding. (See PRECAUTIONS Nursing Mothers.) Atenolol has been shown to produce a dose related increase in embryofetal resorptions in rats at doses equal to or greater than 50 mgkgday or 25 or more times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose. Although similar effects were not seen in rabbits, the compound was not evaluated in rabbits at doses above 25 mgkgday or 12.5 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose.  Based on the maximum dose of 100 mgday in a 50 kg patient.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Geriatric Use Hypertension and Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis Clinical studies of atenolol did not include sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Acute Myocardial Infarction Of the 8,037 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomized to atenolol in the ISIS1 trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), 33 (2,644) were 65 years of age and older. It was not possible to identify significant differences in the efficacy and safety between older and younger patients however, elderly patients with systolic blood pressure  120 mm Hg seemed less likely to benefit (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Atenolol is a beta1selective (cardioselective) betaadrenergic receptor blocking agent without membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic (partial agonist) activities. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher doses, atenolol inhibits beta2adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism In man, absorption of an oral dose is rapid and consistent but incomplete. Approximately 50 of an oral dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, the remainder being excreted unchanged in the feces. Peak blood levels are reached between two (2) and four (4) hours after ingestion. Unlike propranolol or metoprolol, but like nadolol, atenolol undergoes little or no metabolism by the liver, and the absorbed portion is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Over 85 of an intravenous dose is excreted in urine within 24 hours compared with approximately 50 for an oral dose. Atenolol also differs from propranolol in that only a small amount (6 to 16) is bound to proteins in the plasma. This kinetic profile results in relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about a 4fold interpatient variation. The elimination halflife of oral atenolol is approximately 6 to 7 hours, and there is no alteration of the kinetic profile of the drug by chronic administration. Following intravenous administration, peak plasma levels are reached within 5 minutes. Declines from peak levels are rapid (5 to 10fold) during the first 7 hours thereafter, plasma levels decay with a halflife similar to that of orally administered drug. Following oral doses of 50 mg or 100 mg, both betablocking and antihypertensive effects persist for at least 24 hours. When renal function is impaired, elimination of atenolol is closely related to the glomerular filtration rate significant accumulation occurs when the creatinine clearance falls below 35 mLmin1.73m2 (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Pharmacodynamics In standard animal or human pharmacological tests, betaadrenoreceptor blocking activity of atenolol has been demonstrated by (1) reduction in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction in reflex orthostatic tachycardia. A significant betablocking effect of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise tachycardia, is apparent within one hour following oral administration of a single dose. This effect is maximal at about 2 to 4 hours, and persists for at least 24 hours. Maximum reduction in exercise tachycardia occurs within 5 minutes of an intravenous dose. For both orally and intravenously administered drug, the duration of action is dose related and also bears a linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma atenolol concentration. The effect on exercise tachycardia of a single 10 mg intravenous dose is largely dissipated by 12 hours, whereas betablocking activity of single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg is still evident beyond 24 hours following administration. However, as has been shown for all betablocking agents, the antihypertensive effect does not appear to be related to plasma level. In normal subjects, the beta1selectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent betablocking doses of propranolol. In asthmatic patients, a dose of atenolol producing a greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance. In a placebo controlled comparison of approximately equipotent oral doses of several beta blockers, atenolol produced a significantly smaller decrease of FEV1 than nonselective beta blockers such as propranolol and, unlike those agents, did not inhibit bronchodilation in response to isoproterenol. Consistent with its negative chronotropic effect due to beta blockade of the SA node, atenolol increases sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. Conduction in the AV node is also prolonged. Atenolol is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity, and increasing the dose well beyond that producing beta blockade does not further depress myocardial contractility. Several studies have demonstrated a moderate (approximately 10) increase in stroke volume at rest and during exercise. In controlled clinical trials, atenolol, given as a single daily oral dose, was an effective antihypertensive agent providing 24hour reduction of blood pressure. Atenolol has been studied in combination with thiazidetype diuretics, and the blood pressure effects of the combination are approximately additive. Atenolol is also compatible with methyldopa, hydralazine, and prazosin, each combination resulting in a larger fall in blood pressure than with the single agents. The dose range of atenolol is narrow and increasing the dose beyond 100 mg once daily is not associated with increased antihypertensive effect. The mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of betablocking agents have not been established. Several possible mechanisms have been proposed and include (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output, (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin activity. The results from longterm studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol with prolonged use. By blocking the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines and by decreasing blood pressure, atenolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, making it useful for many patients in the longterm management of angina pectoris. On the other hand, atenolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure, particularly in patients with heart failure. In a multicenter clinical trial (ISIS1) conducted in 16,027 patients with suspected myocardial infarction, patients presenting within 12 hours (mean  5 hours) after the onset of pain were randomized to either conventional therapy plus atenolol (n  8,037), or conventional therapy alone (n  7,990). Patients with a heart rate of  50 bpm or systolic blood pressure  100 mm Hg, or with other contraindications to beta blockade, were excluded. Thirtyeight percent of each group were treated within 4 hours of onset of pain. The mean time from onset of pain to entry was 5.0  2.7 hours in both groups. Patients in the atenolol group were to receive atenolol I.V. injection 5 mg to 10 mg given over 5 minutes plus atenolol tablets 50 mg every 12 hours orally on the first study day (the first oral dose administered about 15 minutes after the I.V. dose) followed by either atenolol tablets 100 mg once daily or atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily on days 2 to 7. The groups were similar in demographic and medical history characteristics and in electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction, bundle branch block, and first degree atrioventricular block at entry. During the treatment period (days 0 to 7), the vascular mortality rates were 3.89 in the atenolol group (313 deaths) and 4.57 in the control group (365 deaths). This absolute difference in rates, 0.68, is statistically significant at the P  0.05 level. The absolute difference translates into a proportional reduction of 15 (3.89 to 4.57)4.57  0.15. The 95 confidence limits are 1 to 27. Most of the difference was attributed to mortality in days 0 to 1 (atenolol  121 deaths control  171 deaths). Despite the large size of the ISIS1 trial, it is not possible to identify clearly subgroups of patients most likely or least likely to benefit from early treatment with atenolol. Good clinical judgment suggests, however, that patients who are dependent on sympathetic stimulation for maintenance of adequate cardiac output and blood pressure are not good candidates for beta blockade. Indeed, the trial protocol reflected that judgment by excluding patients with blood pressure consistently below 100 mm Hg systolic. The overall results of the study are compatible with the possibility that patients with borderline blood pressure (less than 120 mm Hg systolic), especially if over 60 years of age, are less likely to benefit. The mechanism through which atenolol improves survival in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction is unknown, as is the case for other beta blockers in the postinfarction setting. Atenolol, in addition to its effects on survival, has shown other clinical benefits including reduced frequency of ventricular premature beats, reduced chest pain, and reduced enzyme elevation. Atenolol Geriatric Pharmacology In general, elderly patients present higher atenolol plasma levels with total clearance values about 50 lower than younger subjects. The halflife is markedly longer in the elderly compared to younger subjects. The reduction in atenolol clearance follows the general trend that the elimination of renally excreted drugs is decreased with increasing age.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>"OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with atenolol has been reported with patients surviving acute doses as high as 5 g. One death was reported in a man who may have taken as much as 10 g acutely. The predominant symptoms reported following atenolol overdose are lethargy, disorder of respiratory drive, wheezing, sinus pause and bradycardia. Additionally, common effects associated with overdosage of any betaadrenergic blocking agent and which might also be expected in atenolol overdose are congestive heart failure, hypotension, bronchospasm andor hypoglycemia. Treatment of overdose should be directed to the removal of any unabsorbed drug by induced emesis, gastric lavage, or administration of activated charcoal. Atenolol can be removed from the general circulation by hemodialysis. Other treatment modalities should be employed at the physicians discretion and may include Bradycardia Atropine intravenously. If there is no response to vagal blockade, give isoproterenol cautiously. In refractory cases, a transvenous cardiac pacemaker may be indicated. Heart Block (second or third degree) Isoproterenol or transvenous cardiac pacemaker. Cardiac Failure Digitalize the patient and administer a diuretic. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. Hypotension Vasopressors such as dopamine or norepinephrine (levarterenol). Monitor blood pressure continuously. Bronchospasm A beta2 stimulant such as isoproterenol or terbutaline andor aminophylline. Hypoglycemia Intravenous glucose. Based on the severity of symptoms, management may require intensive support care and facilities for applying cardiac and respiratory support."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>Pharmacodynamics In standard animal or human pharmacological tests, betaadrenoreceptor blocking activity of atenolol has been demonstrated by (1) reduction in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction in reflex orthostatic tachycardia. A significant betablocking effect of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise tachycardia, is apparent within one hour following oral administration of a single dose. This effect is maximal at about 2 to 4 hours, and persists for at least 24 hours. Maximum reduction in exercise tachycardia occurs within 5 minutes of an intravenous dose. For both orally and intravenously administered drug, the duration of action is dose related and also bears a linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma atenolol concentration. The effect on exercise tachycardia of a single 10 mg intravenous dose is largely dissipated by 12 hours, whereas betablocking activity of single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg is still evident beyond 24 hours following administration. However, as has been shown for all betablocking agents, the antihypertensive effect does not appear to be related to plasma level. In normal subjects, the beta1selectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent betablocking doses of propranolol. In asthmatic patients, a dose of atenolol producing a greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance. In a placebo controlled comparison of approximately equipotent oral doses of several beta blockers, atenolol produced a significantly smaller decrease of FEV1 than nonselective beta blockers such as propranolol and, unlike those agents, did not inhibit bronchodilation in response to isoproterenol. Consistent with its negative chronotropic effect due to beta blockade of the SA node, atenolol increases sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. Conduction in the AV node is also prolonged. Atenolol is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity, and increasing the dose well beyond that producing beta blockade does not further depress myocardial contractility. Several studies have demonstrated a moderate (approximately 10) increase in stroke volume at rest and during exercise. In controlled clinical trials, atenolol, given as a single daily oral dose, was an effective antihypertensive agent providing 24hour reduction of blood pressure. Atenolol has been studied in combination with thiazidetype diuretics, and the blood pressure effects of the combination are approximately additive. Atenolol is also compatible with methyldopa, hydralazine, and prazosin, each combination resulting in a larger fall in blood pressure than with the single agents. The dose range of atenolol is narrow and increasing the dose beyond 100 mg once daily is not associated with increased antihypertensive effect. The mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of betablocking agents have not been established. Several possible mechanisms have been proposed and include (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output, (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin activity. The results from longterm studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol with prolonged use. By blocking the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines and by decreasing blood pressure, atenolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, making it useful for many patients in the longterm management of angina pectoris. On the other hand, atenolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure, particularly in patients with heart failure. In a multicenter clinical trial (ISIS1) conducted in 16,027 patients with suspected myocardial infarction, patients presenting within 12 hours (mean  5 hours) after the onset of pain were randomized to either conventional therapy plus atenolol (n  8,037), or conventional therapy alone (n  7,990). Patients with a heart rate of  50 bpm or systolic blood pressure  100 mm Hg, or with other contraindications to beta blockade, were excluded. Thirtyeight percent of each group were treated within 4 hours of onset of pain. The mean time from onset of pain to entry was 5.0  2.7 hours in both groups. Patients in the atenolol group were to receive atenolol I.V. injection 5 mg to 10 mg given over 5 minutes plus atenolol tablets 50 mg every 12 hours orally on the first study day (the first oral dose administered about 15 minutes after the I.V. dose) followed by either atenolol tablets 100 mg once daily or atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily on days 2 to 7. The groups were similar in demographic and medical history characteristics and in electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction, bundle branch block, and first degree atrioventricular block at entry. During the treatment period (days 0 to 7), the vascular mortality rates were 3.89 in the atenolol group (313 deaths) and 4.57 in the control group (365 deaths). This absolute difference in rates, 0.68, is statistically significant at the P  0.05 level. The absolute difference translates into a proportional reduction of 15 (3.89 to 4.57)4.57  0.15. The 95 confidence limits are 1 to 27. Most of the difference was attributed to mortality in days 0 to 1 (atenolol  121 deaths control  171 deaths). Despite the large size of the ISIS1 trial, it is not possible to identify clearly subgroups of patients most likely or least likely to benefit from early treatment with atenolol. Good clinical judgment suggests, however, that patients who are dependent on sympathetic stimulation for maintenance of adequate cardiac output and blood pressure are not good candidates for beta blockade. Indeed, the trial protocol reflected that judgment by excluding patients with blood pressure consistently below 100 mm Hg systolic. The overall results of the study are compatible with the possibility that patients with borderline blood pressure (less than 120 mm Hg systolic), especially if over 60 years of age, are less likely to benefit. The mechanism through which atenolol improves survival in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction is unknown, as is the case for other beta blockers in the postinfarction setting. Atenolol, in addition to its effects on survival, has shown other clinical benefits including reduced frequency of ventricular premature beats, reduced chest pain, and reduced enzyme elevation.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS Impaired Renal Function Nadolol should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Information for Patients Patients, especially those with evidence of coronary artery insufficiency, should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of nadolol therapy without the physicians advice. Although cardiac failure rarely occurs in properly selected patients, patients being treated with betaadrenergic blocking agents should be advised to consult the physician at the first sign or symptom of impending failure. The patient should also be advised of a proper course in the event of an inadvertently missed dose. Drug Interactions When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with betaadrenergic receptor blocking agents Anesthetics, General Exaggeration of the hypotension induced by general anesthetics (see WARNINGS, Major Surgery). Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin) Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia adjust dosage of antidiabetic drug accordingly (see WARNINGS, <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> and Hypoglycemia). Catecholaminedepleting Drugs (e.g., reserpine) Additive effect monitor closely for evidence of hypotension andor excessive bradycardia (e.g., vertigo, syncope, postural hypotension). Digitalis Glycosides Both digitalis glycosides and betablockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Response to Treatment for Anaphylactic Reaction While taking betablockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In chronic oral toxicologic studies (one to two years) in mice, rats, and dogs, nadolol did not produce any significant toxic effects. In two year oral carcinogenic studies in rats and mice, nadolol did not produce any neoplastic, preneoplastic, or nonneoplastic pathologic lesions. In fertility and general reproductive performance studies in rats, nadolol caused no adverse effects. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C In animal reproduction studies with nadolol, evidence of embryo and fetotoxicity was found in rabbits, but not in rats or hamsters, at doses 5 to 10 times greater (on a mgkg basis) than the maximum indicated human dose. No teratogenic potential was observed in any of these species. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Nadolol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Neonates whose mothers are receiving nadolol at parturition have exhibited bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and associated symptoms. Nursing Mothers Nadolol is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy taking into account the importance of nadolol to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE Angina Pectoris Nadolol Tablets USP are indicated for the longterm management of patients with angina pectoris. Hypertension Nadolol Tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Nadolol Tablets USP. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programs Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Nadolol Tablets USP may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazidetype diuretics.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by betablockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although betablockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, they can be used with caution in patients with a history of failure who are wellcompensated, usually with digitalis and diuretics. Betaadrenergic blocking agents do not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle. IN PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF HEART FAILURE, continued use of betablockers can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Therefore, at the first sign or symptom of heart failure, the patient should be digitalized andor treated with diuretics, and the response observed closely, or nadolol should be discontinued (gradually, if possible). Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from betablocker therapy exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered nadolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, nadolol administration should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physicians advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue nadolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension. Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETABLOCKERS. Nadolol should be administered with caution since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous or exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2 receptors. Major Surgery Chronically administered betablocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> and Hypoglycemia Betaadrenergic blockade may prevent the appearance of premonitory signs and symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and blood pressure changes) of acute hypoglycemia. This is especially important with labile diabetics. Betablockade also reduces the release of insulin in response to hyperglycemia therefore, it may be necessary to adjust the dose of antidiabetic drugs. Thyrotoxicosis Betaadrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of betaadrenergic blockade which might precipitate a thyroid storm.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Nadolol is a nonselective betaadrenergic receptor blocking agent. Clinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated betablocking activity by showing (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and on exercise, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenolinduced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia. Nadolol specifically competes with betaadrenergic receptor agonists for available betareceptor sites it inhibits both the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle and the beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature, inhibiting the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to betaadrenergic stimulation proportionately. Nadolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and, unlike some other betaadrenergic blocking agents, nadolol has little direct myocardial depressant activity and does not have an anestheticlike membranestabilizing action. Animal and human studies show that nadolol slows the sinus rate and depresses AV conduction. In dogs, only minimal amounts of nadolol were detected in the brain relative to amounts in blood and other organs and tissues. Nadolol has low lipophilicity as determined by octanolwater partition coefficient, a characteristic of certain betablocking agents that has been correlated with the limited extent to which these agents cross the bloodbrain barrier, their low concentration in the brain, and low incidence of CNSrelated side effects. In controlled clinical studies, nadolol at doses of 40 to 320 mgday has been shown to decrease both standing and supine blood pressure, the effect persisting for approximately 24 hours after dosing. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of betaadrenergic receptor blocking agents has not been established however, factors that may be involved include (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (nonCNS) adrenergic neuron sites (especially cardiac) leading to decreased cardiac output, (2) a central effect leading to reduced tonicsympathetic nerve outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin secretion by blockade of the betaadrenergic receptors responsible for renin release from the kidneys. While cardiac output and arterial pressure are reduced by nadolol therapy, renal hemodynamics are stable, with preservation of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. By blocking catecholamineinduced increases in heart rate, velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and blood pressure, nadolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, making it useful for many patients in the longterm management of angina pectoris. On the other hand, nadolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure, particularly in patients with heart failure. Although betaadrenergic receptor blockade is useful in treatment of angina and hypertension, there are also situations in which sympathetic stimulation is vital. For example, in patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular function may depend on sympathetic drive. Betaadrenergic blockade may worsen AV block by preventing the necessary facilitating effects of sympathetic activity on conduction. Beta2adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic bronchodilator activity in patients subject to bronchospasm and may also interfere with exogenous bronchodilators in such patients. Absorption of nadolol after oral dosing is variable, averaging about 30 percent. Peak serum concentrations of nadolol usually occur in three to four hours after oral administration and the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract does not affect the rate or extent of nadolol absorption. Approximately 30 percent of the nadolol present in serum is reversibly bound to plasma protein. Unlike many other betaadrenergic blocking agents, nadolol is not metabolized by the liver and is excreted unchanged, principally by the kidneys. The halflife of therapeutic doses of nadolol is about 20 to 24 hours, permitting oncedaily dosage. Because nadolol is excreted predominantly in the urine, its halflife increases in renal failure (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Steadystate serum concentrations of nadolol are attained in six to nine days with oncedaily dosage in persons with normal renal function. Because of variable absorption and different individual responsiveness, the proper dosage must be determined by titration. Exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias have been reported after abrupt discontinuation of therapy with betaadrenergic blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease. Abrupt withdrawal of these agents in patients without coronary artery disease has resulted in transient symptoms, including tremulousness, sweating, palpitation, headache, and malaise. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, among them increased sensitivity to catecholamines because of increased numbers of beta receptors.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from betablocker therapy exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered nadolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, nadolol administration should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physicians advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue nadolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Nadolol can be removed from the general circulation by hemodialysis. In addition to gastric lavage, the following measures should be employed, as appropriate. In determining the duration of corrective therapy, note must be taken of the long duration of the effect of nadolol. Excessive Bradycardia Administer atropine (0.25 to 1 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously. Cardiac Failure Administer a digitalis glycoside and diuretic. It has been reported that glucagon may also be useful in this situation. Hypotension Administer vasopressors, e.g., epinephrine or levarterenol. (There is evidence that epinephrine may be the drug of choice.) Bronchospasm Administer a beta2stimulating agent andor a theophylline derivative.</td></tr>

This product contains 3 cream prefilled applicators that cure most vaginal yeast infections, plus an external cream that can be used for relief of itching and irritation on the skin outside the vagina (vulva) due to a yeast infection. Do not use this product if this is the first time you have vaginal discharge, itching, burning and discomfort. See your doctor or health professional first to find out the cause of your symptoms. If a doctor has told you in the past that you had a vaginal yeast infection and you have the same symptoms now (such as vaginal discharge, itching or burning), then this product may work for you. What is a vaginal yeast infection? A vaginal yeast infection is a common condition caused by an overgrowth of yeast (Candida) that may normally live in the vagina. Your doctor may call this infection monilia or candidiasis. Some women may have a yeast infection on the skin outside of the vagina (vulva) at the same time that they have a vaginal infection. Who can get a vaginal yeast infection? You can get a vaginal yeast infection at any age. It is most common during the childbearing years. Women who are pregnant or diabetic, taking antibiotics, birth control pills or steroids, or who have a weakened immune system are more likely to get repeated yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. Some medical conditions can weaken the bodys normal ability to fight infection. One of the most serious of these conditions is infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV  the virus that causes AIDS). The HIV virus causes the body to be more likely to get infections, including vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. If you may have been exposed to HIV and get repeated vaginal yeast infections, you should see your doctor right away. For more information on HIV infection, please contact your doctor or the CDC National AIDS HOTLINE. The CDC phone numbers are 1800342AIDS (English), 18003447432 (Spanish), or 18002437889 (hearing impaired, TDD). How can I tell if I have a vaginal yeast infection? When you have a vaginal yeast infection, you may have one or more of the following symptoms vaginal itching vaginal discharge that may be thick, white, and lumpy like cottage cheese vaginal soreness, irritation, or burning rash or redness on the skin outside the vagina (vulva) burning on urination painful vaginal intercourse (sex) Note Vaginal yeast infections do NOT cause fever, chills, lower abdominal, back or shoulder pain, foulsmelling vaginal discharge, or a missed period. These may be signs of a sexually transmitted disease( STD) or a tubal pregnancy. If you have these symptoms, call your doctor right away. What are other causes of a vaginal discharge? It is normal to have a small amount of vaginal discharge at certain times of the month. This normal discharge may be clear or slightly white and does not cause itching, pain or a foul odor. The most common cause of an abnormal vaginal discharge is an infection. These infections include bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (Trich), gonorrhea (GC) andor chlamydia. All of these may be transmitted sexually and are called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If you have more questions about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) call the CDC STD Hotline at 18002278922. Although many of the infections mentioned above can cause symptoms similar to a vaginal yeast infection (vaginal discharge, irritation and itching), their diagnosis must be made by a doctor so that proper treatment can be given. If these infections are not properly treated or if proper treatment is delayed, serious problems, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may result, which may prevent you from having children in the future. If you are pregnant and do not get the proper treatment, the infection may be passed to your baby before or during delivery and may cause your baby to have permanent damage. If you have multiple sex partners or a new sex partner, you should also ask a doctor before use to make sure you do not have an STD. Why do women get repeated vaginal yeast infections? Women may get repeated vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. Listed below are some of the causes of repeated yeast infections  hormonal changes occurring a few days before the monthly period  use of antibiotics  use of some birth control pills  pregnancy  <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> (sugar or high blood sugar)  clothing  wearing tight layers or moist clothing in the genital area  weakened immune system  some drugs (such as chemotherapy or steroids) and medical conditions can weaken the bodys normal ability to fight infection. One of the most serious of these conditions is infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV  the virus that causes AIDS). Infection with HIV causes the person to be more likely to get infections, including vaginal yeast infections. If you get vaginal yeast infections often (such as once a month or 3 in 6 months), you should talk to a doctor. Are vaginal yeast infections sexually transmitted? Vaginal yeast infections are usually not spread by having intercourse (sex). However, if your partner has a rash, itching or discomfort in his genital area, he should contact a doctor to find out the cause of his symptoms and tell the doctor that you are treating your vaginal yeast infection with this product. How can I prevent repeated vaginal yeast infections? To lower your chances of getting another yeast infection  Try to keep the genital area cool and dry. Yeast grow well in warm, moist areas. The following suggestions may be helpful (1) Wear cotton underwear and loosefitting clothes. (2) Change out of damp clothes or a wet bathing suit as soon as possible. (3) If you use minipads when you are not having a menstrual period, change the minipads often.  Talk with your doctor about any drugs you are now taking.

Dry the genital area thoroughly after a shower, bath or swim. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp clothes as soon as possible. A dry area is less likely to lead to the overgrowth of yeast. Wear cotton underwear and loosefitting clothes. Wipe from front to back after a bowel movement or after urination. Do not douche, because douching may wash the drug out of the vagina.

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>PREGNANCY Teratogenic Effects When rats were administered bupropion at oral doses of up to 300 mgkgday (approximately 7 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation, there were no apparent adverse effects on offspring development. One study has been conducted in pregnant women. This retrospective, managedcare database study assessed the risk of congenital malformations overall, and cardiovascular malformations specifically, following exposure to bupropion in the first trimester compared to the risk of these malformations following exposure to other antidepressants in the first trimester and bupropion outside of the first trimester. This study included 7,005 infants with antidepressant exposure during pregnancy, 1,213 of whom were exposed to bupropion in the first trimester. The study showed no greater risk for congenital malformations overall, or cardiovascular malformations specifically, following first trimester bupropion exposure compared to exposure to all other antidepressants in the first trimester, or bupropion outside of the first trimester. The results of this study have not been corroborated. Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS General Agitation and Insomnia Increased restlessness, agitation, anxiety, and insomnia, especially shortly after initiation of treatment, have been associated with treatment with bupropion. In 3 placebocontrolled clinical trials of seasonal affective disorder with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL), the incidence of agitation, anxiety, and insomnia are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

Symptoms in these studies were sufficiently severe to require discontinuation of treatment in 1 and 2.6 of patients treated with 300 and 400 mgday, respectively, of bupropion sustainedrelease tablets and 0.8 of patients treated with placebo. Psychosis, Confusion, and Other Neuropsychiatric Phenomena Depressed patients treated with bupropion have been reported to show a variety of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, concentration disturbance, paranoia, and confusion. In some cases, these symptoms abated upon dose reduction andor withdrawal of treatment. Activation of Psychosis andor Mania Antidepressants can precipitate manic episodes in bipolar disorder patients during the depressed phase of their illness and may activate latent psychosis in other susceptible patients. Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are expected to pose similar risks. Altered Appetite and Weight In 3 placebocontrolled clinical trials of seasonal affective disorder with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL), the percentage of patients with weight gain or weight loss are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Incidence of Weight Gain and Weight Loss in PlaceboControlled Trials of Bupropion Hydrochloride ExtendedRelease Tablets (XL) for Seasonal Affective Disorder Bupropion HydrochlorideExtendedReleaseTablets (XL)150 to 300 mgdayPlaceboWeight Change(n  537)(n  511)Gained 5 lbs1121Lost 5 lbs2311In placebocontrolled studies of major depressive disorder using WELLBUTRIN SRthe sustainedrelease formulation of bupropion, patients experienced weight gain or weight loss as shown in Table 5.

If weight loss is a major presenting sign of a patients depressive illness, the anorectic andor weightreducing potential of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be considered. Allergic Reactions Anaphylactoidanaphylactic reactions characterized by symptoms such as pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and dyspnea requiring medical treatment have been reported in clinical trials with bupropion. In addition, there have been rare spontaneous postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and anaphylactic shock associated with bupropion. A patient should stop taking bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) and consult a doctor if experiencing allergic or anaphylactoidanaphylactic reactions (e.g., skin rash, pruritus, hives, chest pain, edema, and shortness of breath) during treatment. Arthralgia, myalgia, and fever with rash and other symptoms suggestive of delayed hypersensitivity have been reported in association with bupropion. These symptoms may resemble serum sickness. Cardiovascular Effects In clinical practice, hypertension, in some cases severe, requiring acute treatment, has been reported in patients receiving bupropion alone and in combination with nicotine replacement therapy. These events have been observed in both patients with and without evidence of preexisting hypertension. Data from a comparative study of the sustainedrelease formulation of bupropion (ZYBANSustainedRelease Tablets), nicotine transdermal system (NTS), the combination of sustainedrelease bupropion plus NTS, and placebo as an aid to smoking cessation suggest a higher incidence of treatmentemergent hypertension in patients treated with the combination of sustainedrelease bupropion and NTS. In this study, 6.1 of patients treated with the combination of sustainedrelease bupropion and NTS had treatmentemergent hypertension compared to 2.5, 1.6, and 3.1 of patients treated with sustainedrelease bupropion, NTS, and placebo, respectively. The majority of these patients had evidence of preexisting hypertension. Three patients (1.2) treated with the combination of ZYBANand NTS and 1 patient (0.4) treated with NTS had study medication discontinued due to hypertension compared to none of the patients treated with ZYBANor placebo. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended in patients who receive the combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement. There is no clinical experience establishing the safety of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Therefore, care should be exercised if it is used in these groups. Bupropion was well tolerated in depressed patients who had previously developed orthostatic hypotension while receiving tricyclic antidepressants, and was also generally well tolerated in a group of 36 depressed inpatients with stable congestive heart failure (CHF). However, bupropion was associated with a rise in supine blood pressure in the study of patients with CHF, resulting in discontinuation of treatment in 2 patients for exacerbation of baseline hypertension. Hepatic Impairment Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be used with extreme caution in patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis. In these patients, a reduced frequency andor dose is required. Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment (including mildtomoderate hepatic cirrhosis) and reduced frequency andor dose should be considered in patients with mildtomoderate hepatic cirrhosis. All patients with hepatic impairment should be closely monitored for possible adverse effects that could indicate high drug and metabolite levels (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,WARNINGS, andDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Renal Impairment There is limited information on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion in patients with renal impairment. An interstudy comparison between normal subjects and patients with endstage renal failure demonstrated that the parent drug Cmax and AUC values were comparable in the 2 groups, whereas the hydroxybupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites had a 2.3 and 2.8fold increase, respectively, in AUC for patients with endstage renal failure. A second study, comparing normal subjects and patients with moderatetosevere renal impairment (GFR 30.910.8 mLmin) showed that exposure to a single 150 mg dose of sustainedrelease bupropion was approximately 2fold higher in patients with impaired renal function while levels of the hydroxybupropion and threoerythrohydrobupropion (combined) metabolites were similar in the 2 groups. Bupropion is extensively metabolized in the liver to active metabolites, which are further metabolized and subsequently excreted by the kidneys. Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment and a reduced frequency andor dose should be considered as bupropion and the metabolites of bupropion may accumulate in such patients to a greater extent than usual. The patient should be closely monitored for possible adverse effects that could indicate high drug or metabolite levels."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DRUG INTERACTIONS Few systemic data have been collected on the metabolism of bupropion following concomitant administration with other drugs or, alternatively, the effect of concomitant administration of bupropion on the metabolism of other drugs. Because bupropion is extensively metabolized, the coadministration of other drugs may affect its clinical activity. In vitro studies indicate that bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. Therefore, the potential exists for a drug interaction between bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) and drugs that are substrates of inhibitorsinducers of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme (e.g., orphenadrine, thiotepa, cyclophosphamide, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel). In addition, in vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, and fluvoxamine as well as nelfinavir, ritonavir and efavirenz inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion. No clinical studies have been performed to evaluate this finding. The threohydrobupropion metabolite of bupropion does not appear to be produced by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The effects of concomitant administration of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers. Following oral administration of two 150mg tablets of the sustainedrelease formulation of bupropion with and without 800 mg of cimetidine, the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were unaffected. However, there were 16 and 32 increases in the AUC and Cmax, respectively, of the combined moieties of threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion. In a series of studies in healthy volunteers, ritonavir (100 mg twice daily or 600 mg twice daily) or ritonavir 100 mg plus lopinavir 400 mg (KALETRA) twice daily reduced the exposure of bupropion and its major metabolites in a dose dependent manner by approximately 20 to 80. This effect is thought to be due to the induction of bupropion metabolism. Patients receiving ritonavir may need increased doses of bupropion, but the maximum recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Metabolism). While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of bupropion (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin). Multiple oral doses of bupropion had no statistically significant effects on the single dose pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine in 12 healthy volunteers. Animal data indicated that bupropion may be an inducer of drugmetabolizing enzymes in humans. In one study, following chronic administration of bupropion, 100 mg 3 times daily to 8 healthy male volunteers for 14 days, there was no evidence of induction of its own metabolism. Nevertheless, there may be the potential for clinically important alterations of blood levels of coadministered drugs. Drugs Metabolized By Cytochrome P450IID6 (CYP2D6)Many drugs, including most antidepressants (SSRIs, many tricyclics), betablockers, antiarrhythmics, and antipsychotics are metabolized by the CYP2D6 isoenzyme. Although bupropion is not metabolized by this isoenzyme, bupropion and hydroxybupropion are inhibitors of CYP2D6 isoenzyme in vitro. In a study of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of bupropion given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg desipramine increased the Cmax, AUC, and t12 of desipramine by an average of approximately 2, 5, and 2fold, respectively. The effect was present for at least 7 days after the last dose of bupropion. Concomitant use of bupropion with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 has not been formally studied. Therefore, coadministration of bupropion with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), betablockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication. If bupropion is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index. Although citalopram is not primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, in one study bupropion increased the Cmax and AUC of citalopram by 30 and 40, respectively. Citalopram did not affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its three metabolites. MAO InhibitorsStudies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAO inhibitor phenelzine (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS). Levodopa and AmantadineLimited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse experiences in patients receiving bupropion concurrently with either levodopa or amantadine. Administration of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) to patients receiving either levodopa or amantadine concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and gradual dose increases. Drugs That Lower Seizure ThresholdConcurrent administration of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution (seeWARNINGS). Low initial dosing and gradual dose increases should be employed. Nicotine Transdermal System(seePRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular Effects). AlcoholIn postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking alcohol during treatment with bupropion. The consumption of alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be minimized or avoided (also seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>"INDICATIONS  USAGE Major Depressive DisorderBupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The efficacy of bupropion in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in two 4week controlled trials of inpatients and in one 6week controlled trial of outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the Major Depression category of the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) (seeCLINICAL TRIALS). A major depressive episode (DSMIV) implies the presence of 1) depressed mood or 2) loss of interest or pleasure in addition, at least 5 of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2week period and represent a change from previous functioning depressed mood, markedly diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities, significant change in weight andor appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt, or suicidal ideation. The efficacy of bupropion in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in a placebocontrolled trial with the sustainedrelease formulation of bupropion (seeCLINICAL TRIALS). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Seasonal Affective DisorderBupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are indicated for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes in patients with a diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder. The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes was established in 3 controlled trials of adult outpatients with a history of major depressive disorder with an autumnwinter seasonal pattern as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSMIV) criteria (seeCLINICAL TRIALS). Seasonal affective disorder is characterized by recurrent major depressive episodes, most commonly occurring during the autumn andor winter months. Episodes may last up to 6 months in duration, typically beginning in the autumn and remitting in the springtime. Although patients with seasonal affective disorder may have depressive episodes during other times of the year, the diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder requires that the number of seasonal episodes substantially outnumber the number of nonseasonal episodes during the individuals lifetime."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (seeBOX WARNINGandWARNINGS Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk in Treating Psychiatric Disorders). Anyone considering the use of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder. Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are contraindicated in patients treated with ZYBAN Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are contraindicated in patients with a current or prior diagnosis of bulimia or anorexia nervosa because of a higher incidence of seizures noted in patients treated for bulimia with the immediaterelease formulation of bupropion. Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are contraindicated in patients undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol or sedatives (including benzodiazepines). The concurrent administration of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) and a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAO inhibitor and initiation of treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL). Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are contraindicated in patients who have shown an allergic response to bupropion or the other ingredients that make up bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION General Dosing ConsiderationsIt is particularly important to administer bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) in a manner most likely to minimize the risk of seizure (seeWARNINGS). Gradual escalation in dosage is also important if agitation, motor restlessness, and insomnia, often seen during the initial days of treatment, are to be minimized. If necessary, these effects may be managed by temporary reduction of dose or the shortterm administration of an intermediate to longacting sedative hypnotic. A sedative hypnotic usually is not required beyond the first week of treatment. Insomnia may also be minimized by avoiding bedtime doses. If distressing, untoward effects supervene, dose escalation should be stopped. Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed. Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) may be taken without regard to meals. Major Depressive DisorderInitial TreatmentThe usual adult target dose for bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) is 300 mgday, given once daily in the morning. Dosing with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should begin at 150 mgday given as a single daily dose in the morning. If the 150mg initial dose is adequately tolerated, an increase to the 300mgday target dose, given as once daily, may be made as early as day 4 of dosing, as this may lead to an increased risk of adverse effects including seizures. There should be an interval of at least 24 hours between successive doses. Increasing the Dosage Above 300 mgdayAs with other antidepressants, the full antidepressant effect of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) may not be evident until 4 weeks of treatment or longer. An increase in dosage to the maximum of 450 mgday, given as a single dose, may be considered for patients in whom no clinical improvement is noted after several weeks of treatment at 300 mgday. Maintenance TreatmentIt is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode. It is unknown whether or not the dose of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment. Seasonal Affective DisorderFor the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes associated with seasonal affective disorder, bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should generally be initiated in the autumn prior to the onset of depressive symptoms. Treatment should continue through the winter season and should be tapered and discontinued in early spring. The timing of initiation and duration of treatment should be individualized based on the patients historical pattern of seasonal major depressive episodes. Patients whose seasonal depressive episodes are infrequent or not associated with significant impairment should not generally be treated prophylactically. Dosing with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should begin at 150 mgday given as a single daily dose in the morning. If the 150mg initial dose is adequately tolerated, the dose of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be increased to the 300mgday dose after 1 week. If the 300mg dose is not adequately tolerated, the dose can be reduced to 150 mgday. The usual adult target dose for bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) is 300 mgday, given once daily in the morning. For patients taking 300 mgday during the autumnwinter season, the dose should be tapered to 150 mgday for 2 weeks prior to discontinuation. Doses of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) above 300 mgday have not been studied for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes. Switching Patients from WELLBUTRINTablets or from WELLBUTRIN SRSustainedRelease TabletsWhen switching patients from WELLBUTRINTablets to bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) or from WELLBUTRIN SRSustainedRelease Tablets to bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL), give the same total daily dose when possible. Patients who are currently being treated with WELLBUTRINTablets at 300 mgday (for example, 100 mg 3 times a day) may be switched to bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) 300 mg once daily. Patients who are currently being treated with WELLBUTRIN SRSustainedRelease Tablets at 300 mgday (for example, 150 mg twice daily) may be switched to bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) 300 mg once daily. Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Impaired Hepatic FunctionBupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be used with extreme caution in patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis. The dose should not exceed 150 mg every other day in these patients. bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment (including mildtomoderate hepatic cirrhosis) and a reduced frequency andor dose should be considered in patients with mildtomoderate hepatic cirrhosis (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,WARNINGS, andPRECAUTIONS). Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Impaired Renal FunctionBupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment and a reduced frequency andor dose should be considered (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYandPRECAUTIONS)."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance ClassBupropion is not a controlled substance. HumansControlled clinical studies of bupropion (immediaterelease formulation) conducted in normal volunteers, in subjects with a history of multiple drug abuse, and in depressed patients showed some increase in motor activity and agitationexcitement. In a population of individuals experienced with drugs of abuse, a single dose of 400 mg of bupropion produced mild amphetaminelike activity as compared to placebo on the MorphineBenzedrine Subscale of the Addiction Research Center Inventories (ARCI), and a score intermediate between placebo and amphetamine on the Liking Scale of the ARCI. These scales measure general feelings of euphoria and drug desirability. Findings in clinical trials, however, are not known to reliably predict the abuse potential of drugs. Nonetheless, evidence from singledose studies does suggest that the recommended daily dosage of bupropion when administered in divided doses is not likely to be especially reinforcing to amphetamine or stimulant abusers. However, higher doses that could not be tested because of the risk of seizure might be modestly attractive to those who abuse stimulant drugs. AnimalsStudies in rodents and primates have shown that bupropion exhibits some pharmacologic actions common to psychostimulants. In rodents, it has been shown to increase locomotor activity, elicit a mild stereotyped behavioral response, and increase rates of responding in several schedulecontrolled behavior paradigms. In primate models to assess the positive reinforcing effects of psychoactive drugs, bupropion was selfadministered intravenously. In rats, bupropion produced amphetaminelike and cocainelike discriminative stimulus effects in drug discrimination paradigms used to characterize the subjective effects of psychoactive drugs.</td></tr>

The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL). Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk in Treating Psychiatric Disorders Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a daytoday basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Suicide Risk in Smoking Cessation Treatment Although bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are not indicated for smoking cessation treatment, it contains the same active ingredient as ZYBANwhich is approved for this use. Patients should be informed that quitting smoking, with or without ZYBANmay be associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms (including depression or agitation), or exacerbation of preexisting psychiatric illness. Furthermore some patients have experienced changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide when attempting to quit smoking while taking ZYBANIf patients develop agitation, hostility, depressed mood, or changes in thinking or behavior that are not typical for them, or if patients develop suicidal ideation or behavior, they should be urged to report these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. BupropionContaining ProductsPatients should be made aware that bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) contains the same active ingredient found in ZYBANused as an aid to smoking cessation treatment, and that bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should not be used in combination with ZYBANor any other medications that contain bupropion hydrochloride (such as WELLBUTRIN SRthe sustainedrelease formulation, and WELLBUTRINthe immediaterelease formulation). Patients should be told that bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be discontinued and not restarted if they experience a seizure while on treatment. Patients should be told that any CNSactive drug like bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) may impair their ability to perform tasks requiring judgment or motor and cognitive skills. Consequently, until they are reasonably certain that bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) does not adversely affect their performance, they should refrain from driving an automobile or operating complex, hazardous machinery. Patients should be told that the excessive use or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol or sedatives (including benzodiazepines) may alter the seizure threshold. Some patients have reported lower alcohol tolerance during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL). Patients should be advised that the consumption of alcohol should be minimized or avoided. Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking or plan to take any prescription or overthecounter drugs. Concern is warranted because bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) and other drugs may affect each others metabolism. Patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy. Patients should be advised to swallow bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) whole so that the release rate is not altered. Do not chew, divide, or crush tablets, as this may lead to an increased risk of adverse effects, including seizures. Patients should be advised that they may notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet. This is normal. The medication in bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) is contained in a nonabsorbable shell that has been specially designed to slowly release drug in the body. When this process is completed, the empty shell is eliminated from the body."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>"WARNINGS Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk in Treating Psychiatric Disorders The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 shortterm trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 shortterm trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drugplacebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. Table 1 Age RangeDrugPlacebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1,000 Patients TreatedIncreases Compared to Placebo1814 additional cases18245 additional casesDecreases Compared to Placebo25641 fewer case6 fewer casesNo suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longerterm use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebocontrolled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression andor the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.Prescriptions for bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Suicide Risk in Smoking Cessation Treatment WELLBUTRINWELLBUTRIN SRand bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are not approved for smoking cessation treatment, but bupropion under the name ZYBANis approved for this use. Serious neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients taking bupropion for smoking cessation (seeBOXED WARNING,ADVERSE REACTIONS).These have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, hostility, agitation, aggression, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide. Some reported cases may have been complicated by the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal in patients who stopped smoking. Depressed mood may be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal. Depression, rarely including suicidal ideation, has been reported in smokers undergoing a smoking cessation attempt without medication. However, some of these symptoms have occurred in patients taking bupropion who continued to smoke. When symptoms were reported, most were during bupropion treatment, but some were following discontinuation of bupropion therapy. These events have occurred in patients with and without preexisting psychiatric disease some have experienced worsening of their psychiatric illnesses. All patients being treated with bupropion as part of smoking cessation treatment should be observed for neuropsychiatric symptoms or worsening of preexisting psychiatric illness. Patients with serious psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder did not participate in the premarketing studies of ZYBAN Advise patients and caregivers that the patient using bupropion for smoking cessation should contact a healthcare provider immediately if agitation, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient are observed, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. In many postmarketing cases, resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of ZYBANwas reported, although in some cases the symptoms persisted, therefore, ongoing monitoring and supportive care should be provided until symptoms resolve. The risks of using bupropion for smoking cessation should be weighed against the benefits of its use. ZYBANhas been demonstrated to increase the likelihood of abstinence from smoking for as long as six months compared to treatment with placebo. The health benefits of quitting smoking are immediate and substantial. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixedmanic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. BupropionContaining Products Patients should be made aware that bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) contain the same active ingredient found in ZYBANused as an aid to smoking cessation treatment, and that bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should not be used in combination with ZYBANor any other medications that contain bupropion, such as WELLBUTRIN SR(bupropion hydrochloride), the sustainedrelease formulation or WELLBUTRIN(bupropion hydrochloride), the immediaterelease formulation. Seizures Bupropion is associated with a doserelated risk of seizures. The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications, which must be considered in selection of patients for therapy with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL). Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets USP (XL) should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure while on treatment. As bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) bioequivalent to both the immediaterelease formulation of bupropion and to the sustainedrelease formulation of bupropion, the seizure incidence with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL), while not formally evaluated in clinical trials, may be similar to that presented below for the immediaterelease and sustainedrelease formulations of bupropion.  Dose At doses up to 300 mgday of the sustainedrelease formulation of bupropion (WELLBUTRIN SRthe incidence of seizure is approximately 0.1 (11,000). Data for the immediaterelease formulation of bupropion revealed a seizure incidence of approximately 0.4 (i.e., 13 of 3,200 patients followed prospectively) in patients treated at doses in a range of 300 to 450 mgday. This seizure incidence (0.4) may exceed that of some other marketed antidepressants. Additional data accumulated for the immediaterelease formulation of bupropion suggested that the estimated seizure incidence increases almost tenfold between 450 and 600 mgday. The 600 mg dose is twice the usual adult dose and one and onethird the maximum recommended daily dose (450 mg) of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL). This disproportionate increase in seizure incidence with dose incrementation calls for caution in dosing.  Patient factors Predisposing factors that may increase the risk of seizure with bupropion use include history of head trauma or prior seizure, central nervous system (CNS) tumor, the presence of severe hepatic cirrhosis, and concomitant medications that lower seizure threshold.  Clinical situations Circumstances associated with an increased seizure risk include, among others, excessive use of alcohol or sedatives (including benzodiazepines) addiction to opiates, cocaine, or stimulants use of overthecounter stimulants and anorectics and <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> treated with oral hypoglycemics or insulin.  Concomitant medications Many medications (e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids) are known to lower seizure threshold. Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Seizure Retrospective analysis of clinical experience gained during the development of bupropion suggests that the risk of seizure may be minimized if  the total daily dose of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) does not exceed 450 mg,  the rate of incrementation of dose is gradual. Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be administered with extreme caution to patients with a history of seizure, cranial trauma, or other predisposition(s) toward seizure, or patients treated with other agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold. Hepatic Impairment Bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) should be used with extreme caution in patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis. In these patients a reduced frequency andor dose is required as peak bupropion as well as AUC, levels are substantially increased and accumulation is likely to occur in such patients to a greater extent than usual. The dose should not exceed 150 mg every other day in these patients (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,PRECAUTIONS, andDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Potential for Hepatotoxicity In rats receiving large doses of bupropion chronically, there was an increase in incidence of hepatic hyperplastic nodules and hepatocellular hypertrophy. In dogs receiving large doses of bupropion chronically, various histologic changes were seen in the liver, and laboratory tests suggesting mild hepatocellular injury were noted."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>GERIATRIC USE Of the approximately 6,000 patients who participated in clinical trials with bupropion sustainedrelease tablets (depression and smoking cessation studies), 275 wereyears old and 47 wereyears old. In addition, several hundred patients 65 and over participated in clinical trials using the immediaterelease formulation of bupropion (depression studies). No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. A singledose pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the disposition of bupropion and its metabolites in elderly subjects was similar to that of younger subjects however, another pharmacokinetic study, single and multiple dose, has suggested that the elderly are at increased risk for accumulation of bupropion and its metabolites (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Bupropion is extensively metabolized in the liver to active metabolites, which are further metabolized and excreted by the kidneys. The risk of toxic reaction to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (seePRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment andDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and does not inhibit monoamine oxidase or the reuptake of serotonin. While the mechanism of action of bupropion, as with other antidepressants, is unknown, it is presumed that this action is mediated by noradrenergic andor dopaminergic mechanisms. Pharmacokinetics Bupropion is a racemic mixture. The pharmacologic activity and pharmacokinetics of the individual enantiomers have not been studied. The mean elimination halflife (of bupropion after chronic dosing is 21 (hours, and steadystate plasma concentrations of bupropion are reached within 8 days. In a study comparing 14day dosing with a bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablet (XL) 300 mg once daily to the immediaterelease formulation of bupropion at 100 mg 3 times daily, equivalence was demonstrated for peak plasma concentration and area under the curve for bupropion and the 3 metabolites (hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion). Additionally, in a study comparing 14day dosing with a bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablet (XL) 300 mg once daily to the sustainedrelease formulation of bupropion at 150 mg 2 times daily, equivalence was demonstrated for peak plasma concentration and area under the curve for bupropion and the 3 metabolites. AbsorptionFollowing oral administration of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) to healthy volunteers, time to peak plasma concentrations for bupropion was approximately 5 hours and food did not affect the Cmax or AUC of bupropion. Distribution In vitro tests show that bupropion is 84 bound to human plasma proteins at concentrations up to 200 mcgmL. The extent of protein binding of the hydroxybupropion metabolite is similar to that for bupropion, whereas the extent of protein binding of the threohydrobupropion metabolite is about half that seen with bupropion. MetabolismBupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. Three metabolites have been shown to be active hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the tertbutyl group of bupropion, and the aminoalcohol isomers threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via reduction of the carbonyl group. In vitro findings suggest that cytochrome P450IIB6 (CYP2B6) is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion. Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of metachlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been fully characterized. However, it has been demonstrated in an antidepressant screening test in mice that hydroxybupropion is one half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion are 5fold less potent than bupropion. This may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high or higher than those of bupropion. Because bupropion is extensively metabolized, there is the potential for drugdrug interactions, particularly with those agents that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIB6 (CYP2B6) or which inhibit induce the cytochrome P450IIB6 (CYP2B6) isoenzyme, such as ritonavir. In a healthy volunteer study, ritonavir at a dose of 100 mg twice daily reduced the AUC and Cmax of bupropion by 22 and 21, respectively. The exposure of the hydroxybupropion metabolite was decreased by 23, the threohydrobupropion decreased by 38 and the erythrohydrobupropion decreased by 48. In a second healthy volunteer study, ritonavir at a dose of 600 mg twice daily decreased the AUC and the Cmax of bupropion by 66 and 62, respectively. The exposure of the hydroxybupropion metabolite was decreased by 78, the threohydrobupropion decreased by 50 and the erythrohydrobupropion decreased by 68. In another healthy volunteer study, KALETRA (lopinavir 400 mgritonavir 100 mg twice daily) decreased bupropion AUC and Cmax by 57. The AUC and Cmax of hydroxybupropion were decreased by 50 and 31, respectively, (seePRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions). Although bupropion is not metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6 (CYP2D6), there is the potential for drugdrug interactions when bupropion is coadministered with drugs metabolized by this isoenzyme (seePRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions). In humans, peak plasma concentrations of hydroxybupropion occur approximately 7 hours after administration of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL). Following administration of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL), peak plasma concentrations of hydroxybupropion are approximately 7 times the peak level of the parent drug at steady state. The elimination halflife of hydroxybupropion is approximately 20 (hours, and its AUC at steady state is about 13 times that of bupropion. The times to peak concentrations for the erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites are similar to that of the hydroxybupropion metabolite. However, their elimination halflives are longer, approximately 33 (and 37 (hours, respectively, and steadystate AUCs are 1.4 and 7 times that of bupropion, respectively. Bupropion and its metabolites exhibit linear kinetics following chronic administration of 300 to 450 mgday. EliminationFollowing oral administration of 200 mg of 14Cbupropion in humans, 87 and 10 of the radioactive dose were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. However, the fraction of the oral dose of bupropion excreted unchanged was only 0.5, a finding consistent with the extensive metabolism of bupropion. Population SubgroupsFactors or conditions altering metabolic capacity (e.g., liver disease, congestive heart failure CHF, age, concomitant medications, etc.) or elimination may be expected to influence the degree and extent of accumulation of the active metabolites of bupropion. The elimination of the major metabolites of bupropion may be affected by reduced renal or hepatic function because they are moderately polar compounds and are likely to undergo further metabolism or conjugation in the liver prior to urinary excretion. HepaticThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion was characterized in 2 singledose studies, one in patients with alcoholic liver disease and one in patients with mild to severe cirrhosis. The first study showed that the halflife of hydroxybupropion was significantly longer in 8 patients with alcoholic liver disease than in 8 healthy volunteers (32hours versus 21hours, respectively). Although not statistically significant, the AUCs for bupropion and hydroxybupropion were more variable and tended to be greater (by 53 to 57) in patients with alcoholic liver disease. The differences in halflife for bupropion and the other metabolites in the 2 patient groups were minimal. The second study showed no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites in 9 patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis compared to 8 healthy volunteers. However, more variability was observed in some of the pharmacokinetic parameters for bupropion (AUC, Cmax, and Tmax) and its active metabolites (tfor hydroxybupropion and about 2for threoerythrohydrobupropion. The median Tmax was observed 19 hours later for hydroxybupropion and 31 hours later for threoerythrohydrobupropion. The mean halflives for hydroxybupropion and threoerythrohydrobupropion were increased 5 and 2fold, respectively, in patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy volunteers (seeWARNINGS,PRECAUTIONS, andDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). RenalThere is limited information on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion in patients with renal impairment. An interstudy comparison between normal subjects and patients with endstage renal failure demonstrated that the parent drug Cmax and AUC values were comparable in the 2 groups, whereas the hydroxybupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites had a 2.3 and 2.8fold increase, respectively, in AUC for patients with endstage renal failure. A second study, comparing normal subjects and patients with moderatetosevere renal impairment (GFR 30.910.8 mLmin) showed that exposure to a single 150 mg dose sustainedrelease bupropion was approximately 2fold higher in patients with impaired renal function while levels of the hydroxybupropion and threoerythrohydrobupropion (combined) metabolites were similar in the 2 groups. The elimination of bupropion andor the major metabolites of bupropion may be reduced by impaired renal function (seePRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment). Left Ventricular DysfunctionDuring a chronic dosing study with bupropion in 14 depressed patients with left ventricular dysfunction (history of CHF or an enlarged heart on xray), no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion or its metabolites was revealed, compared to healthy volunteers. Age PRECAUTIONS Geriatric Use). GenderA singledose study involving 12 healthy male and 12 healthy female volunteers revealed no sexrelated differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of bupropion. Smokers CLINICAL TRIALS Major Depressive Disorder In a longerterm study, outpatients meeting DSMIV criteria for major depressive disorder, recurrent type, who had responded during an 8week open trial on bupropion (150 mg twice daily of the sustainedrelease formulation) were randomized to continuation of their same dose of bupropion or placebo, for up to 44 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as CGI Improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) for each of the final 3 weeks. Relapse during the doubleblind phase was defined as the investigators judgment that drug treatment was needed for worsening depressive symptoms. Patients receiving continued bupropion treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 44 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. Although there are no independent trials demonstrating the antidepressant effectiveness of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) , studies have demonstrated similar bioavailability of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) to both the immediaterelease formulation and to the sustainedrelease formulation of bupropion under steadystate conditions, i.e., bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) 300 mg once daily was shown to have bioavailability that was similar to that of 100 mg 3 times daily of the immediaterelease formulation of bupropion and to that of 150 mg 2 times daily of the sustainedrelease formulation of bupropion, with regard to both peak plasma concentration and extent of absorption, for parent drug and metabolites. Seasonal Affective DisorderThe efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes associated with seasonal affective disorder was established in 3 doubleblind, placebocontrolled trials in adult outpatients with a history of major depressive disorder with an autumnwinter seasonal pattern (as defined by DSMIV criteria). Treatment was initiated prior to the onset of symptoms in the autumn (September to November) and was discontinued following a 2 week taper that began the first week of spring (fourth week of March), resulting in a treatment duration of approximately 4 to 6 months for the majority of patients. At the start of the study, patients were randomized to receive placebo or bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) 150 mg once daily for 1 week, followed by uptitration to 300 mg once daily. Patients who were deemed by the investigator to be unlikely or unable to tolerate 300 mg once daily were allowed to remain on, or had their dose reduced to, 150 mg once daily. The mean doses of bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) in the 3 studies ranged from 257 to 280 mgday. In these 3 trials, the percentage of patients who were depressionfree at the end of treatment was significantly higher for bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL) than for placebo 81.4 vs 69.7, 87.2 vs 78.7, and 84.0 vs 69.0 for Study 1, 2 and 3, respectively with a depressionfree rate for the 3 studies combined of 84.3 vs 72.0."</td></tr>

Fever, muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported mainly when bupropion was part of multiple drug overdoses. Although most patients recovered without sequelae, deaths associated with overdoses of bupropion alone have been reported in patients ingesting large doses of the drug. Multiple uncontrolled seizures, bradycardia, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest prior to death were reported in these patients. Overdosage ManagementEnsure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. EEG monitoring is also recommended for the first 48 hours postingestion. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Activated charcoal should be administered. There is no experience with the use of forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, or exchange transfusion in the management of bupropion overdoses. No specific antidotes for bupropion are known. Due to the doserelated risk of seizures with bupropion hydrochloride extendedrelease tablets (XL), hospitalization following suspected overdose should be considered. Based on studies in animals, it is recommended that seizures be treated with intravenous benzodiazepine administration and other supportive measures, as appropriate. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the PhysiciansDesk Reference (PDR)."</td></tr>

(7.7) 7.1 In Vitro Data In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin. 7.2 Cimetidine Coadministration of amlodipine with cimetidine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine. 7.3 Grapefruit Juice Coadministration of 240 mL of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of amlodipine 10 mg in 20 healthy volunteers had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine. 7.4 Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxide Antacid Coadministration of a magnesium and aluminum hydroxide antacid with a single dose of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine. 7.5 Sildenafil A single 100 mg dose of sildenafil in subjects with essential hypertension had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine. When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect. 7.6 Atorvastatin Coadministration of multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine with 80 mg of atorvastatin resulted in no significant change in the steadystate pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin. 7.7 Simvastatin Coadministration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77 increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on amlodipine to 20 mg daily. 7.8 Digoxin Coadministration of amlodipine with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance in normal volunteers. 7.9 Ethanol (Alcohol) Single and multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ethanol. 7.10 Warfarin Coadministration of amlodipine with warfarin did not change the warfarin prothrombin response time. 7.11 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60 increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin coadministration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 7.12 CYP3A4 Inducers No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be closely monitored when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inducers. 7.13 Cyclosporine A prospective study in renal transplant patients (N11) showed on an average of 40 increase in trough cyclosporine levels when concomitantly treated with amlodipine. 7.14 DrugLaboratory Test Interactions None known.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amlodipine besylate tablets USP are calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of Hypertension (1.1)  Amlodipine besylate tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Coronary Artery Disease (1.2)  Chronic Stable Angina  Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetals or Variant Angina)  Angiographically Documented Coronary Artery Disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction  40 1.1 Hypertension Amlodipine besylate tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine besylate. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programs Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine besylate tablets USP may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine besylate tablets USP are indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets USP may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetals or Variant Angina) Amlodipine besylate tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets USP may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction 40, amlodipine besylate tablets USP are indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure."</td></tr>

Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was welltolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N1250), discontinuation of amlodipine because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5 of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are reflected in table below. The incidence () of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows Amlodipine Placebo 2 . 5 mg N  275 5 mg N  296 10 mg N  268 N  520 Edema 1.8 3.0 10.8 0.6 Dizziness 1.1 3.4 3.4 1.5 Flushing 0.7 1.4 2.6 0.0 Palpitation 0.7 1.4 4.5 0.6 Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported with an incidence greater than 1.0 in placebocontrolled clinical trials include the following PlaceboControlled Studies Amlodipine () ( N  1730 ) Placebo () ( N  1250 ) Fatigue 4.5 2.8 Nausea 2.9 1.9 Abdominal Pain 1.6 0.3 Somnolence 1.4 0.6 For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table Amlodipine Placebo Male  ( N  1218 ) Female  ( N  512 ) Male  ( N  914 ) Female  ( N  336 ) Edema 5.6 14.6 1.4 5.1 Flushing 1.5 4.5 0.3 0.9 Palpitations 1.4 3.3 0.9 0.9 Somnolence 1.3 1.6 0.8 0.3 The following events occurred in 1 but 0.1 of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship Cardiovascular arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis.

Hemopoietic leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. 1These events occurred in less than 1 in placebocontrolled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1 and 2 in all multiple dose studies. Amlodipine therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. In the CAMELOT and PREVENT studies see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4) , the adverse event profile was similar to that reported previously (see above), with the most common adverse event being peripheral edema. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Amlodipine has been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, wellcompensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.</td></tr>

(2.2) Important Limitation Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients. (2.2) 2.1 Adults The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine besylate tablet USP is 5 mg once daily and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine besylate tablet USP to other antihypertensive therapy. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titrate more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently. Angina The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect. Coronary Artery Disease The recommended dose range for patients with coronary artery disease is 5 to 10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4) . 2.2 Children The effective antihypertensive oral dose in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.4), CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>"12.1 Mechanism of Action Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slowchannel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following Exertional Angina In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise. Vasospastic Angina Amlodipine has been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro. This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine in vasospastic (Prinzmetals or variant) angina."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of amlodipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40 to 60, and a lower initial dose may be required see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1) .</td></tr>

The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following Exertional Angina In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise. Vasospastic Angina Amlodipine has been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro. This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine in vasospastic (Prinzmetals or variant) angina. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina. With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50 greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (12 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dPdt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with betablockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or wellcompensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects. Electrophysiologic Effects Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter AH and HV conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine and concomitant betablockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with betablockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90. The bioavailability of amlodipine is not altered by the presence of food. Amlodipine is extensively (about 90) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10 of the parent compound and 60 of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93 of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination halflife of about 30 to 50 hours. Steadystate plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose. Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. 12.4 Pediatric Patients Sixtytwo hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weightadjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Effects in Hypertension Adult Patients The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 doubleblind, placebocontrolled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebocorrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 126 mmHg in the standing position and 137 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was doserelated within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients. Pediatric Patients Two hundred sixtyeight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults. 14.2 Effects in Chronic Stable Angina The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mgday of amlodipine in exerciseinduced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptomlimited exercise time averaged 12.8 (63 sec) for amlodipine 10 mg, and averaged 7.9 (38 sec) for amlodipine 5 mg. Amlodipine 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine in angina patients has been demonstrated over longterm dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (41 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (0.3 bpm). 14.3 Effects in Vasospastic Angina In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1week (p0.01). Two of 23 amlodipine and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement. 14.4 Effects in Documented Coronary Artery Disease In PREVENT, 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease were randomized to amlodipine (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo and followed for 3 years. Although the study did not show significance on the primary objective of change in coronary luminal diameter as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, the data suggested a favorable outcome with respect to fewer hospitalizations for angina and revascularization procedures in patients with CAD. CAMELOT enrolled 1318 patients with CAD recently documented by angiography, without left main coronary disease and without heart failure or an ejection fraction 40. Patients (76 males, 89 Caucasian, 93 enrolled at U.S. sites, 89 with a history of angina, 52 without PCI, 4 with PCI and no stent, and 44 with a stent) were randomized to doubleblind treatment with either amlodipine (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standard care that included aspirin (89), statins (83), betablockers (74), nitroglycerin (50), anticoagulants (40), and diuretics (32), but excluded other calcium channel blockers. The mean duration of followup was 19 months. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of one of the following events hospitalization for angina pectoris, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospitalization for heart failure, strokeTIA, or peripheral vascular disease. A total of 110 (16.6) and 151 (23.1) first events occurred in the amlodipine and placebo groups, respectively, for a hazard ratio of 0.691 (95 CI 0.540 to 0.884, p  0.003). The primary endpoint is summarized in Figure 1 below. The outcome of this study was largely derived from the prevention of hospitalizations for angina and the prevention of revascularization procedures (see Table 1). Effects in various subgroups are shown in Figure 2. In an angiographic substudy (n274) conducted within CAMELOT, there was no significant difference between amlodipine and placebo on the change of atheroma volume in the coronary artery as assessed by intravascular ultrasound. Figure 1  KaplanMeier Analysis of Composite Clinical Outcomes for Amlodipine versus Placebo Figure 2  Effects on Primary Endpoint of Amlodipine versus Placebo across SubGroups Table 1 below summarizes the significant composite endpoint and clinical outcomes from the composites of the primary endpoint. The other components of the primary endpoint including cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, strokeTIA, or peripheral vascular disease did not demonstrate a significant difference between amlodipine and placebo.

In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or left ventricular ejection fraction. In a longterm (followup at least 6 months, mean 13.8 months) placebo controlled mortalitymorbidity study of amlodipine 5 to 10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA Classes III (n931) or IV (n222) heart failure on stable doses of diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors, amlodipine had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of allcause mortality and cardiac morbidity (as defined by lifethreatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure), or on NYHA classification, or symptoms of heart failure. Total combined allcause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222571 (39) for patients on amlodipine and 246583 (42) for patients on placebo the cardiac morbid events represented about 25 of the endpoints in the study. Another study (PRAISE2) randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80) or IV (20) heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors (99), digitalis (99), and diuretics (99), to placebo (n827) or amlodipine (n827) and followed them for a mean of 33 months. There was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine and placebo in the primary endpoint of allcause mortality (95 confidence limits from 8 reduction to 29 increase on amlodipine). With amlodipine there were more reports of pulmonary edema.

(8.1) Nursing Discontinue when administering amlodipine besylate tablets. (8.3) Pediatric Effect on patients less than 6 years old is not known. (8.4) Geriatric Start dosing at the low end of the dose range. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryofetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipinekgday (respectively, 8 times2 and 23 times2 the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mgm2 basis) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipinekgday for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. 2Based on patient weight of 50 kg. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while amlodipine is administered. 8.4 Pediatric Use Amlodipine besylate (2.5 to 5 mg daily) is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients 6 to 17 years see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1). Effect of Amlodipine besylate on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of amlodipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40 to 60, and a lower initial dose may be required see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly a reflex tachycardia. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited. Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipinekg and 100 mg amlodipinekg in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipinekg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina. With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50 greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (12 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dPdt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with betablockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or wellcompensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects. Electrophysiologic Effects Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter AH and HV conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine and concomitant betablockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with betablockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks.</td></tr>

Pyrazinamide has the following structural formula Each pyrazinamide tablet for oral administration contains 500 mg of pyrazinamide and the following inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate (dihydrate), microcrystalline cellulose, and stearic acid. MM1</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Pyrazinamide should always be administered with other effective antituberculous drugs. It is administered for the initial 2 months of a 6month or longer treatment regimen for drugsusceptible patients. Patients who are known or suspected to have drugresistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy. Patients with concomitant HIV infection may require longer courses of therapy. Physicians treating such patients should be alert to any revised recommendations from CDC for this group of patients. Usual dose Pyrazinamide is administered orally, 15 to 30 mgkg once daily. Older regimens employed 3 or 4 divided doses daily, but most current recommendations are for once a day. Three grams per day should not be exceeded. The CDC recommendations do not exceed 2 g per day when given as a daily regimen (see table). Alternatively, a twice weekly dosing regimen (50 to 75 mgkg twice weekly based on lean body weight) has been developed to promote patient compliance with a regimen on an outpatient basis. In studies evaluation the twice weekly regimen, doses of pyrazinamide in excess of 3 g twice weekly have been administered. This exceeds the recommended maximum 3 gdaily dose. However, an increased incidence of adverse reactions has not been reported. This table is taken from the CDCAmerican Thoracic Society joint recommendations.4 Recommended Drugs for the Initial Treatment of Tuberculosis in Children and Adults Daily Dose  Drug Children Adults Isoniazid 10 to 20 mgkgPO or IM 5 mgkgPO or IM Rifampin 10 to 20 mgkgPO 10 mgkgPO Pyrazinamide 15 to 30 mgkgPO 15 to 30 mgkgPO Streptomycin 20 to 40 mgkgIM 15 mgkg IM Ethambutol 15 to 25 mgkgPO 15 to 25 mgkgPO Doses based on weight should be adjusted as weight changes.

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pyrazinamide is well absorbed from the GI tract and attains peak plasma concentrations within 2 hours. Plasma concentrations generally range from 30 to 50 mcgmL with doses of 20 to 25 mgkg. It is widely distributed in body tissues and fluids including the liver, lungs and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF concentration is approximately equal to concurrent steadystate plasma concentrations in patients with inflamed meninges.1 Pyrazinamide is approximately 10 bound to plasma proteins.2 The halflife (t 12) of pyrazinamide is 9 to 10 hours in patients with normal renal and hepatic function. The plasma halflife may be prolonged in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Pyrazinamide is hydrolyzed in the liver to its major active metabolite, pyrazinoic acid. Pyrazinoic acid is hydroxylated to the main excretory product, 5hydroxypyrazinoic acid.3 Approximately 70 of an oral dose is excreted in the urine, mainly by glomerular filtration within 24 hours.3 Pyrazinamide may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal against Mycobacterium tuberculosis depending on the concentration of the drug attained at the site of infection. The mechanism of action is unknown. In vitro and in vivo the drug is active only at a slightly acidic pH.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS Pyrazinamide inhibits renal excretion of urates, frequently resulting in hyperuricemia which is usually asymptomatic. If hyperuricemia is accompanied by acute gouty arthritis, pyrazinamide should be discontinued. Pyrazinamide should be used with caution in patients with a history of <b style='color:red'>Diabetes</b> mellitus, as management may be more difficult. Primary resistance of M. tuberculosis to pyrazinamide is uncommon. In cases with known or suspected drug resistance, in vitro susceptibility tests with recent cultures of M. tuberculosis against pyrazinamide and the usual primary drugs should be performed. There are few reliable in vitro tests for pyrazinamide resistance. A reference laboratory capable of performing these studies must be employed. Patients should be instructed to notify their physicians promptly if they experience any of the following fever, loss of appetite, malaise, nausea and vomiting, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, pain or swelling of the joints. Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed. Baseline liver function studies especially ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT) determinations and uric acid levels should be determined prior to therapy. Appropriate laboratory testing should be performed at periodic intervals and if any clinical signs of symptoms occur during therapy. Pyrazinamide has been reported to interfere with ACETEST and KETOSTIX urine tests to produce a pinkbrown color.5 In lifetime bioassays in rats and mice, pyrazinamide was administered in the diet at concentrations of up to 10,000 ppm. This resulted in estimated daily doses for the mouse of 2 gkg, or 40 times the maximum human dose, and for the rat of 0.5 gkg, or 10 times the maximum human dose. Pyrazinamide was not carcinogenic in rats or male mice and no conclusion was possible for female mice due to insufficient numbers of surviving control mice. Pyrazinamide was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial test, but induced chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocyte cell cultures. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pyrazinamide. It is also not known whether pyrazinamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Pyrazinamide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Pyrazinamide has been found in small amounts in breast milk. Therefore, it is advised that pyrazinamide be used with caution in nursing mothers taking into account the riskbenefit of this therapy.9 Pyrazinamide regimens employed in adults are probably equally effective in pediatric patients.4,10,11 Pyrazinamide appears to be well tolerated in pediatric patients. Clinical studies of pyrazinamide did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or renal function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. It does not appear that patients with impaired renal function require a reduction in dose. It may be prudent to select doses at the low end of the dosing range, however.13</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS  USAGE Pyrazinamide is indicated for the initial treatment of active tuberculosis in adults and children when combined with other antituberculous agents. (The current recommendation of the CDC for drugsusceptible disease is to use a sixmonth regimen for initial treatment of active tuberculosis, consisting of isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide given for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months.4) (Patients with drugresistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy.) (In patients with concomitant HIV infection, the physician should be aware of current recommendation of CDC. It is possible these patients may require a longer course of treatment). It is also indicated after treatment failure with other primary drugs in any form of active tuberculosis. Pyrazinamide should only be used in conjunction with other effective antituberculous agents. See recommendations of Center for Disease Control (CDC) and American Thoracic Society for complete regimen and dosage recommendations.4</td></tr>
