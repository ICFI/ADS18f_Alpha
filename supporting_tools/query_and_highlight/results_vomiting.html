<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The following in vitro mutagenicity tests have been conducted with clarithromycin SalmonellaMammalian Microsomes Test Bacterial Induced Mutation Frequency Test In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test Rat Hepatocyte DNA Synthesis Assay Mouse Lymphoma Assay Mouse Dominant Lethal Study Mouse Micronucleus Test All tests had negative results except the In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test which was weakly positive in one test and negative in another. In addition, a Bacterial ReverseMutation Test (Ames Test) has been performed on clarithromycin metabolites with negative results. Fertility and reproduction studies have shown that daily doses of up to 160 mgkgday (1.3 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2) to male and female rats caused no adverse effects on the estrous cycle, fertility, parturition, or number and viability of offspring. Plasma levels in rats after 150 mgkgday were 2 times the human serum levels. In the 150 mgkgday monkey studies, plasma levels were 3 times the human serum levels. When given orally at 150 mgkgday (2.4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2), clarithromycin was shown to produce embryonic loss in monkeys. This effect has been attributed to marked maternal toxicity of the drug at this high dose. In rabbits, in utero fetal loss occurred at an intravenous dose of 33 mgm2, which is 17 times less than the maximum proposed human oral daily dose of 618 mgm2. Longterm studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of clarithromycin.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Four teratogenicity studies in rats (three with oral doses and one with intravenous doses up to 160 mgkgday administered during the period of major organogenesis) and two in rabbits at oral doses up to 125 mgkgday (approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2) or intravenous doses of 30 mgkgday administered during gestation days 6 to 18 failed to demonstrate any teratogenicity from clarithromycin. Two additional oral studies in a different rat strain at similar doses and similar conditions demonstrated a low incidence of cardiovascular anomalies at doses of 150 mgkgday administered during gestation days 6 to 15. Plasma levels after 150 mgkgday were 2 times the human serum levels. Four studies in mice revealed a variable incidence of cleft palate following oral doses of 1000 mgkgday (2 and 4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2, respectively) during gestation days 6 to 15. Cleft palate was also seen at 500 mgkgday. The 1000 mgkgday exposure resulted in plasma levels 17 times the human serum levels. In monkeys, an oral dose of 70 mgkgday (an approximate equidose of the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2) produced fetal growth retardation at plasma levels that were 2 times the human serum levels. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Clarithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing clarithromycin tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drugresistant bacteria. Clarithromycin is principally excreted via the liver and kidney. Clarithromycin may be administered without dosage adjustment to patients with hepatic impairment and normal renal function. However, in the presence of severe renal impairment with or without coexisting hepatic impairment, decreased dosage or prolonged dosing intervals may be appropriate. Clarithromycin in combination with ranitidine bismuth citrate therapy is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 25 mLmin. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Clarithromycin in combination with ranitidine bismuth citrate should not be used in patients with a history of acute porphyria. Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin therapy. For information about precautions of other drugs indicated in combination with clarithromycin, refer to the PRECAUTIONS section of their package inserts. Information to Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clarithromycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clarithromycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clarithromycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Clarithromycin tablets may interact with some drugs therefore patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other medications. Clarithromycin tablets can be taken with or without food and can be taken with milk. Drug Interactions Clarithromycin use in patients who are receiving theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline concentrations. Monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations should be considered for patients receiving high doses of theophylline or with baseline concentrations in the upper therapeutic range. In two studies in which theophylline was administered with clarithromycin (a theophylline sustainedrelease formulation was dosed at either 6.5 mgkg or 12 mgkg together with 250 or 500 mg q12h clarithromycin), the steadystate levels of Cmax, Cmin, and the area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) of theophylline increased about 20. Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil, belonging to the calcium channel blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of single doses of clarithromycin and carbamazepine has been shown to result in increased plasma concentrations of carbamazepine. Blood level monitoring of carbamazepine may be considered. When clarithromycin and terfenadine were coadministered, plasma concentrations of the active acid metabolite of terfenadine were threefold higher, on average, than the values observed when terfenadine was administered alone. The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin and the 14hydroxyclarithromycin were not significantly affected by coadministration of terfenadine once clarithromycin reached steadystate conditions. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with terfenadine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Clarithromycin 500 mg every 8 hours was given in combination with omeprazole 40 mg daily to healthy adult subjects. The steadystate plasma concentrations of omeprazole were increased (Cmax, AUC024, and T12 increases of 30, 89, and 34, respectively), by the concomitant administration of clarithromycin. The mean 24hour gastric pH value was 5.2 when omeprazole was administered alone and 5.7 when coadministered with clarithromycin. Coadministration of clarithromycin with ranitidine bismuth citrate resulted in increased plasma ranitidine concentrations (57), increased plasma bismuth trough concentrations (48), and increased 14hydroxyclarithromycin plasma concentrations (31). These effects are clinically insignificant. Simultaneous oral administration of clarithromycin tablets and zidovudine to HIVinfected adult patients may result in decreased steadystate zidovudine concentrations. Following administration of clarithromycin 500 mg tablets twice daily with zidovudine 100 mg every 4 hours, the steadystate zidovudine AUC decreased 12 compared to administration of zidovudine alone (n4). Individual values ranged from a decrease of 34 to an increase of 14. When clarithromycin tablets were administered two to four hours prior to zidovudine, the steadystate zidovudine Cmax increased 100 whereas the AUC was unaffected (n24). Administration of clarithromycin and zidovudine should be separated by at least two hours. The impact of coadministration of clarithromycin extendedrelease tablets and zidovudine has not been evaluated. Simultaneous administration of clarithromycin tablets and didanosine to 12 HIVinfected adult patients resulted in no statistically significant change in didanosine pharmacokinetics. Following administration of fluconazole 200 mg daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily to 21 healthy volunteers, the steadystate clarithromycin Cmin and AUC increased 33 and 18, respectively. Steadystate concentrations of 14OH clarithromycin were not significantly affected by concomitant administration of fluconazole. No dosage adjustment of clarithromycin is necessary when coadministered with fluconazole. Ritonavir Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and ritonavir (n22) resulted in a 77 increase in clarithromycin AUC and a 100 decrease in the AUC of 14OH clarithromycin. Clarithromycin may be administered without dosage adjustment to patients with normal renal function taking ritonavir. Since concentrations of 14OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is coadministered with ritonavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex (see PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions ). Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1000 mg per day should not be coadministered with protease inhibitors. Spontaneous reports in the postmarketing period suggest that concomitant administration of clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants may potentiate the effects of the oral anticoagulants. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants simultaneously. Digoxin is a substrate for Pglycoprotein (Pgp) and clarithromycin is known to inhibit Pgp. When clarithromycin and digoxin are coadministered, inhibition of Pgp by clarithromycin may lead to increased exposure of digoxin. Elevated digoxin serum concentrations in patients receiving clarithromycin and digoxin concomitantly have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Some patients have shown clinical signs consistent with digoxin toxicity, including potentially fatal arrhythmias. Monitoring of serum digoxin concentrations should be considered, especially for patients with digoxin concentrations in the upper therapeutic range. Coadministration of clarithromycin, known to inhibit CYP3A, and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug. Clarithromycin should be used with caution in patients receiving treatment with other drugs known to be CYP3A enzyme substrates, especially if the CYP3A substrate has a narrow safety margin (e.g., carbamazepine) andor the substrate is extensively metabolized by this enzyme. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving clarithromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform are also possible. Carbamazepine and Terfenadine Increased serum concentrations of carbamazepine and the active acid metabolite of terfenadine were observed in clinical trials with clarithromycin. Colchicine Colchicine is a substrate for both CYP3A and the efflux transporter, Pglycoprotein (Pgp). Clarithromycin and other macrolides are known to inhibit CYP3A and Pgp. When a single dose of colchicine 0.6 mg was administered with clarithromycin 250 mg BID for 7 days, the colchicine Cmax increased 197 and the AUC0 increased 239 compared to administration of colchicine alone. The dose of colchicine should be reduced when coadministered with clarithromycin in patients with normal renal and hepatic function. Concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. (See WARNINGS ). Efavirenz, Nevirapine, Rifampicin, Rifabutin, and Rifapentine Inducers of CYP3A enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampicin, rifabutin, and rifapentine will increase the metabolism of clarithromycin, thus decreasing plasma concentrations of clarithromycin, while increasing those of 14OHclarithromycin. Since the microbiological activities of clarithromycin and 14OHclarithromycin are different for different bacteria, the intended therapeutic effect could be impaired during concomitant administration of clarithromycin and enzyme inducers. Alternative antibacterial treatment should be considered when treating patients receiving inducers of CYP3A. Sildenafil, Tadalafil, and Vardenafil Each of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, and CYP3A will be inhibited by concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Coadministration of clarithromycin with sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil will result in increased exposure of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Coadministration of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors with clarithromycin is not recommended. Tolterodine The primary route of metabolism for tolterodine is via CYP2D6. However, in a subset of the population devoid of CYP2D6, the identified pathway of metabolism is via CYP3A. In this population subset, inhibition of CYP3A results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine. Tolterodine 1 mg twice daily is recommended in patients deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers) when coadministered with clarithromycin. Triazolobenzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam) When a single dose of midazolam was coadministered with clarithromycin tablets (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), midazolam AUC increased 174 after intravenous administration of midazolam and 600 after oral administration. When oral midazolam is coadministered with clarithromycin, dose adjustments may be necessary and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated. Caution and appropriate dose adjustments should be considered when triazolam or alprazolam is coadministered with clarithromycin. For benzodiazepines which are not metabolized by CYP3A (e.g., temazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam), a clinically important interaction with clarithromycin is unlikely. There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions and central nervous system (CNS) effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Monitoring the patient for increased CNS pharmacological effects is suggested. Atazanavir Both clarithromycin and atazanavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, and there is evidence of a bidirectional drug interaction. Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (400 mg once daily), the clarithromycin AUC increased 94, the 14OH clarithromycin AUC decreased 70 and the atazanavir AUC increased 28. When clarithromycin is coadministered with atazanavir, the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 50. Since concentrations of 14OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is coadministered with atazanavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex (see PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions ). Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1000 mg per day should not be coadministered with protease inhibitors. Itraconazole Both clarithromycin and itraconazole are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, potentially leading to a bidirectional drug interaction when administered concomitantly. Clarithromycin may increase the plasma concentrations of itraconazole, while itraconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of clarithromycin. Patients taking itraconazole and clarithromycin concomitantly should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged adverse reactions. Saquinavir Both clarithromycin and saquinavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A and there is evidence of a bidirectional drug interaction. Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg bid) and saquinavir (soft gelatin capsules, 1200 mg tid) to 12 healthy volunteers, the steadystate saquinavir AUC and Cmax increased 177 and 187 respectively compared to administration of saquinavir alone. Clarithromycin AUC and Cmax increased 45 and 39 respectively, whereas the 14OH clarithromycin AUC and Cmax decreased 24 and 34 respectively, compared to administration with clarithromycin alone. No dose adjustment of clarithromycin is necessary when clarithromycin is coadministered with saquinavir in patients with normal renal function. When saquinavir is coadministered with ritonavir, consideration should be given to the potential effects of ritonavir on clarithromycin (refer to interaction between clarithromycin and ritonavir) (see PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions ). The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products andor with clarithromycin in postmarketing experience Antiarrhythmics There have been postmarketing reports of torsades de pointes occurring with concurrent use of clarithromycin and quinidine or disopyramide. Electrocardiograms should be monitored for QTc prolongation during coadministration of clarithromycin with these drugs. Serum concentrations of these medications should also be monitored. ErgotamineDihydroergotamine Postmarketing reports indicate that coadministration of clarithromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as Triazolam and Alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines (such as Midazolam) Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions and CNS effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Sildenafil (Viagra) Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of sildenafil. A similar interaction may occur with clarithromycin reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert.) There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin andor clarithromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, bromocriptine and vinblastine. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin or clarithromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The following in vitro mutagenicity tests have been conducted with clarithromycin SalmonellaMammalian Microsomes Test Bacterial Induced Mutation Frequency Test In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test Rat Hepatocyte DNA Synthesis Assay Mouse Lymphoma Assay Mouse Dominant Lethal Study Mouse Micronucleus Test All tests had negative results except the In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test which was weakly positive in one test and negative in another. In addition, a Bacterial ReverseMutation Test (Ames Test) has been performed on clarithromycin metabolites with negative results. Fertility and reproduction studies have shown that daily doses of up to 160 mgkgday (1.3 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2) to male and female rats caused no adverse effects on the estrous cycle, fertility, parturition, or number and viability of offspring. Plasma levels in rats after 150 mgkgday were 2 times the human serum levels. In the 150 mgkgday monkey studies, plasma levels were 3 times the human serum levels. When given orally at 150 mgkgday (2.4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2), clarithromycin was shown to produce embryonic loss in monkeys. This effect has been attributed to marked maternal toxicity of the drug at this high dose. In rabbits, in utero fetal loss occurred at an intravenous dose of 33 mgm2, which is 17 times less than the maximum proposed human oral daily dose of 618 mgm2. Longterm studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of clarithromycin. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Four teratogenicity studies in rats (three with oral doses and one with intravenous doses up to 160 mgkgday administered during the period of major organogenesis) and two in rabbits at oral doses up to 125 mgkgday (approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2) or intravenous doses of 30 mgkgday administered during gestation days 6 to 18 failed to demonstrate any teratogenicity from clarithromycin. Two additional oral studies in a different rat strain at similar doses and similar conditions demonstrated a low incidence of cardiovascular anomalies at doses of 150 mgkgday administered during gestation days 6 to 15. Plasma levels after 150 mgkgday were 2 times the human serum levels. Four studies in mice revealed a variable incidence of cleft palate following oral doses of 1000 mgkgday (2 and 4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2, respectively) during gestation days 6 to 15. Cleft palate was also seen at 500 mgkgday. The 1000 mgkgday exposure resulted in plasma levels 17 times the human serum levels. In monkeys, an oral dose of 70 mgkgday (an approximate equidose of the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2) produced fetal growth retardation at plasma levels that were 2 times the human serum levels. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Clarithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. (See WARNINGS .) Nursing Mothers It is not known whether clarithromycin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when clarithromycin is administered to a nursing woman. It is known that clarithromycin is excreted in the milk of lactating animals and that other drugs of this class are excreted in human milk. Preweaned rats, exposed indirectly via consumption of milk from dams treated with 150 mgkgday for 3 weeks, were not adversely affected, despite data indicating higher drug levels in milk than in plasma. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in pediatric patients under 6 months of age have not been established. The safety of clarithromycin has not been studied in MAC patients under the age of 20 months. Neonatal and juvenile animals tolerated clarithromycin in a manner similar to adult animals. Young animals were slightly more intolerant to acute overdosage and to subtle reductions in erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes but were less sensitive to toxicity in the liver, kidney, thymus, and genitalia. Geriatric Use In a steadystate study in which healthy elderly subjects (age 65 to 81 years old) were given 500 mg every 12 hours, the maximum serum concentrations and area under the curves of clarithromycin and 14OH clarithromycin were increased compared to those achieved in healthy young adults. These changes in pharmacokinetics parallel known agerelated decreases in renal function. In clinical trials, elderly patients did not have an increased incidence of adverse events when compared to younger patients. Dosage adjustment should be considered in elderly patients with severe renal impairment. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .)</td></tr>

The mean 24hour gastric pH value was 5.2 when omeprazole was administered alone and 5.7 when coadministered with clarithromycin. Coadministration of clarithromycin with ranitidine bismuth citrate resulted in increased plasma ranitidine concentrations (57), increased plasma bismuth trough concentrations (48), and increased 14hydroxyclarithromycin plasma concentrations (31). These effects are clinically insignificant. Simultaneous oral administration of clarithromycin tablets and zidovudine to HIVinfected adult patients may result in decreased steadystate zidovudine concentrations. Following administration of clarithromycin 500 mg tablets twice daily with zidovudine 100 mg every 4 hours, the steadystate zidovudine AUC decreased 12 compared to administration of zidovudine alone (n4). Individual values ranged from a decrease of 34 to an increase of 14. When clarithromycin tablets were administered two to four hours prior to zidovudine, the steadystate zidovudine Cmax increased 100 whereas the AUC was unaffected (n24). Administration of clarithromycin and zidovudine should be separated by at least two hours. The impact of coadministration of clarithromycin extendedrelease tablets and zidovudine has not been evaluated. Simultaneous administration of clarithromycin tablets and didanosine to 12 HIVinfected adult patients resulted in no statistically significant change in didanosine pharmacokinetics. Following administration of fluconazole 200 mg daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily to 21 healthy volunteers, the steadystate clarithromycin Cmin and AUC increased 33 and 18, respectively.

Coadministration of clarithromycin, known to inhibit CYP3A, and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug. Clarithromycin should be used with caution in patients receiving treatment with other drugs known to be CYP3A enzyme substrates, especially if the CYP3A substrate has a narrow safety margin (e.g., carbamazepine) andor the substrate is extensively metabolized by this enzyme. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving clarithromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform are also possible. Carbamazepine and Terfenadine Increased serum concentrations of carbamazepine and the active acid metabolite of terfenadine were observed in clinical trials with clarithromycin. Colchicine Colchicine is a substrate for both CYP3A and the efflux transporter, Pglycoprotein (Pgp). Clarithromycin and other macrolides are known to inhibit CYP3A and Pgp. When a single dose of colchicine 0.6 mg was administered with clarithromycin 250 mg BID for 7 days, the colchicine Cmax increased 197 and the AUC0 increased 239 compared to administration of colchicine alone. The dose of colchicine should be reduced when coadministered with clarithromycin in patients with normal renal and hepatic function. Concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. (See WARNINGS ). Efavirenz, Nevirapine, Rifampicin, Rifabutin, and Rifapentine Inducers of CYP3A enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampicin, rifabutin, and rifapentine will increase the metabolism of clarithromycin, thus decreasing plasma concentrations of clarithromycin, while increasing those of 14OHclarithromycin. Since the microbiological activities of clarithromycin and 14OHclarithromycin are different for different bacteria, the intended therapeutic effect could be impaired during concomitant administration of clarithromycin and enzyme inducers. Alternative antibacterial treatment should be considered when treating patients receiving inducers of CYP3A. Sildenafil, Tadalafil, and Vardenafil Each of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, and CYP3A will be inhibited by concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Coadministration of clarithromycin with sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil will result in increased exposure of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Coadministration of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors with clarithromycin is not recommended. Tolterodine The primary route of metabolism for tolterodine is via CYP2D6. However, in a subset of the population devoid of CYP2D6, the identified pathway of metabolism is via CYP3A. In this population subset, inhibition of CYP3A results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine. Tolterodine 1 mg twice daily is recommended in patients deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers) when coadministered with clarithromycin. Triazolobenzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam) When a single dose of midazolam was coadministered with clarithromycin tablets (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), midazolam AUC increased 174 after intravenous administration of midazolam and 600 after oral administration. When oral midazolam is coadministered with clarithromycin, dose adjustments may be necessary and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated. Caution and appropriate dose adjustments should be considered when triazolam or alprazolam is coadministered with clarithromycin. For benzodiazepines which are not metabolized by CYP3A (e.g., temazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam), a clinically important interaction with clarithromycin is unlikely. There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions and central nervous system (CNS) effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Monitoring the patient for increased CNS pharmacological effects is suggested. Atazanavir Both clarithromycin and atazanavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, and there is evidence of a bidirectional drug interaction. Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (400 mg once daily), the clarithromycin AUC increased 94, the 14OH clarithromycin AUC decreased 70 and the atazanavir AUC increased 28. When clarithromycin is coadministered with atazanavir, the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 50. Since concentrations of 14OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is coadministered with atazanavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex (see PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions ). Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1000 mg per day should not be coadministered with protease inhibitors. Itraconazole Both clarithromycin and itraconazole are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, potentially leading to a bidirectional drug interaction when administered concomitantly. Clarithromycin may increase the plasma concentrations of itraconazole, while itraconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of clarithromycin. Patients taking itraconazole and clarithromycin concomitantly should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged adverse reactions. Saquinavir Both clarithromycin and saquinavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A and there is evidence of a bidirectional drug interaction. Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg bid) and saquinavir (soft gelatin capsules, 1200 mg tid) to 12 healthy volunteers, the steadystate saquinavir AUC and Cmax increased 177 and 187 respectively compared to administration of saquinavir alone. Clarithromycin AUC and Cmax increased 45 and 39 respectively, whereas the 14OH clarithromycin AUC and Cmax decreased 24 and 34 respectively, compared to administration with clarithromycin alone. No dose adjustment of clarithromycin is necessary when clarithromycin is coadministered with saquinavir in patients with normal renal function. When saquinavir is coadministered with ritonavir, consideration should be given to the potential effects of ritonavir on clarithromycin (refer to interaction between clarithromycin and ritonavir) (see PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions ). The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products andor with clarithromycin in postmarketing experience Antiarrhythmics There have been postmarketing reports of torsades de pointes occurring with concurrent use of clarithromycin and quinidine or disopyramide. Electrocardiograms should be monitored for QTc prolongation during coadministration of clarithromycin with these drugs. Serum concentrations of these medications should also be monitored. ErgotamineDihydroergotamine Postmarketing reports indicate that coadministration of clarithromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as Triazolam and Alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines (such as Midazolam) Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions and CNS effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Sildenafil (Viagra) Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of sildenafil. A similar interaction may occur with clarithromycin reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert.) There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin andor clarithromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, bromocriptine and vinblastine. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin or clarithromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated bacteria in the conditions as listed below Adults PharyngitisTonsillitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes (The usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections and the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever is penicillin administered by either the intramuscular or the oral route. Clarithromycin is generally effective in the eradication of S. pyogenes from the nasopharynx however, data establishing the efficacy of clarithromycin in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present.) Acute maxillary sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Haemophilus parainfluenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae CommunityAcquired Pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , or Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus , or Streptococcus pyogenes (Abscesses usually require surgical drainage.) Disseminated mycobacterial infections due to Mycobacterium avium , or Mycobacterium intracellulare Clarithromycin tablets in combination with amoxicillin and lansoprazole or omeprazole delayedrelease capsules, as triple therapy, are indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or fiveyear history of duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori. Clarithromycin tablets in combination with omeprazole capsules or ranitidine bismuth citrate tablets are also indicated for the treatment of patients with an active duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection. However, regimens which contain clarithromycin as the single antimicrobial agent are more likely to be associated with the development of clarithromycin resistance among patients who fail therapy. Clarithromycincontaining regimens should not be used in patients with known or suspected clarithromycin resistant isolates because the efficacy of treatment is reduced in this setting. In patients who fail therapy, susceptibility testing should be done if possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated, a nonclarithromycincontaining therapy is recommended. (For information on development of resistance see Microbiology section.) The eradication of H. pylori has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Children PharyngitisTonsillitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes CommunityAcquired Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , or Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) Acute maxillary sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae Acute otitis media due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis,or Streptococcus pneumoniae NOTE For information on otitis media, see CLINICAL STUDIES Otitis Media . Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus , or Streptococcus pyogenes (Abscesses usually require surgical drainage.) Disseminated mycobacterial infections due to Mycobacterium avium , or Mycobacterium intracellulare Prophylaxis Clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the prevention of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in patients with advanced HIV infection. To reduce the development of drugresistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clarithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, clarithromycin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in pediatric patients under 6 months of age have not been established. The safety of clarithromycin has not been studied in MAC patients under the age of 20 months. Neonatal and juvenile animals tolerated clarithromycin in a manner similar to adult animals. Young animals were slightly more intolerant to acute overdosage and to subtle reductions in erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes but were less sensitive to toxicity in the liver, kidney, thymus, and genitalia.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to clarithromycin or any of its excipients, erythromycin, or any of the macrolide antibiotics. Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundicehepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and any of the following drugs is contraindicated cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, and ergotamine or dihydroergotamine (see Drug Interactions ). There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when clarithromycin andor erythromycin are coadministered with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine resulting in cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes) most likely due to inhibition of metabolism of these drugs by erythromycin and clarithromycin. Fatalities have been reported. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Clarithromycin should not be given to patients with history of QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes. Clarithromycin should not be used concomitantly with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 (lovastatin or simvastatin), due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The majority of side effects observed in clinical trials were of a mild and transient nature. Fewer than 3 of adult patients without mycobacterial infections and fewer than 2 of pediatric patients without mycobacterial infections discontinued therapy because of drugrelated side effects. The most frequently reported events in adults taking clarithromycin tablets, USP were diarrhea (3), nausea (3), abnormal taste (3), dyspepsia (2), abdominal paindiscomfort (2), and headache (2). In pediatric patients, the most frequently reported events were diarrhea (6), <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b> (6), abdominal pain (3), rash (3), and headache (2). Most of these events were described as mild or moderate in severity. Of the reported adverse events, only 1 was described as severe. In the acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute maxillary sinusitis studies overall gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by a similar proportion of patients taking either clarithromycin tablets or clarithromycin extendedrelease tablets however, patients taking clarithromycin extendedrelease tablets reported significantly less severe gastrointestinal symptoms compared to patients taking clarithromycin tablets. In addition, patients taking clarithromycin extendedrelease tablets had significantly fewer premature discontinuations for drugrelated gastrointestinal or abnormal taste adverse events compared to clarithromycin tablets. In communityacquired pneumonia studies conducted in adults comparing clarithromycin to erythromycin base or erythromycin stearate, there were fewer adverse events involving the digestive system in clarithromycintreated patients compared to erythromycintreated patients (13 vs 32 p0.01). Twenty percent of erythromycintreated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events compared to 4 of clarithromycintreated patients. In two U.S. studies of acute otitis media comparing clarithromycin to amoxicillinpotassium clavulanate in pediatric patients, there were fewer adverse events involving the digestive system in clarithromycintreated patients compared to amoxicillinpotassium clavulanatetreated patients (21 vs 40, p0.001). Onethird as many clarithromycintreated patients reported diarrhea as did amoxicillinpotassium clavulanatetreated patients. PostMarketing Experience Allergic reactions ranging from urticaria and mild skin eruptions to rare cases of anaphylaxis, StevensJohnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), HenochSchonlein Purpura and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Other spontaneously reported adverse events include glossitis, stomatitis, oral moniliasis, anorexia, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, pancreatitis, tongue discoloration, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, dizziness, myalgia and hemorrhage. There have been reports of tooth discoloration in patients treated with clarithromycin. Tooth discoloration is usually reversible with professional dental cleaning. There have been isolated reports of hearing loss, which is usually reversible, occurring chiefly in elderly women. Reports of alterations of the sense of smell including smell loss, usually in conjunction with taste perversion or taste loss, have also been reported. Transient CNS events including anxiety, behavioral changes, confusional states, convulsions, depersonalization, disorientation, hallucinations, insomnia, depression, manic behavior, nightmares, psychosis, tinnitus, tremor, and vertigo have been reported during postmarketing surveillance. Events usually resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Adverse reactions related to hepatic dysfunction have been reported in postmarketing experience with clarithromycin. (See WARNINGS Hepatotoxicity .) There have been rare reports of hypoglycemia, some of which have occurred in patients taking oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. There have been postmarketing reports of clarithromycin tablets in the stool, many of which have occurred in patients with anatomic (including ileostomy or colostomy) or functional gastrointestinal disorders with shortened GI transit times. As with other macrolides, clarithromycin has been associated with QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes. There have been reports of interstitial nephritis coincident with clarithromycin use. There have been postmarketing reports of colchicine toxicity with concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine, especially in the elderly, some of which occurred in patients with renal insufficiency. Deaths have been reported in some such patients. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .) There have been cases of rhabdomyolysis reported with clarithromycin use. In some cases, clarithromycin was administered concomitantly with other drugs known to be associated with rhabdomyolysis (such as statins, fibrates, colchicine or allopurinol). Changes in Laboratory Values Changes in laboratory values with possible clinical significance were as follows Hepatic  elevated SGPT (ALT) 1 SGOT (AST) 1 GGT 1 alkaline phosphatase 1 LDH 1 total bilirubin 1 Hematologic  decreased WBC 1 elevated prothrombin time 1 Renal  elevated BUN 4 elevated serum creatinine 1 GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time data are from adult studies only.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>Information to Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clarithromycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clarithromycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clarithromycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Clarithromycin tablets may interact with some drugs therefore patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other medications. Clarithromycin tablets can be taken with or without food and can be taken with milk.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>General Prescribing clarithromycin tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drugresistant bacteria. Clarithromycin is principally excreted via the liver and kidney. Clarithromycin may be administered without dosage adjustment to patients with hepatic impairment and normal renal function. However, in the presence of severe renal impairment with or without coexisting hepatic impairment, decreased dosage or prolonged dosing intervals may be appropriate. Clarithromycin in combination with ranitidine bismuth citrate therapy is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 25 mLmin. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Clarithromycin in combination with ranitidine bismuth citrate should not be used in patients with a history of acute porphyria. Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin therapy. For information about precautions of other drugs indicated in combination with clarithromycin, refer to the PRECAUTIONS section of their package inserts.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>DESCRIPTION Clarithromycin is a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic. Chemically, it is 60methylerythromycin. The molecular formula is C38H69NO13, and the molecular weight is 747.96. The structural formula is Clarithromycin is a white to offwhite crystalline powder. It is soluble in acetone, slightly soluble in methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile, and practically insoluble in water. Each clarithromycin tablet intended for oral administration contains 250 mg or 500 mg of clarithromycin. In addition, each clarithromycin tablet contains the following inactive ingredients croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, povidone, talc, and titanium dioxide.

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Use In Pregnancy CLARITHROMYCIN SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PREGNANT WOMEN EXCEPT IN CLINICAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE NO ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IS APPROPRIATE. IF PREGNANCY OCCURS WHILE TAKING THIS DRUG, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. CLARITHROMYCIN HAS DEMONSTRATED ADVERSE EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY OUTCOME ANDOR EMBRYOFETAL DEVELOPMENT IN MONKEYS, RATS, MICE, AND RABBITS AT DOSES THAT PRODUCED PLASMA LEVELS 2 TO 17 TIMES THE SERUM LEVELS ACHIEVED IN HUMANS TREATED AT THE MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED HUMAN DOSES. (See PRECAUTIONS Pregnancy .) Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular andor cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been reported with clarithromycin. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In some instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases andor concomitant medications. Discontinue clarithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur. QT Prolongation Clarithromycin has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving clarithromycin. Fatalities have been reported. Clarithromycin should be avoided in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drugassociated effects on the QT interval. Drug Interactions Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin and hypotension with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem) (see PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions ). Lifethreatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with clarithromycin and colchicine. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If coadministration of clarithromycin and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the dose of colchicine should be reduced. Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions ). Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. For information about warnings of other drugs indicated in combination with clarithromycin, refer to the WARNINGS section of their package inserts. Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions In the event of severe acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, StevensJohnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and HenochSchonlein purpura clarithromycin therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment should be urgently initiated. Oral Hypoglycemic AgentsInsulin The concomitant use of clarithromycin and oral hypoglycemic agents andor insulin can result in significant hypoglycemia. With certain hypoglycemic drugs such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide and rosiglitazone, inhibition of CYP3A enzyme by clarithromycin may be involved and could cause hypolgycemia when used concomitantly. Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended. Oral Anticoagulants There is a risk of serious hemorrhage and significant elevations in INR and prothrombin time when clarithromycin is coadministered with warfarin. INR and prothrombin times should be frequently monitored while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants concurrently. HMGCoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins) Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) as these statins are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin increases their plasma concentration, which increases the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with these statins. If treatment with clarithromycin cannot be avoided, therapy with lovastatin or simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment. Caution should be exercised when prescribing clarithromycin with statins. In situations where the concomitant use of clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin cannot be avoided, atorvastatin dose should not exceed 20 mg daily and pravastatin dose should not exceed 40 mg daily. Use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g.fluvastatin) can be considered. It is recommended to prescribe the lowest registered dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Geriatric Use In a steadystate study in which healthy elderly subjects (age 65 to 81 years old) were given 500 mg every 12 hours, the maximum serum concentrations and area under the curves of clarithromycin and 14OH clarithromycin were increased compared to those achieved in healthy young adults. These changes in pharmacokinetics parallel known agerelated decreases in renal function. In clinical trials, elderly patients did not have an increased incidence of adverse events when compared to younger patients. Dosage adjustment should be considered in elderly patients with severe renal impairment. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Clarithromycin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of 250 mg clarithromycin tablets was approximately 50. For a single 500 mg dose of clarithromycin, food slightly delays the onset of clarithromycin absorption, increasing the peak time from approximately 2 to 2.5 hours. Food also increases the clarithromycin peak plasma concentration by about 24, but does not affect the extent of clarithromycin bioavailability. Food does not affect the onset of formation of the antimicrobially active metabolite, 14OH clarithromycin or its peak plasma concentration but does slightly decrease the extent of metabolite formation, indicated by an 11 decrease in area under the plasma concentrationtime curve (AUC). Therefore, clarithromycin tablets may be given without regard to food. In nonfasting healthy human subjects (males and females), peak plasma concentrations were attained within 2 to 3 hours after oral dosing. Steadystate peak plasma clarithromycin concentrations were attained within 3 days and were approximately 1 to 2 mcgmL with a 250 mg dose administered every 12 hours and 3 to 4 mcgmL with a 500 mg dose administered every 8 to 12 hours. The elimination halflife of clarithromycin was about 3 to 4 hours with 250 mg administered every 12 hours but increased to 5 to 7 hours with 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 hours. The nonlinearity of clarithromycin pharmacokinetics is slight at the recommended doses of 250 mg and 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 hours. With a 250 mg every 12 hours dosing, the principal metabolite, 14OH clarithromycin, attains a peak steadystate concentration of about 0.6 mcgmL and has an elimination halflife of 5 to 6 hours. With a 500 mg every 8 to 12 hours dosing, the peak steadystate concentration of 14OH clarithromycin is slightly higher (up to 1 mcgmL), and its elimination halflife is about 7 to 9 hours. With any of these dosing regimens, the steadystate concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 3 to 4 days. After a 250 mg tablet every 12 hours, approximately 20 of the dose is excreted in the urine as clarithromycin, while after a 500 mg tablet every 12 hours, the urinary excretion of clarithromycin is somewhat greater, approximately 30. In comparison, after an oral dose of 250 mg (125 mg5 mL) suspension every 12 hours, approximately 40 is excreted in urine as clarithromycin. The renal clearance of clarithromycin is, however, relatively independent of the dose size and approximates the normal glomerular filtration rate. The major metabolite found in urine is 14OH clarithromycin, which accounts for an additional 10 to 15 of the dose with either a 250 mg or a 500 mg tablet administered every 12 hours. Steadystate concentrations of clarithromycin and 14OH clarithromycin observed following administration of 500 mg doses of clarithromycin every 12 hours to adult patients with HIV infection were similar to those observed in healthy volunteers. In adult HIVinfected patients taking 500 mg or 1000 mg doses of clarithromycin every 12 hours, steadystate clarithromycin Cmax values ranged from 2 to 4 mcgmL and 5 to 10 mcgmL, respectively. The steadystate concentrations of clarithromycin in subjects with impaired hepatic function did not differ from those in normal subjects however, the 14OH clarithromycin concentrations were lower in the hepatically impaired subjects. The decreased formation of 14OH clarithromycin was at least partially offset by an increase in renal clearance of clarithromycin in the subjects with impaired hepatic function when compared to healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin was also altered in subjects with impaired renal function. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Clarithromycin and the 14OH clarithromycin metabolite distribute readily into body tissues and fluids. There are no data available on cerebrospinal fluid penetration. Because of high intracellular concentrations, tissue concentrations are higher than serum concentrations. Examples of tissue and serum concentrations are presented below.

The plasma levels of clarithromycin and 14hydroxyclarithromycin were increased by the concomitant administration of omeprazole. For clarithromycin, the mean Cmax was 10 greater, the mean Cmin was 27 greater, and the mean AUC08 was 15 greater when clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole than when clarithromycin was administered alone. Similar results were seen for 14hydroxyclarithromycin, the mean Cmax was 45 greater, the mean Cmin was 57 greater, and the mean AUC08 was 45 greater.

Microbiology Clarithromycin exerts its antibacterial action by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. Clarithromycin is active in vitro against a variety of aerobic and anaerobic Grampositive and Gramnegative bacteria as well as most Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria. Additionally, the 14OH clarithromycin metabolite also has clinically significant antimicrobial activity. The 14OH clarithromycin is twice as active against Haemophilus influenzae microorganisms as the parent compound. However, for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) isolates the 14OH metabolite is 4 to 7 times less active than clarithromycin. The clinical significance of this activity against Mycobacterium avium complex is unknown. Clarithromycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section Grampositive Microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gramnegative Microorganisms Haemophilus influenzae Haemophilus parainfluenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Other Microorganisms Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) Mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) consisting of Mycobacterium avium Mycobacterium intracellulare Betalactamase production should have no effect on clarithromycin activity. NOTE Most isolates of methicillinresistant and oxacillinresistant staphylococci are resistant to clarithromycin. Omeprazoleclarithromycin dual therapy ranitidine bismuth citrateclarithromycin dual therapy omeprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin triple therapy and lansoprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin triple therapy have been shown to be active against most strains of Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. Helicobacter Helicobacter pylori Pretreatment Resistance Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rates were 3.5 (4113) in the omeprazoleclarithromycin dualtherapy studies (M93067, M93100) and 9.3 (41439) in the omeprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin tripletherapy studies (126, 127, M96446). Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance was 12.6 (44348) in the ranitidine bismuth citrateclarithromycin b.i.d. versus t.i.d. clinical study (H2BA3001). Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rates were 9.5 (91960) by Etest and 11.3 (12106) by agar dilution in the lansoprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin tripletherapy clinical trials (M93125, M93130, M93131, M95392, and M95399). Amoxicillin pretreatment susceptible isolates (0.25 mcgmL) were found in 99.3 (436439) of the patients in the omeprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin clinical studies (126, 127, M96446). Amoxicillin pretreatment minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 0.25 mcgmL occurred in 0.7 (3439) of the patients, all of whom were in the clarithromycinamoxicillin study arm. Amoxicillin pretreatment susceptible isolates (0.25 mcgmL) occurred in 97.8 (936957) and 98.0 (98100) of the patients in the lansoprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin tripletherapy clinical trials by Etest and agar dilution, respectively. Twentyone of the 957 patients (2.2) by Etest and 2 of 100 patients (2.0) by agar dilution had amoxicillin pretreatment MICs of 0.25 mcgmL. Two patients had an unconfirmed pretreatment amoxicillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 256 mcgmL by Etest.

Therefore, for patients who fail therapy, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done, if possible. Patients with clarithromycin resistant H. pylori should not be treated with any of the following omeprazoleclarithromycin dual therapy ranitidine bismuth citrateclarithromycin dual therapy omeprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin triple therapy lansoprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin triple therapy or other regimens which include clarithromycin as the sole antimicrobial agent. Amoxicillin Susceptibility Test Results and ClinicalBacteriological Outcomes In the omeprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin tripletherapy clinical trials, 84.9 (157185) of the patients who had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs (0.25 mcgmL) were eradicated of H. pylori and 15.1 (28185) failed therapy. Of the 28 patients who failed triple therapy, 11 had no posttreatment susceptibility test results, and 17 had posttreatment H. pylori isolates with amoxicillin susceptible MICs. Eleven of the patients who failed triple therapy also had posttreatment H. pylori isolates with clarithromycin resistant MICs. In the lansoprazoleclarithromycinamoxicillin tripletherapy clinical trials, 82.6 (195236) of the patients that had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs (0.25 mcgmL) were eradicated of H. pylori. Of those with pretreatment amoxicillin MICs of 0.25 mcgmL, three of six had the H. pylori eradicated. A total of 12.8 (22172) of the patients failed the 10and 14day tripletherapy regimens. Posttreatment susceptibility results were not obtained on 11 of the patients who failed therapy. Nine of the 11 patients with amoxicillin posttreatment MICs that failed the tripletherapy regimen also had clarithromycin resistant H. pylori isolates. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Clarithromycin exhibits in vitro activity against most isolates of the following bacteria however, the safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria have not been established in adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials. Grampositive Bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococci (Groups C, F, G) Viridans group streptococci Gramnegative Bacteria Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Pasteurella multocida Grampositive Bacteria Clostridium perfringens Peptococcus niger Propionibacterium acnes Gramnegative Anaerobic Bacteria Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteriodes melaninogenicus) Susceptibility Testing Methods (Excluding Mycobacteria and Helicobacter) Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of clarithromycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Staphylococcus aureus MIC (mcgmL) Interpretation 2.0 Susceptible (S) 4.0 Intermediate (I) 8.0 Resistant (R) Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniaeThese interpretive standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests using cationadjusted MuellerHinton broth with 2 to 5 lysed horse blood. MIC (mcgmL) Interpretation 0.25 Susceptible (S) 0.5 Intermediate (I) 1.0 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus spp.These interpretive standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests with Haemophilus spp. using Haemophilus Testing Medium (HTM).1 MIC (mcgmL) Interpretation 8.0 Susceptible (S) 16.0 Intermediate (I) 32.0 Resistant (R) Note When testing Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, susceptibility and resistance to clarithromycin can be predicted using erythromycin. A report of Susceptible indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of Intermediate indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable other therapy should be selected. Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control bacteria to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents in the assay, and the techniques of the individual performing the test.1 ,2 Standard clarithromycin powder should provide the following MIC ranges.

ATCC 49247 4 to 16 Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized method.2 ,3 The procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 15 mcg of clarithromycin to test the susceptibility of bacteria.

ATCC 49247 11 to 17 In vitro Activity of Clarithromycin against Mycobacteria Clarithromycin has demonstrated in vitro activity against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) microorganisms isolated from both AIDS and nonAIDS patients. While gene probe techniques may be used to distinguish M. avium species from M. intracellulare , many studies only reported results on M. avium complex (MAC) isolates. Various in vitro methodologies employing broth or solid media at different pHs, with and without oleic acidalbumindextrosecatalase (OADC), have been used to determine clarithromycin MIC values for mycobacterial species. In general, MIC values decrease more than 16fold as the pH of Middlebrook 7H12 broth media increases from 5.0 to 7.4. At pH 7.4, MIC values determined with MuellerHinton agar were 4 to 8fold higher than those observed with Middlebrook 7H12 media. Utilization of oleic acidalbumindextrosecatalase (OADC) in these assays has been shown to further alter MIC values. Clarithromycin activity against 80 MAC isolates from AIDS patients and 211 MAC isolates from nonAIDS patients was evaluated using a microdilution method with Middlebrook 7H9 broth. Results showed an MIC value of 4.0 mcgmL in 81 and 89 of the AIDS and nonAIDS MAC isolates, respectively. Twelve percent of the nonAIDS isolates had an MIC value 0.5 mcgmL. Clarithromycin was also shown to be active against phagocytized M. avium complex (MAC) in mouse and human macrophage cell cultures as well as in the beige mouse infection model. Clarithromycin activity was evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis microorganisms. In one study utilizing the agar dilution method with Middlebrook 7H10 media, 3 of 30 clinical isolates had an MIC of 2.5 mcgmL. Clarithromycin inhibited all isolates at 10.0 mcgmL. Susceptibility Testing for Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) The disk diffusion and dilution techniques for susceptibility testing against grampositive and gramnegative bacteria should not be used for determining clarithromycin MIC values against mycobacteria. In vitro susceptibility testing methods and diagnostic products currently available for determining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms have not been standardized or validated. Clarithromycin MIC values will vary depending on the susceptibility testing method employed, composition and pH of the media, and the utilization of nutritional supplements. Breakpoints to determine whether clinical isolates of M. avium or M. intracellulare are susceptible or resistant to clarithromycin have not been established. Susceptibility Test for Helicobacter pylori The reference methodology for susceptibility testing of H. pylori is agar dilution MICs4 One to three microliters of an inoculum equivalent to a No. 2 McFarland standard (1 x 1071 x 108 CFUmL for H. pylori) are inoculated directly onto freshly prepared antimicrobial containing MuellerHinton agar plates with 5 aged defibrinated sheep blood (2weeks old). The agar dilution plates are incubated at 35C in a microaerobic environment produced by a gas generating system suitable for Campylobacter species. After 3 days of incubation, the MICs are recorded as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent required to inhibit growth of the organism. The clarithromycin and amoxicillin MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria H. pylori Clarithromycin MIC (mcgmL) These are tentative breakpoints for the agar dilution methodology, and should not be used to interpret results obtained using alternative methods.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL STUDIES Mycobacterial Infections Prophylaxis A randomized, doubleblind study (561) compared clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. to placebo in patients with CDCdefined AIDS and CD4 counts 100 cellsL. This study accrued 682 patients from November 1992 to January 1994, with a median CD4 cell count at study entry of 30 cellsL. Median duration of clarithromycin was 10.6 months vs. 8.2 months for placebo. More patients in the placebo arm than the clarithromycin arm discontinued prematurely from the study (75.6 and 67.4, respectively). However, if premature discontinuations due to MAC or death are excluded, approximately equal percentages of patients on each arm (54.8 on clarithromycin and 52.5 on placebo) discontinued study drug early for other reasons. The study was designed to evaluate the following endpoints MAC bacteremia, defined as at least one positive culture for M. avium complex bacteria from blood or another normally sterile site. Survival Clinically significant disseminated MAC disease, defined as MAC bacteremia accompanied by signs or symptoms of serious MAC infection, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, anemia, or elevations in liver function tests. MAC Bacteremia In patients randomized to clarithromycin, the risk of MAC bacteremia was reduced by 69 compared to placebo. The difference between groups was statistically significant (p0.001). On an intenttotreat basis, the oneyear cumulative incidence of MAC bacteremia was 5.0 for patients randomized to clarithromycin and 19.4 for patients randomized to placebo. While only 19 of the 341 patients randomized to clarithromycin developed MAC, 11 of these cases were resistant to clarithromycin. The patients with resistant MAC bacteremia had a median baseline CD4 count of 10 cellsmm3 (range 2 to 25 cellsmm3). Information regarding the clinical course and response to treatment of the patients with resistant MAC bacteremia is limited. The 8 patients who received clarithromycin and developed susceptible MAC bacteremia had a median baseline CD4 count of 25 cellsmm3 (range 10 to 80 cellsmm3). Comparatively, 53 of the 341 placebo patients developed MAC none of these isolates were resistant to clarithromycin. The median baseline CD4 count was 15 cellsmm3 (range 2 to 130 cellsmm3) for placebo patients that developed MAC. Survival A statistically significant survival benefit was observed.

Survival All Randomized Patients Graph Clinically Significant Disseminated MAC Disease In association with the decreased incidence of bacteremia, patients in the group randomized to clarithromycin showed reductions in the signs and symptoms of disseminated MAC disease, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, and anemia. Safety In AIDS patients treated with clarithromycin over long periods of time for prophylaxis against M. avium , it was often difficult to distinguish adverse events possibly associated with clarithromycin administration from underlying HIV disease or intercurrent illness. Median duration of treatment was 10.6 months for the clarithromycin group and 8.2 months for the placebo group.

These studies accrued patients from May 1991 to March 1992. Study 500 was randomized, doubleblind Study 577 was openlabel compassionate use. Both studies used 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. doses Study 500 also had a 2000 mg b.i.d. group. Study 521 was a pediatric study at 3.75, 7.5, and 15 mgkg b.i.d. Study 500 enrolled 154 adult patients, Study 577 enrolled 469 adult patients, and Study 521 enrolled 25 patients between the ages of 1 to 20. The majority of patients had CD4 cell counts 50mcL at study entry. The studies were designed to evaluate the following end points Change in MAC bacteremia or blood cultures negative for M. avium . Change in clinical signs and symptoms of MAC infection including one or more of the following fever, night sweats, weight loss, diarrhea, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. The results for the 500 study are described below. The 577 study results were similar to the results of the 500 study. Results with the 7.5 mgkg b.i.d. dose in the pediatric study were comparable to those for the 500 mg b.i.d. regimen in the adult studies. Study 069 compared the safety and efficacy of clarithromycin in combination with ethambutol versus clarithromycin in combination with ethambutol and clofazimine for the treatment of disseminated MAC (dMAC) infection5. This 24week study enrolled 106 patients with AIDS and dMAC, with 55 patients randomized to receive clarithromycin and ethambutol, and 51 patients randomized to receive clarithromycin, ethambutol, and clofazimine. Baseline characteristics between study arms were similar with the exception of median CFU counts being at least 1 log higher in the clarithromycin, ethambutol, and clofazimine arm. Compared to prior experience with clarithromycin monotherapy, the twodrug regimen of clarithromycin and ethambutol was well tolerated and extended the time to microbiologic relapse, largely through suppressing the emergence of clarithromycin resistant strains. However, the addition of clofazimine to the regimen added no additional microbiologic or clinical benefit. Tolerability of both multidrug regimens was comparable with the most common adverse events being gastrointestinal in nature. Patients receiving the clofaziminecontaining regimen had reduced survival rates however, their baseline mycobacterial colony counts were higher. The results of this trial support the addition of ethambutol to clarithromycin for the treatment of initial dMAC infections but do not support adding clofazimine as a third agent. MAC Bacteremia Decreases in MAC bacteremia or negative blood cultures were seen in the majority of patients in all dose groups. Mean reductions in colony forming units (CFU) are shown below. Included in the table are results from a separate study with a four drug regimen6 (ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, rifampicin, and clofazimine). Since patient populations and study procedures may vary between these two studies, comparisons between the clarithromycin results and the combination therapy results should be interpreted cautiously.

The percent of patients whose blood was sterilized as shown by one or more negative cultures at any time during acute therapy was 61 (3049) for the 500 mg b.i.d. group and 59 (2949) and 52 (2548) for the 1000 and 2000 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively. The percent of patients who had 2 or more negative cultures during acute therapy that were sustained through study Day 84 was 25 (1249) in both the 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. groups and 8 (448) for the 2000 mg b.i.d. group. By Day 84, 23 (1149), 37 (1849), and 56 (2748) of patients had died or discontinued from the study, and 14 (749), 12 (649), and 13 (648) of patients had relapsed in the 500, 1000, and 2000 mg b.i.d. dose groups, respectively. All of the isolates had an MIC 8 mcgmL at pretreatment. Relapse was almost always accompanied by an increase in MIC. The median time to first negative culture was 54, 41, and 29 days for the 500, 1000, and 2000 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively. The time to first decrease of at least 1 log in CFU count was significantly shorter with the 1000 and 2000 mg b.i.d. doses (median equal to 16 and 15 days, respectively) in comparison to the 500 mg b.i.d. group (median equal to 29 days). The median time to first positive culture or study discontinuation following the first negative culture was 43, 59 and 43 days for the 500, 1000, and 2000 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively. Clinically Significant Disseminated MAC Disease Among patients experiencing night sweats prior to therapy, 84 showed resolution or improvement at some point during the 12 weeks of clarithromycin at 500 to 2000 mg b.i.d. doses. Similarly, 77 of patients reported resolution or improvement in fevers at some point. Response rates for clinical signs of MAC are given below Resolution of Fever Resolution of Night Sweats b.i.d . dose (mg)  ever afebrile  afebrile 6 weeks b.i.d . dose (mg)  ever resolving  resolving 6 weeks 500 67 23 500 85 42 1000 67 12 1000 70 33 2000 62 22 2000 72 36 Weight Gain 3 Hemoglobin Increase 1 gm b.i.d . dose (mg)  ever gaining  gaining 6 weeks b.i.d . dose (mg)  ever increasing  increasing 6 weeks 500 33 14 500 58 26 1000 26 17 1000 37 6 2000 26 12 2000 62 18 The median duration of response, defined as improvement or resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, was 2 to 6 weeks. Since the study was not designed to determine the benefit of monotherapy beyond 12 weeks, the duration of response may be underestimated for the 25 to 33 of patients who continued to show clinical response after 12 weeks. Survival Median survival time from study entry (Study 500) was 249 days at the 500 mg b.i.d. dose compared to 215 days with the 1000 mg b.i.d. dose. However, during the first 12 weeks of therapy, there were 2 deaths in 53 patients in the 500 mg b.i.d. group versus 13 deaths in 51 patients in the 1000 mg b.i.d. group. The reason for this apparent mortality difference is not known. Survival in the two groups was similar beyond 12 weeks. The median survival times for these dosages were similar to recent historical controls with MAC when treated with combination therapies.5 Median survival time from study entry in Study 577 was 199 days for the 500 mg b.i.d. dose and 179 days for the 1000 mg b.i.d. dose. During the first four weeks of therapy, while patients were maintained on their originally assigned dose, there were 11 deaths in 255 patients taking 500 mg b.i.d. and 18 deaths in 214 patients taking 1000 mg b.i.d. Safety The adverse event profiles showed that both the 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. doses were well tolerated. The 2000 mg b.i.d. dose was poorly tolerated and resulted in a higher proportion of premature discontinuations. In AIDS patients and other immunocompromised patients treated with the higher doses of clarithromycin over long periods of time for mycobacterial infections, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse events possibly associated with clarithromycin administration from underlying signs of HIV disease or intercurrent illness. The following analyses summarize experience during the first 12 weeks of therapy with clarithromycin. Data are reported separately for Study 500 (randomized, doubleblind) and Study 577 (openlabel, compassionate use) and also combined. Adverse events were reported less frequently in Study 577, which may be due in part to differences in monitoring between the two studies. In adult patients receiving clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., the most frequently reported adverse events, considered possibly or probably related to study drug, with an incidence of 5 or greater, are listed below. Most of these events were mild to moderate in severity, although 5 (Study 500 8 Study 577 4) of patients receiving 500 mg b.i.d. and 5 (Study 500 4 Study 577 6) of patients receiving 1000 mg b.i.d. reported severe adverse events. Excluding those patients who discontinued therapy or died due to complications of their underlying nonmycobacterial disease, approximately 8 (Study 500 15 Study 577 7) of the patients who received 500 mg b.i.d. and 12 (Study 500 14 Study 577 12) of the patients who received 1000 mg b.i.d. discontinued therapy due to drugrelated events during the first 12 weeks of therapy. Overall, the 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. doses had similar adverse event profiles. TreatmentrelatedIncludes those events possibly or probably related to study drug and excludes concurrent conditions.

For the 223 patients who were evaluated for clinical efficacy, the clinical success rate (i.e., cure plus improvement) at the posttherapy visit was 88 for clarithromycin and 91 for the cephalosporin.

In two other controlled clinical trials of acute otitis media performed in the United States, where significant rates of betalactamase producing organisms were found, clarithromycin was compared to an oral antimicrobial agent that contained a specific betalactamase inhibitor. In these studies, very strict evaluability criteria were used to determine the clinical responses. In the 233 patients who were evaluated for clinical efficacy, the combined clinical success rate (i.e., cure and improvement) at the posttherapy visit was 91 for both clarithromycin and the control.

Duodenal Ulcer Associated with H. pylori Infection Clarithromycin  Lansoprazole and Amoxicillin H. pylori Eradication for Reducing the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Two U.S. randomized, doubleblind clinical studies in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an active ulcer within one year) evaluated the efficacy of clarithromycin in combination with lansoprazole and amoxicillin capsules as triple 14day therapy for eradication of H. pylori. Based on the results of these studies, the safety and efficacy of the following eradication regimen were established Triple therapy Clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d.  Lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d.  Amoxicillin 1 gm b.i.d. Treatment was for 14 days. H. pylori eradication was defined as two negative tests (culture and histology) at 4 to 6 weeks following the end of treatment. The combination of clarithromycin plus lansoprazole and amoxicillin as triple therapy was effective in eradicating H. pylori. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. A randomized, doubleblind clinical study performed in the U.S. in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within one year) compared the efficacy of clarithromycin in combination with lansoprazole and amoxicillin as triple therapy for 10 and 14 days. This study established that the 10day triple therapy was equivalent to the 14day triple therapy in eradicating H. pylori.

Two studies (Studies 126 and 127) were conducted in patients with an active duodenal ulcer, and the third study (Study 446) was conducted in patients with a duodenal ulcer in the past 5 years, but without an ulcer present at the time of enrollment. The dosage regimen in the studies was clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. plus omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. plus amoxicillin 1 gram b.i.d. for 10 days. In Studies 126 and 127, patients who took the omeprazole regimen also received an additional 18 days of omeprazole 20 mg q.d. Endpoints studied were eradication of H. pylori and duodenal ulcer healing (studies 126 and 127 only). H. pylori status was determined by CLOtest, histology, and culture in all three studies. For a given patient, H. pylori was considered eradicated if at least two of these tests were negative, and none was positive. The combination of clarithromycin plus omeprazole and amoxicillin was effective in eradicating H. pylori. PerProtocol and IntentToTreat H. pylori Eradication Rates  of Patients Cured 95 Confidence Interval Clarithromycin  Omeprazole  Amoxicillin Clarithromycin  Amoxicillin Per Protocol Patients were included in the analysis if they had confirmed duodenal ulcer disease (active ulcer studies 126 and 127 history of ulcer within 5 years, study M96446) and H. pylori infection at baseline defined as at least two of three positive endoscopic tests from CLOtest, histology, andor culture. Patients were included in the analysis if they completed the study. Additionally, if patients dropped out of the study due to an adverse event related to the study drug, they were included in the analysis as failures of therapy. The impact of eradication on ulcer recurrence has not been assessed in patients with a past history of ulcer. Intent ToTreat Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline and had confirmed duodenal ulcer disease.

Adverse reactions that have occurred have been limited to those that have been previously reported with clarithromycin, omeprazole, or amoxicillin. The most frequent adverse experiences observed in clinical trials using combination therapy with clarithromycin plus omeprazole and amoxicillin (n274) were diarrhea (14), taste perversion (10), and headache (7). For information about adverse reactions with omeprazole or amoxicillin, refer to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of their package inserts. Clarithromycin  Omeprazole Therapy Four randomized, doubleblind, multicenter studies (067, 100, 812b, and 058) evaluated clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. plus omeprazole 40 mg q.d. for 14 days, followed by omeprazole 20 mg q.d. (067, 100, and 058) or by omeprazole 40 mg q.d. (812b) for an additional 14 days in patients with active duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori. Studies 067 and 100 were conducted in the U.S. and Canada and enrolled 242 and 256 patients, respectively. H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer were confirmed in 219 patients in Study 067 and 228 patients in Study 100. These studies compared the combination regimen to omeprazole and clarithromycin monotherapies. Studies 812b and 058 were conducted in Europe and enrolled 154 and 215 patients, respectively. H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer were confirmed in 148 patients in Study 812b and 208 patients in Study 058. These studies compared the combination regimen to omeprazole monotherapy. The results for the efficacy analyses for these studies are described below. Duodenal Ulcer Healing The combination of clarithromycin and omeprazole was as effective as omeprazole alone for healing duodenal ulcer.

In the perprotocol analysis, the following patients were excluded dropouts, patients with major protocol violations, patients with missing H. pylori tests posttreatment, and patients that were not assessed for H. pylori eradication at 4 weeks after the end of treatment because they were found to have an unhealed ulcer at the end of treatment. Ulcer recurrence at 6months following the end of treatment was assessed for patients in whom ulcers were healed posttreatment.

Patients must have had two tests performed, and these must have been negative to be considered eradicated of H. pylori. The following patients were excluded from the perprotocol analysis patients not infected with H. pylori prestudy, dropouts, patients with major protocol violations, patients with missing H. pylori tests. Patients excluded from the intenttotreat analysis included those not infected with H. pylori prestudy and those with missing H. pylori tests prestudy. Patients were assessed for H. pylori eradication (4 weeks following treatment) regardless of their healing status (at the end of treatment). The relationship between H. pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer recurrence was assessed in a combined analysis of six U.S. randomized, doubleblind, multicenter, placebocontrolled trials using ranitidine bismuth citrate with or without antibiotics. The results from approximately 650 U.S. patients showed that the risk of ulcer recurrence within 6 months of completing treatment was two times less likely in patients whose H. pylori infection was eradicated compared to patients in whom H. pylori infection was not eradicated. Safety In clinical trials using combination therapy with clarithromycin plus ranitidine bismuth citrate, no adverse reactions peculiar to the combination of these drugs (using clarithromycin twice daily or three times a day) were observed.

Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when clarithromycin is administered to a nursing woman. It is known that clarithromycin is excreted in the milk of lactating animals and that other drugs of this class are excreted in human milk.

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Four teratogenicity studies in rats (three with oral doses and one with intravenous doses up to 160 mgkgday administered during the period of major organogenesis) and two in rabbits at oral doses up to 125 mgkgday (approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2) or intravenous doses of 30 mgkgday administered during gestation days 6 to 18 failed to demonstrate any teratogenicity from clarithromycin. Two additional oral studies in a different rat strain at similar doses and similar conditions demonstrated a low incidence of cardiovascular anomalies at doses of 150 mgkgday administered during gestation days 6 to 15. Plasma levels after 150 mgkgday were 2 times the human serum levels. Four studies in mice revealed a variable incidence of cleft palate following oral doses of 1000 mgkgday (2 and 4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2, respectively) during gestation days 6 to 15. Cleft palate was also seen at 500 mgkgday. The 1000 mgkgday exposure resulted in plasma levels 17 times the human serum levels. In monkeys, an oral dose of 70 mgkgday (an approximate equidose of the recommended maximum human dose based on mgm2) produced fetal growth retardation at plasma levels that were 2 times the human serum levels. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Clarithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS GeneralReview of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency. Clindamycin phosphate should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Clindamycin phosphate should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals. Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy. The use of clindamycin phosphate may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation. Clindamycin phosphate should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 1060 minutes as directed in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. Clindamycin dosage modification may not be necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin halflife has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease. Prescribing clindamycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drugresistant bacteria. Information for PatientsPatients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clindamycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clindamycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clindamycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory TestsDuring prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed. Drug InteractionsClindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin in vitro. Because of possible clinical significance, the two drugs should not be administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityLong term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative. Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mgkgday (approximately 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mgm2) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mgkgday (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mgm2, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mgkgday (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mgm2, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if it is clearly needed. Nursing MothersClindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk in the range of 0.7 to 3.8 mcgmL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Because of the potential for adverse reactions due to clindamycin in neonates (see Pediatric Use), the decision to discontinue the drug should be made, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric UseWhen clindamycin phosphate injection is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable. Usage in Newborns and InfantsThis product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal Gasping Syndrome in premature infants. The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated. Geriatric UseClinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibioticassociated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridium difficile) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (ageadjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clindamycin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Clindamycin Injection, USP is also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillinallergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibioticassociated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the WARNING box, before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin). Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Clindamycin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (except E. faecalis), and Staphylococcus aureus. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobes. Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tuboovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes. Intraabdominal infections including peritonitis and intraabdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms. Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis), and susceptible anaerobes. Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms. To reduce the development of drugresistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clindamycin and other antibacterial drugs, clindamycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS See WARNING box. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens. This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal Gasping Syndrome in premature infants. (See PRECAUTIONS  Pediatric Use). Usage in Meningitis Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis. SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE. OXYGEN AND INTRAVENOUS CORTICOSTEROIDS SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION If diarrhea occurs during therapy, this antibiotic should be discontinued. (See WARNING box). Adults Parenteral (I.M. or I.V. Administration) Serious infections due to aerobic grampositive cocci and the more susceptible anaerobes (NOT generally including Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus species and Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens) 600 to 1200 mgday in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. More severe infections, particularly those due to proven or suspected Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus species, or Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens 1200 to 2700 mgday in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. For more serious infections, these doses may have to be increased. In lifethreatening situations due to either aerobes or anaerobes, these doses may be increased. Doses of as much as 4800 mg daily have been given intravenously to adults. See Dilution and Infusion Rates section below. Single I.M. injections of greater than 600 mg are not recommended. Alternatively, drug may be administered in the form of a single rapid infusion of the first dose followed by continuous I.V. infusion as follows To maintain serum clindamycin levels Above 4 mcgmL Above 5 mcgmL Above 6 mcgmL Rapid infusion rate 10 mgmin for 30 min 15 mgmin for 30 min 20 mgmin for 30 min Maintenance infusion rate 0.75 mgmin 1 mgmin 1.25 mgmin Neonates (less than 1 month) 15 to 20 mgkgday in three to four equal doses. The lower dosage may be adequate for small prematures. Pediatric patients (1 month of age to 16 years) Parenteral (I.M. or I.V.) administration 20 to 40 mgkgday in 3 or 4 equal doses. The higher doses would be used for more severe infections. As an alternative to dosing on a body weight basis, pediatric patients may be dosed on the basis of square meters body surface 350 mgm2day for serious infections and 450 mgm2day for more severe infections. Parenteral therapy may be changed to clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution or clindamycin hydrochloride capsules when the condition warrants and at the discretion of the physician. In cases of hemolytic streptococcal infections, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Dilution and Infusion Rates Clindamycin phosphate must be diluted prior to I.V. administration. The concentration of clindamycin in diluent for infusion should not exceed 18 mg per mL. Infusion rates should not exceed 30 mg per minute. The usual infusion dilutions and rates are as follows Dose Diluent Time 300 mg 600 mg 900 mg 1200 mg 50 mL 50 mL 50100 mL 100 mL 10 min 20 min 30 min 40 min Administration of more than 1200 mg in a single 1hour infusion is not recommended.Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Dilution and Compatibility Physical and biological compatibility studies monitored for 24 hours at room temperature have demonstrated no inactivation or incompatibility with the use of clindamycin phosphate in I.V. solutions containing sodium chloride, glucose, calcium or potassium, and solutions containing vitamin B complex in concentrations usually used clinically. No incompatibility has been demonstrated with the antibiotics cephalothin, kanamycin, gentamicin, penicillin or carbenicillin. The following drugs are physically incompatible with clindamycin phosphate ampicillin sodium, phenytoin sodium, barbiturates, aminophylline, calcium gluconate, and magnesium sulfate. The compatibility and duration of stability of drug admixtures will vary depending on concentration and other conditions. PhysicoChemical Stability of Diluted Solutions of Clindamycin Room temperature 6, 9, and 12 mgmL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in 5 Dextrose Injection, 0.9 Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringers Injection in glass bottles or minibags, demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least 16 days at 25C. Also, 18 mgmL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in 5 Dextrose Injection, in minibags, demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least 16 days at 25C. Refrigeration 6, 9 and 12 mgmL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in 5 Dextrose Injection, 0.9 Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringers Injection in glass bottles or minibags, demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least 32 days at 4C. IMPORTANT This chemical stability information in no way indicates that it would be acceptable practice to use this product well after the preparation time. Good professional practice suggests that compounded admixtures should be administered as soon after preparation as is feasible. Frozen 6, 9 and 12 mgmL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in 5 Dextrose Injection, 0.9 Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringers Injection in minibags demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least eight weeks at 10C. Frozen solutions should be thawed at room temperature and not refrozen. Caution Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is rapidly converted to active clindamycin. By the end of shortterm intravenous infusion, peak serum levels of active clindamycin are reached. Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears rapidly from the serum the average elimination halflife is 6 minutes however, the serum elimination halflife of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2 hours in pediatric patients. After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak levels of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum level curves may be constructed from I.V. peak serum levels as given in Table 1 by application of elimination halflives listed above. Serum levels of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. The elimination halflife of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules need not be modified in the presence of mild or moderate renal or hepatic disease. No significant levels of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid, even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination halflife, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentrationtime curve) after I.V. administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, elimination halflife is increased to approximately 4 hours (range 3.4 to 5.1 h) in the elderly compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between the age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (ageadjusted) renal function1. Serum assays for active clindamycin require an inhibitor to prevent in vitro hydrolysis of clindamycin phosphate.

Microbiology Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive in vitro, rapid in vivo hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin. Clindamycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against isolates of the following organisms Aerobic gram positive cocci,including Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase producing strains). When tested by in vitro methods, some staphylococcal strains originally resistant to erythromycin rapidly develop resistance to clindamycin. Staphylococcus epidermidis (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase producing strains). When tested by in vitro methods, some staphylococcal strains originally resistant to erythromycin rapidly develop resistance to clindamycin. Streptococci (exceptEnterococcus faecalis) Pneumococci Anaerobic gram negative bacilli,including Bacteroides species (including Bacteroides fragilis group and Bacteroides melaninogenicus group) Fusobacterium species Anaerobic gram positive nonsporeforming bacilli, including Propionibacterium Eubacterium Actinomyces species Anaerobic and microaerophilic gram positive cocci, including Peptococcus species Peptostreptococcus species Microaerophilic streptococci Clostridia Clostridia are more resistant than most anaerobes to clindamycin. Most Clostridium perfringens are susceptible, but other species, e.g., Clostridium sporogenes and Clostridium tertium are frequently resistant to clindamycin. Susceptibility testing should be done. Cross resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and lincomycin. Antagonism has been demonstrated betweeen clindamycin and erythromycin. In vitro Susceptibility Testing Disk diffusion techniqueQuantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters give the most precise estimates of antibiotic susceptibility. One such procedure2 has been recommended for use with disks to test susceptibility to clindamycin. Reports from a laboratory using the standardized singledisk susceptibility test1 with a 2 mcg clindamycin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria Susceptible organisms produce zones of 17 mm or greater, indicating that the tested organism is likely to respond to therapy. Organisms of intermediate susceptibility produce zones of 1516 mm, indicating that the tested organism would be susceptible if a high dosage is used or if the infection is confined to tissues and fluids (e.g., urine), in which high antibiotic levels are attained. Resistant organisms produce zones of 14 mm or less, indicating that other therapy should be selected. Standardized procedures require the use of control organisms. The 2 mcg clindamycin disk should give a zone diameter between 24 and 30 mm for S. aureus ATCC 25923. Dilution techniques  A bacterial isolate may be considered susceptible if the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for clindamycin is not more than 1.6 mcgmL. Organisms are considered moderately susceptible if the MIC is greater than 1.6 mcgmL and less than or equal to 4.8 mcgmL. Organisms are considered resistant if the MIC is greater than 4.8 mcg per mL. The range of MICs for the control strains are as follows S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.06 to 0.25 mcgmL. E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 4 to 16 mcgmL. For anaerobic bacteria the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clindamycin can be determined by agar dilution and broth dilution (including microdilution) techniques.3 If MICs are not determined routinely, the disk broth method is recommended for routine use. The KIRBYBAUER DISK DIFFUSION METHOD AND ITS INTERPRETIVE STANDARDS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANAEROBES.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>WARNING Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. Because clindamycin therapy has been associated with severe colitis which may end fatally, it should be reserved for serious infections where less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate, as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. It should not be used in patients with nonbacterial infections such as most upper respiratory tract infections. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM The activity of OxyContin Tablets is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OxyContin Tablets are designed to provide controlled delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Breaking, chewing or crushing OxyContin Tablets eliminates the controlled delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OxyContin Tablets is pH independent. Oxycodone is well absorbed from OxyContin Tablets with an oral bioavailability of 60 to 87. The relative oral bioavailability of OxyContin to immediaterelease oral dosage forms is 100. Upon repeated dosing in normal volunteers in pharmacokinetic studies, steadystate levels were achieved within 2436 hours. Dose proportionality andor bioavailability has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC). Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination halflife of oxycodone following the administration of OxyContin was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediaterelease oxycodone.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively.

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of OxyContin is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis. The administration of oxycodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Interactions with other CNS Depressants OxyContin should be used with caution and started in a reduced dosage (13 to 12 of the usual dosage) in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of OxyContin. Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use OxyContin is not indicated for preemptive analgesia (administration preoperatively for the management of postoperative pain). OxyContin is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in this setting has not been established. OxyContin is not indicated for pain in the postoperative period if the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. OxyContin is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (See American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving OxyContin Tablets as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). OxyContin and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented. Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level. Tolerance and Physical Dependence Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy ). Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving OxyContin Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver Patients should be aware that OxyContin Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. Patients should be advised that OxyContin Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. OxyContin Tablets will release all their contents at once if broken, chewed, or crushed, resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of OxyContin without consulting the prescribing professional. Patients should be advised that OxyContin may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine OxyContin with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. Patients should be advised that OxyContin is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with OxyContin for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the OxyContin dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. Patients should be instructed to keep OxyContin in a secure place out of the reach of children. When OxyContin is no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction OxyContin is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addictive disorders. Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence, either active or in remission, is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia. DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including OxyContin, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Although clinical studies have not been conducted, the expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. If coadministration with OxyContin is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inducers of CYP3A4 Although clinical studies have not been conducted, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug, which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy, or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If coadministration with OxyContin is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inducers. These patients should be evaluated at frequent intervals and dose adjustments considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via cytochrome P450 2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance with this agent. Clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction, however. Use with CNS Depressants OxyContin, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, centrally acting antiemetics, tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. No specific interaction between oxycodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies of oxycodone to evaluate its carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Oxycodone was not mutagenic in the following assays Ames Salmonella and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at doses of up to 5000 g, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes in the absence of metabolic activation at doses of up to 1500 gmL and with activation 48 hours after exposure at doses of up to 5000 gmL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in mice (at plasma levels of up to 48 gmL). Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation in the human chromosomal aberration test (at greater than or equal to 1250 gmL) at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure and in the mouse lymphoma assay at doses of 50 gmL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 gmL or greater without metabolic activation. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects  Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits by oral administration at doses up to 8 mgkg and 125 mgkg, respectively. These doses are 3 and 46 times a human dose of 160 mgday, based on mgkg basis. The results did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery OxyContin is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Neonates whose mothers have been taking oxycodone chronically may exhibit respiratory depression andor withdrawal symptoms, either at birth andor in the nursery. Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of oxycodone have been detected in breast milk. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving OxyContin because of the possibility of sedation andor respiratory depression in the infant. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of OxyContin have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18. It must be remembered that OxyContin Tablets cannot be crushed or divided for administration. Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of OxyContin, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received OxyContin. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Laboratory Monitoring Due to the broad range of plasma concentrations seen in clinical populations, the varying degrees of pain, and the development of tolerance, plasma oxycodone measurements are usually not helpful in clinical management. Plasma concentrations of the active drug substance may be of value in selected, unusual or complex cases. Hepatic Impairment A study of OxyContin in patients with hepatic impairment indicates greater plasma concentrations than those with normal function. The initiation of therapy at 13 to 12 the usual doses and careful dose titration is warranted. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (60 mLmin), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50 higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Dose initiation should follow a conservative approach. Dosages should be adjusted according to the clinical situation. Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies, opioidnaive females demonstrate up to 25 higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no malefemale difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugDrug Interactions (see PRECAUTIONS) CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation and in theory can be affected by drugs affecting cytochrome P450 enzymes. Oxycodone is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 to oxymorphone which represents less than 15 of the total administered dose. This route of elimination may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs including amiodarone and quinidine as well as polycyclic antidepressants). However, in a study involving 10 subjects using quinidine, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were unchanged., DrugDrug Interactions Opioid analgesics, including OxyContin, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azoleantifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations.

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE OxyContin Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. OxyContin is NOT intended for use as a prn analgesic. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case, initiating therapy at the appropriate point along a progression from nonopioid analgesics, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acetaminophen to opioids in a plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly known as the Agency for HealthCare Policy and Research), the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines, or the American Pain Society. OxyContin is not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the first 1224 hours following surgery), or if the pain is mild, or not expected to persist for an extended period of time. OxyContin is only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate. (See American Pain Society guidelines.)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Absorption About 60 to 87 of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low presystemic andor firstpass metabolism. In normal volunteers, the t of absorption is 0.4 hours for immediaterelease oral oxycodone. In contrast, OxyContin Tablets exhibit a biphasic absorption pattern with two apparent absorption halflives of 0.6 and 6.9 hours, which describes the initial release of oxycodone from the tablet followed by a prolonged release., Plasma Oxycodone by Time Dose proportionality has been established for the 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 1 below). Another study established that the 160 mg tablet is bioequivalent to 2 x 80 mg tablets as well as to 4 x 40 mg for both peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 2 below). Given the short halflife of elimination of oxycodone from OxyContin, steadystate plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 2436 hours of initiation of dosing with OxyContin Tablets.

OxyContin is NOT INDICATED FOR RECTAL ADMINISTRATION. Data from a study involving 21 normal volunteers show that OxyContin Tablets administered per rectum resulted in an AUC 39 greater and a Cmax 9 higher than tablets administered by mouth. Therefore, there is an increased risk of adverse events with rectal administration. Oxycontin Figure, Food Effects Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from OxyContin. However, the peak plasma concentration of oxycodone increased by 25 when a OxyContin 160 mg Tablet was administered with a highfat meal., Distribution Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 Lkg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk (see PRECAUTIONS )., Metabolism Oxycodone hydrochloride is extensively metabolized to noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone, and their glucuronides. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known. CYP3A mediated Ndemethylation (to noroxycodone) is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated Odemethylation (to oxymorphone). Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs (see DrugDrug Interactions )., Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows free oxycodone up to 19 conjugated oxycodone up to 50 free oxymorphone 0 conjugated oxymorphone  14 both free and conjugated noroxycodone have been found in the urine but not quantified. The total plasma clearance was 0.8 Lmin for adults., SAFETY AND HANDLING OxyContin Tablets are solid dosage forms that contain oxycodone which is a controlled substance. Like morphine, oxycodone is controlled under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. OxyContin has been targeted for theft and diversion by criminals.

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of OxyContin was evaluated in doubleblind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In openlabel studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received OxyContin in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. Serious adverse reactions which may be associated with OxyContin Tablet therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, and (to an even lesser degree) circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock (see OVERDOSAGE ). The nonserious adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with OxyContin are typical opioid side effects. These events are dosedependent, and their frequency depends upon the dose, the clinical setting, the patients level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent (5) include constipation, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and asthenia. In many cases the frequency of these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large swings in the plasma concentrations of the opioid. Many of these adverse events will cease or decrease in intensity as OxyContin therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed. Clinical trials comparing OxyContin with immediaterelease oxycodone and placebo revealed a similar adverse event profile between OxyContin and immediaterelease oxycodone. The most common adverse events (5) reported by patients at least once during therapy were TABLE 3 OxyContin (n227) ImmediateRelease (n225) Placebo (n45) () () () Constipation (23) (26) (7) Nausea (23) (27) (11) Somnolence (23) (24) (4) Dizziness (13) (16) (9) Pruritus (13) (12) (2) <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b> (12) (14) (7) Headache (7) (8) (7) Dry Mouth (6) (7) (2) Asthenia (6) (7)  Sweating (5) (6) (2) The following adverse experiences were reported in OxyContintreated patients with an incidence between 1 and 5.

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS OxyContin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to oxycodone, or in any situation where opioids are contraindicated. This includes patients with significant respiratory depression (in unmonitored settings or the absence of resuscitative equipment), and patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia. OxyContin is contraindicated in any patient who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Principles OXYCONTIN IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO MORPHINE. OXYCODONE, LIKE MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN ANALGESIA, CAN BE ABUSED AND IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION. OXYCONTIN TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED OXYCONTIN TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE. One OxyContin 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be started on the lowest appropriate dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiation of Therapy ). In treating pain it is vital to assess the patient regularly and systematically. Therapy should also be regularly reviewed and adjusted based upon the patients own reports of pain and side effects and the health professionals clinical judgment. OxyContin Tablets are a controlledrelease oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, aroundtheclock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. The controlledrelease nature of the formulation allows OxyContin to be effectively administered every 12 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). While symmetric (same dose AM and PM), aroundtheclock, q12h dosing is appropriate for the majority of patients, some patients may benefit from asymmetric (different dose given in AM than in PM) dosing, tailored to their pain pattern. It is usually appropriate to treat a patient with only one opioid for aroundtheclock therapy. Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING ). Initiation of Therapy It is critical to initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patients prior opioid and nonopioid analgesic treatment. Attention should be given to (1)the general condition and medical status of the patient (2)the daily dose, potency, and kind of the analgesic(s) the patient has been taking (3)the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of oxycodone (4)the patients opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) (5)the Special Instructions for OxyContin 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg and (6)the balance between pain control and adverse experiences. Care should be taken to use low initial doses of OxyContin in patients who are not already opioidtolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS DrugDrug Interactions ). For initiation of OxyContin therapy for patients previously taking opioids, the conversion ratios from Foley, KM. NEJM, 1985 3138495, found below, are a reasonable starting point, although not verified in wellcontrolled, multipledose trials. Experience indicates a reasonable starting dose of OxyContin for patients who are taking nonopioid analgesics and require continuous aroundtheclock therapy for an extended period of time is 10 mg q12h. If a nonopioid analgesic is being provided, it may be continued. OxyContin should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. Using standard conversion ratio estimates (see Table 4 below), multiply the mgday of the previous opioids by the appropriate multiplication factors to obtain the equivalent total daily dose of oral oxycodone. When converting from oxycodone, divide the 24hour oxycodone dose in half to obtain the twice a day (q12h) dose of OxyContin. Round down to a dose which is appropriate for the tablet strengths available. Discontinue all other aroundtheclock opioid drugs when OxyContin therapy is initiated. No fixed conversion ratio is likely to be satisfactory in all patients, especially patients receiving large opioid doses. The recommended doses shown in Table 4 are only a starting point, and close observation and frequent titration are indicated until patients are stable on the new therapy. TABLE 4. Multiplication Factors for Converting the Daily Dose of Prior Opioids to the Daily Dose of Oral Oxycodone  To be used only for conversion to oral oxycodone. For patients receiving highdose parenteral opioids, a more conservative conversion is warranted. For example, for highdose parenteral morphine, use 1.5 instead of 3 as a multiplication factor. (MgDay Prior Opioid x Factor  MgDay Oral Oxycodone) Oral Prior Opioid Parenteral Prior Opioid Oxycodone 1  Codeine 0.15  Hydrocodone 0.9  Hydromorphone 4 20 Levorphanol 7.5 15 Meperidine 0.1 0.4 Methadone 1.5 3 Morphine 0.5 3 In all cases, supplemental analgesia should be made available in the form of a suitable shortacting analgesic. OxyContin can be safely used concomitantly with usual doses of nonopioid analgesics and analgesic adjuvants, provided care is taken to select a proper initial dose (see PRECAUTIONS ). Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to OxyContin Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, OxyContin treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg q12h of OxyContin, should be initially substituted for each 25 ghr fentanyl transdermal patch. The patient should be followed closely for early titration, as there is very limited clinical experience with this conversion. Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Experiences Most patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioidnaive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from OxyContin are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative andor stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids. Other opioidrelated side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually selflimited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered. Patients receiving OxyContin may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence. Individualization of Dosage Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steadystate plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25 to 50 of the current dose at each increase. If signs of excessive opioidrelated adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediaterelease oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, nonopioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioidrelated adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control. During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiverfamily. Special Instructions for OxyContin 60 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg Tablets or a Single Dose Greater Than 40 mg (for use in opioidtolerant patients only) OxyContin 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, are for use in opioidtolerant patients only. A single daily dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. One OxyContin 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a highfat meal, however, there is a 25 greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets. Supplemental Analgesia Most patients given aroundtheclock therapy with controlledrelease opioids may need to have immediaterelease medication available for exacerbations of pain or to prevent pain that occurs predictably during certain patient activities (incident pain). Maintenance of Therapy The intent of the titration period is to establish a patientspecific q12h dose that will maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects for as long as pain relief is necessary. Should pain recur then the dose can be incrementally increased to reestablish pain control. The method of therapy adjustment outlined above should be employed to reestablish pain control. During chronic therapy, especially for noncancer pain syndromes, the continued need for aroundtheclock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g., every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate. Cessation of Therapy When the patient no longer requires therapy with OxyContin Tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Conversion from OxyContin to Parenteral Opioids To avoid overdose, conservative dose conversion ratios should be followed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION OxyContin contains oxycodone, which is a full muagonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive use, use for nonmedical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. There is a potential for drug addiction to develop following exposure to opioids, including oxycodone. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. "Drugseeking" behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). "Doctor shopping" to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. OxyContin, like other opioids, has been diverted for nonmedical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. OxyContin consists of a dualpolymer matrix, intended for oral use only. Abuse of the crushed tablet poses a hazard of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. With parenteral abuse, the tablet excipients, especially talc, can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard from oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin, as with all opioid agonists. Respiratory depression is a particular problem in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative nonopioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. Head Injury The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Hypotensive Effect OxyContin may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphinetype, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</td></tr>

Only you and your doctor can decide if OxyContin is right for you. Share the important information in this leaflet with members of your household. What Is The Most Important Information I Should Know About OxyContin? Use OxyContin the way your doctor tells you to. Use OxyContin only for the condition for which it was prescribed. OxyContin is not for occasional ("as needed") use. Swallow the tablets whole. Do not break, crush, dissolve, or chew them before swallowing. OxyContin works properly over 12 hours only when swallowed whole. If a tablet is broken, crushed, dissolved, or chewed, the entire 12 hour dose will be absorbed into your body all at once. This can be dangerous, causing an overdose, and possibly death. Keep OxyContin out of the reach of children. Accidental overdose by a child is dangerous and may result in death. Prevent theft and misuse. OxyContin contains a narcotic painkiller that can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines. Therefore, keep your tablets in a secure place, to protect them from theft. Never give them to anyone else. Selling or giving away this medicine is dangerous and against the law. What is OxyContin? OxyContin is a tablet that comes in several strengths and contains the medicine oxycodone (oxeKOEdone). This medicine is a painkiller like morphine. OxyContin treats moderate to severe pain that is expected to last for an extended period of time. Use OxyContin regularly during treatment. It contains enough medicine to last for up to twelve hours. Who Should Not Take OxyContin? Do not take OxyContin if your doctor did not prescribe OxyContin for you. your pain is mild or will go away in a few days. your pain can be controlled by occasional use of other painkillers. you have severe asthma or severe lung problems. you have had a severe allergic reaction to codeine, hydrocodone, dihydrocodeine, or oxycodone (such as Tylox, Tylenol with Codeine, or Vicodin). A severe allergic reaction includes a severe rash, hives, breathing problems, or dizziness. you had surgery less than 12  24 hours ago and you were not taking OxyContin just before surgery. Your doctor should know about all your medical conditions before deciding if OxyContin is right for you and what dose is best. Tell your doctor about all of your medical problems, especially the ones listed below trouble breathing or lung problems head injury liver or kidney problems adrenal gland problems, such as Addisons disease convulsions or seizures alcoholism hallucinations or other severe mental problems past or present substance abuse or drug addiction If any of these conditions apply to you, and you havent told your doctor, then you should tell your doctor before taking OxyContin. If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, talk with your doctor. OxyContin may not be right for you. Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. OxyContin will pass through the milk and may harm the baby. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take , including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. They may cause serious medical problems when taken with OxyContin, especially if they cause drowsiness. How Should I Take OxyContin? Follow your doctors directions exactly. Your doctor may change your dose based on your reactions to the medicine. Do not change your dose unless your doctor tells you to change it. Do not take OxyContin more often than prescribed. Swallow the tablets whole. Do not break, crush, dissolve, or chew before swallowing. If the tablets are not whole, your body will absorb too much medicine at one time. This can lead to serious problems, including overdose and death. If you miss a dose , take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once unless your doctor tells you to. In case of overdose , call your local emergency number or Poison Control Center right away. Review your pain regularly with your doctor to determine if you still need OxyContin. You may see tablets in your stools (bowel movements). Do not be concerned. Your body has already absorbed the medicine. If you continue to have pain or bothersome side effects, call your doctor. Stopping OxyContin. Consult your doctor for instructions on how to stop this medicine slowly to avoid uncomfortable symptoms. You should not stop taking OxyContin all at once if you have been taking it for more than a few days. After you stop taking OxyContin, flush the unused tablets down the toilet. What Should I Avoid While Taking OxyContin? Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or participate in any other possibly dangerous activities until you know how you react to this medicine. OxyContin can make you sleepy. Do not drink alcohol while using OxyContin. It may increase the chance of getting dangerous side effects. Do not take other medicines without your doctors approval. Other medicines include prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and supplements. Be especially careful about products that make you sleepy. What are the Possible Side Effects of OxyContin? Call your doctor or get medical help right away if your breathing slows down you feel faint, dizzy, confused, or have any other unusual symptoms Some of the common side effects of OxyContin are nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, itching, dry mouth, sweating, weakness, and headache. Some of these side effects may decrease with continued use. There is a risk of abuse or addiction with narcotic painkillers. If you have abused drugs in the past, you may have a higher chance of developing abuse or addiction again while using OxyContin. These are not all the possible side effects of OxyContin. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist. General Advice About OxyContin Do not use OxyContin for conditions for which it was not prescribed. Do not give OxyContin to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. Sharing is illegal and may cause severe medical problems, including death.

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>Information for PatientsCaregivers If clinically advisable, patients receiving OxyContin Tablets or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver Patients should be aware that OxyContin Tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. Patients should be advised that OxyContin Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole. OxyContin Tablets will release all their contents at once if broken, chewed, or crushed, resulting in a risk of fatal overdose. Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of OxyContin without consulting the prescribing professional. Patients should be advised that OxyContin may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine OxyContin with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because dangerous additive effects may occur, resulting in serious injury or death. Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. Patients should be advised that OxyContin is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed. Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with OxyContin for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the OxyContin dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. Patients should be instructed to keep OxyContin in a secure place out of the reach of children. When OxyContin is no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>"General Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension. Use of OxyContin is associated with increased potential risks and should be used only with caution in the following conditions acute alcoholism adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addisons disease) CNS depression or coma delirium tremens debilitated patients kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression myxedema or hypothyroidism prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function and toxic psychosis.

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS OXYCONTIN TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED. TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, OR CRUSHED OXYCONTIN TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF OXYCODONE. OxyContin 60 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, ARE FOR USE IN OPIOIDTOLERANT PATIENTS ONLY. A single dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing OxyContin in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. OxyContin has been reported as being abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death (see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ). Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Oxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone is a pure agonist opioid whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression, as well as analgesia. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing analgesia, unlike with mixed agonistantagonists or nonopioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the analgesic effect with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include somnolence and respiratory depression. Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioidlike activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of OxyContin overdose (See OVERDOSAGE ). Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release andor peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, andor orthostatic hypotension. Concentration  Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall "drug effect", analgesia and feelings of "relaxation". As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for analgesia will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome andor the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration  Adverse Experience Relationships OxyContin Tablets are associated with typical opioidrelated adverse experiences. There is a general relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of doserelated opioid adverse experiences such as nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioidtolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioidrelated side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant. As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL TRIALS A doubleblind placebocontrolled, fixeddose, parallel group, twoweek study was conducted in 133 patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain, who were judged as having inadequate pain control with their current therapy. In this study, 20 mg OxyContin q12h but not 10 mg OxyContin q12h decreased pain compared with placebo, and this difference was statistically significant.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>Special Populations Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects. Gender Female subjects have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25 higher than males on a body weight adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown. Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 60 mLmin) show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60, 50, and 40 higher than normal subjects, respectively. This is accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in t of elimination for oxycodone of only 1 hour (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50 and 20 higher, respectively, than normal subjects. AUC values are 95 and 65 higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30 and 40. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The t elimination for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS ).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Elderly The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15 greater in elderly as compared to young subjects., Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone appeared to be slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15 (see PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM ). Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of OxyContin, 148 (33.3) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected side effects were seen in the elderly patients who received OxyContin. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals are appropriate for these patients. As with all opioids, the starting dose should be reduced to 13 to 12 of the usual dosage in debilitated, nontolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in nontolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of OxyContin, by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when OxyContin is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. In the treatment of oxycodone overdosage, primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists such as naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes against respiratory depression from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including OxyContin, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION Sodium Iodide I 131 (Na I131) Capsules Therapeutic is supplied for oral administration in opaque white gelatin capsules. The capsules are available in strengths ranging from 28 to 3700 MBq (0.75 to 100 mCi) iodine131 at the time of calibration. Sodium iodide I131 capsules are packaged in shielded, plastic vials containing one capsule per vial. Sodium iodide I131 capsules are prepared by absorbing a solution of carrierfree sodium iodide I131 that may contain sodium bisulfite into inert filler. The iodine131 utilized in the preparation of the capsules contains not less than 99 iodine131 at the time of calibration. The calibration date and the expiration date are stated on the label. 11.1 Physical Characteristics Iodine131 decays by beta emission and associated gamma emission with a physical halflife of 8.02 days3. The principal beta emissions and gamma photons are listed in Table 4. Table 4. Principal Radiation Emission Data Radiation Mean Percent Per Disintegration Energy (keV) Beta1 2.10 69.4 Avg. Beta3 7.27 96.6 Avg. Beta4 89.9 191.6 Avg. Gamma7 6.14 284.3 Gamma14 81.7 364.5 Gamma17 7.17 637.0 11.2 External Radiation The specific gamma ray constant for iodine131 is 2.20 RhrmCi at 1 cm. The first halfvalue thickness of lead (Pb) for iodine131 is 0.27 cm. A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 5. For example, the use of 4.5 cm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1,000. Table 5. Radiation Attenuation by Lead Shielding4 Shield Thickness (Pb), cm Coefficient of Attenuation 0.27 0.5 0.99 101 2.6 102 4.5 103 To correct for physical decay of this radionuclide, the fractions that remain at selected time intervals after the date of calibration are shown in Table 6.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use safe handling measures to minimize inadvertent radiation exposure. (2.1) Hyperthyroidism 148 to 370 megabecquerels (MBq) (4 to 10 millicuries, mCi). Toxic nodular goiter and other situations may require larger doses. (2.2) Thyroid Carcinoma For thyroid carcinoma, 3700 to 5550 MBq (100 to 150 mCi). (2.3) For postoperative ablation of normal thyroid tissue 1850 MBq (50 mCi). (2.3) Individualize therapy, including dose selection, based upon patientspecific factors detected during the therapeutic planning process. (2.4) 2.1 Radiation Safety Sodium iodide I131 capsules emit radiation and must be handled with safety measures to minimize inadvertent radiation exposure to clinical personnel and patients see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ). Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by or under the direction of phyxadsicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate governmental agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides. Wear waterproof gloves during the entire sodium iodide I131 capsule handling and administration procedure. Maintain adequate shielding during the radiationemitting life of the product. Measure the patient dose using a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration. 2.2 Hyperthyroidism For hyperthyroidism, the usual sodium iodide I131 dose range is 148 to 370 MBq (4 to 10 mCi). Higher doses may be necessary for the treatment of toxic nodular goiter and other special situations. Consider discontinuation of antithyroid therapy in a severely hyperthyroid paxadtient three to four days before administration of sodium iodide I131. Evaluate patients for risk of thyroid enlargement and obstruction of structures in the neck see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 ). 2.3 Thyroid Carcinoma For thyroid carcinoma, the usual sodium iodide I131 therapeutic dose is 3700 to 5550 MBq (100 to 150 mCi). For ablation of postoperative residual thyroid tissue, the usual dose is 1850 MBq (50 mCi). 2.4 Individualization of Therapy Individualize sodium iodide I131 therapy, including dose selection, based upon patientspecific factors such as the nature of the underlying condition, comorbidities, age, estimated thyroid tissue iodine uptake, thyroid size, as well as ability of the patient to comply with the therapeutic regimen and radiation safety procedures. Perform a clinical assessment, including history, physical examination and laboratory testing when preparing patients for sodium iodide I131 therapy in order to detect conditions which may alter thyroid iodine uptake and increase the risks of the therapy or diminish its effectiveness. For example, intake of iodine in radiographic contrast may diminish thyroid iodine uptake while low serum chloride or nephrosis may increase thyroid iodine uptake. Obtain a drug history and ascertain whether any medications need to be withheld before the administration of the therapy see Drug Interactions (7). 2.5 Radiation Dosimetry The estimated absorbed radiation doses1 to an average (70 kg) euthyroid (normal functioning thyxadroid) patient from an oral dose of iodine131 in both milligray (mGy) per megabecquerel (MBq) and rad per millicurie (mCi) are shown in Table 1.

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Taken orally, sodium iodide I131 is rapidly absorbed and distributed within the extracellular fluid of the body. The iodide is concentrated in the thyroid via the sodiumiodide symporter, and subsequently oxidized to iodine. The destruction of thyroidal tissue is achieved by the beta emission of sodium iodide I131. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The therapeutic effects of sodium iodide I131 are a result of the ionizing radiation absorbed by the thyroidal tissue. Tissue damage is the result of direct insult to molecules by ionization and excitation and the consequent dissociation of those molecules. About 90 of local irradiation from sodium iodide I131 is the result of beta radiation and 10 is the result of gamma radiation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration, sodium iodide I131 is absorbed rapidly from the upper gastrointestinal tract (90 in 60 minutes). The pharmacokinetics follow that of unlabelled iodide. After entering the blood stream, the iodide is distributed into the extra thyroidal compartment. From here it is predominantly taken up by the thyroid or excreted renally. In the thyroid, the trapped iodide is oxidized to iodine and organified. The sodiumiodide symporter (NIS) is responsible for the concentration of iodide in the thyroid. This active transport process concentrates iodide 20 to 40 times the plasma concentration under normal circumstances, and this may increase tenfold in the hyperthyroid state. NIS also mediates active iodide transport in other tissues, including salivary glands, nasolacrimal duct, lacrimal sac, gastric mucosa, lactating mammary gland, and the choroid plexus. The nonthyroidal iodide transporting tissues do not have the ability to organify accumulated iodide. Depending on renal and thyroid gland function, urinary excretion is 37 to 75 of the administered dose, fecal excretion is about 10, and excretion in sweat is almost negligible.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers to minimize the absorbed radiation dose to breast tissue, discontinue breastfeeding at least four weeks before sodium iodide I131 therapy. If administered in the postpartum period, the lactating mother should not breastfeed. (8.3) Pediatric Use safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. (8.4) Geriatric Use enhanced evaluation, dose selection and followup procedures may be necessary for geriatric patients due to underlying comorbidities, including renal dysfunction. (8.5) Renal Impairment may increase radiation exposure. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Sodium iodide I131 is excreted into human milk and may reach concentrations equal to or greater than concentrations in maternal plasma. To minimize the absorbed radiation dose to the breast tissue, breastfeeding and breastpumping should be discontinued for at least four weeks before administration of sodium iodide I131. Sodium iodide I131 is contraindicated in pregnancy if sodium iodide I131 is administered in the postpartum period, the lactating mother should not breastfeed the infant. Breastfeeding may resume with the birth of another child, if the mother does not receive sodium iodide I131 during that postpartum period. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Published reports suggest that the thyroid gland of pediatric patients is more sensitive to the effects of sodium iodide I131 however, it is unknown if the I131 doseresponse relationship is similar to that of adults. When considering the use of sodium iodide I131 in pediatric patients, the risks, particularly carcinogenic risks, and benefits of sodium iodide I131 must be carefully weighed against those of other possible treatments. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function and comorbid conditions, enhanced evaluation, doseselection consideration and followup may be necessary for elderly patients receiving sodium iodide I131 therapy, compared to younger patients see Use in Specific Populations (8.6).

Patients with renal impairment are subject to decreased excretion of sodium iodide I131 and increased radiation exposure. Evaluate renal function for therapeutic planning see Dosage and Administration (2.4). Sodium iodide I131 is dialyzable. Hemodialysis can be used to reduce total body radiation exposure., 8.6 Renal Impairment Sodium iodide I131 is eliminated predominantly through renal clearance.

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Radiationinduced thyroiditis may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism consider pretreatment with antithyroid medications. (5.1) Thyroid enlargement, including that due to thyroid stimulating hormone concomitant therapy, may obstruct structures in the neck. Evaluate patients at high risk. (5.2) Multiple nonthyroid radiation toxicities have been reported following sodium iodide I131 therapy, including increased risks for neoplasia, hematopoietic suppression, and fetal or reproductive toxicity. Individualize dosage, verify absence of pregnancy, monitor patients for toxicity, and advise patients on contraceptive use. (5.3, 5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Radiationinduced Thyroiditis Sodium iodide I131 may cause thyroiditis with gland enlargement and release of thyroid hormone, particularly when used to treat hyperthyroidism. The thyroiditis may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism, and may cause thyroid storm. When treating hyperthyroidism, consider pretreatment with antithyroid medication to help deplete the thyroid hormone content within the gland. Discontinue the antithyroid medication at least three days before administration of sodium iodide I131. Consider betablocker therapy before administration of sodium iodide I131 to minimize the risk of hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm. 5.2 Thyroidstimulating Hormone (TSH) and Thyroid Enlargement Enhanced TSH secretion, e.g., following discontinuation of antithyroid medications, or the administration of TSH to enhance sodium iodide I131 uptake, may cause thyroid enlargement and obstructive complications of the trachea, esophagus, or blood vessels in the neck. Evaluate patients at high risk of obstructive complications before preparative treatments known to cause thyroid enlargement. 5.3 Radiationinduced Toxicities Radiationinduced toxicities, including dosedependent fatalities, have been reported following sodium iodide I131 therapy. Postmarketing reports have identified an increased risk for neoplasia, as well as risks for hematopoietic suppression. Salivary and lacrimal gland toxicity is relatively common and may manifest as conjunctivitis, xerophthalmia, epiphora, sialadenitis and xerostomia see Adverse Reactions (6). 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash and hives have been reported following administration of sodium iodide I131. Sodium iodide I131 capsules may contain sodium bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergictype reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and lifethreatening or less severe asthmatic episodes. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. During the pretherapy assessment, question patients about a history of hypersensitivity to sulfite see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ). 5.5 Fetal Risk Transplacental passage of sodium iodide I131 can cause severe and possibly irreversible hypothyroidism in neonates see Contraindications (4). Females and Males of Childbearing Potential When planning sodium iodide I131 therapy for women of childbearing potential, obtain a pregnancy test and verify the absence of a pregnancy before initiating treatment. Advise women and men of childbearing potential to use two effective methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy for at least six months after sodium iodide I131 administration. Advise patients of the potential need to use two effective methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy for an even longer period of time (e.g., one year) if additional sodium iodide I131 therapy or radionuclide imaging is anticipated. 5.6 Transient Infertility Transient, doserelated impairment of testicular function has been reported after sodium iodide I131 therapy. Consider sperm banking for men who are anticipated to receive a high cumulative sodium iodide I131 dose (e.g., greater than 14 GBq). In females, transient ovarian failure has been observed after sodium iodide I131 therapy. 5.7 Radiation Exposure Risk to Other Individuals Unwanted radiation exposure can occur from handling and administration of radiopharmaceuticals or from contaminated waste products, including urine and feces. Follow safe administration instructions to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure to patients and health care workers see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ). Instruct patients on how to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure to others, especially family members following treatment. Review the most recent professional society guidelines and publications that describe the procedures for the safe use of sodium iodide I131 therapy to minimize radiation toxicity risks to patients, radiation exposure risks to other individuals, and environmental radiation contamination risks., 5.1 Radiationinduced Thyroiditis Sodium iodide I131 may cause thyroiditis with gland enlargement and release of thyroid hormone, particularly when used to treat hyperthyroidism. The thyroiditis may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism, and may cause thyroid storm. When treating hyperthyroidism, consider pretreatment with antithyroid medication to help deplete the thyroid hormone content within the gland. Discontinue the antithyroid medication at least three days before administration of sodium iodide I131. Consider betablocker therapy before administration of sodium iodide I131 to minimize the risk of hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm., 5.2 Thyroidstimulating Hormone (TSH) and Thyroid Enlargement Enhanced TSH secretion, e.g., following discontinuation of antithyroid medications, or the administration of TSH to enhance sodium iodide I131 uptake, may cause thyroid enlargement and obstructive complications of the trachea, esophagus, or blood vessels in the neck. Evaluate patients at high risk of obstructive complications before preparative treatments known to cause thyroid enlargement., 5.3 Radiationinduced Toxicities Radiationinduced toxicities, including dosedependent fatalities, have been reported following sodium iodide I131 therapy. Postmarketing reports have identified an increased risk for neoplasia, as well as risks for hematopoietic suppression. Salivary and lacrimal gland toxicity is relatively common and may manifest as conjunctivitis, xerophthalmia, epiphora, sialadenitis and xerostomia see Adverse Reactions (6)., 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash and hives have been reported following administration of sodium iodide I131. Sodium iodide I131 capsules may contain sodium bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergictype reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and lifethreatening or less severe asthmatic episodes. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. During the pretherapy assessment, question patients about a history of hypersensitivity to sulfite see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )., 5.5 Fetal Risk Transplacental passage of sodium iodide I131 can cause severe and possibly irreversible hypothyroidism in neonates see Contraindications (4). Females and Males of Childbearing Potential When planning sodium iodide I131 therapy for women of childbearing potential, obtain a pregnancy test and verify the absence of a pregnancy before initiating treatment.

<tr><td><i>laboratory_tests</i>:</td><td>Laboratory Tests Although oxycodone may crossreact with some drug urine tests, no available studies were found which determined the duration of detectability of oxycodone in urine drug screens. However, based on pharmacokinetic data, the approximate duration of detectability for a single dose of oxycodone is roughly estimated to be one to two days following drug exposure. Urine testing for opiates may be performed to determine illicit drug use and for medical reasons such as evaluation of patients with altered states of consciousness or monitoring efficacy of drug rehabilitation efforts. The preliminary identification of opiates in urine involves the use of an immunoassay screening and thinlayer chromatography (TLC). Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) may be utilized as a thirdstage identification step in the medical investigational sequence for opiate testing after immunoassay and TLC. The identities of 6keto opiates (e.g., oxycodone) can further be differentiated by the analysis of their methoximetrimethylsilyl (MOTMS) derivative.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Central Nervous System Oxycodone is a semisynthetic pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other pharmacological effects of oxycodone include anxiolysis, euphoria and feelings of relaxation. These effects are mediated by receptors (notably  and ) in the central nervous system for endogenous opioidlike compounds such as endorphins and enkephalins. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression through direct activity at respiratory centers in the brain stem and depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the center of the medulla. Acetaminophen is a nonopiate, nonsalicylate analgesic and antipyretic. The site and mechanism for the analgesic effect of acetaminophen has not been determined. The antipyretic effect of acetaminophen is accomplished through the inhibition of endogenous pyrogen action on the hypothalamic heatregulating centers., Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone reduces motility by increasing smooth muscle tone in the stomach and duodenum. In the small intestine, digestion of food is delayed by decreases in propulsive contractions. Other opioid effects include contraction of biliary tract smooth muscle, spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi, increased ureteral and bladder sphincter tone, and a reduction in uterine tone., Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce a release of histamine and may be associated with orthostatic hypotension, and other symptoms, such as pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating., Absorption and Distribution  The mean absolute oral bioavailability of oxycodone in cancer patients was reported to be about 87. Oxycodone has been shown to be 45 bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The volume of distribution after intravenous administration is 211.9  186.6 L. Absorption of acetaminophen is rapid and almost complete from the GI tract after oral administration. With overdosage, absorption is complete in 4 hours. Acetaminophen is relatively uniformly distributed throughout most body fluids. Binding of the drug to plasma proteins is variable only 20 to 50 may be bound at the concentrations encountered during acute intoxication., Metabolism and Elimination A high portion of oxycodone is Ndealkylated to noroxycodone during firstpass metabolism. Oxymorphone, is formed by the Odemethylation of oxycodone. The metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone is catalyzed by CYP2D6. Free and conjugated noroxycodone, free and conjugated oxycodone, and oxymorphone are excreted in human urine following a single oral dose of oxycodone. Approximately 8 to 14 of the dose is excreted as free oxycodone over 24 hours after administration. Following a single, oral dose of oxycodone, the mean  SD elimination halflife is 3.51  1.43 hours. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver via cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme. About 80 to 85 of the acetaminophen in the body is conjugated principally with glucuronic acid and to a lesser extent with sulfuric acid and cysteine. After hepatic conjugation, 90 to 100 of the drug is recovered in the urine within the first day. About 4 of acetaminophen is metabolized via cytochrome P450 oxidase to a toxic metabolite which is further detoxified by conjugation with glutathione, present in a fixed amount. It is believed that the toxic metabolite NAPQI (N acetylpbenzoquinoneimine, Nacetylimidoquinone) is responsible for liver necrosis. High doses of acetaminophen may deplete the glutathione stores so that inactivation of the toxic metabolite is decreased. At high doses, the capacity of metabolic pathways for conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid may be exceeded, resulting in increased metabolism of acetaminophen by alternate pathways., Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphinetype. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about misuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Administration of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should be closely monitored for the following potentially serious adverse reactions and complications, Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is a hazard with the use of oxycodone, one of the active ingredients in oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets, as with all opioid agonists. Elderly and debilitated patients are at particular risk for respiratory depression as are nontolerant patients given large initial doses of oxycodone or when oxycodone is given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with acute asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), cor pulmonale, or preexisting respiratory impairment. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative nonopioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. In case of respiratory depression, a reversal agent such as naloxone hydrochloride may be utilized (see OVERDOSAGE )., Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of worsening in patients with head injuries., Hypotensive Effect Oxycodone may cause severe hypotension particularly in individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs which compromise vasomotor tone such as phenothiazines. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphinetype, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients., Hepatotoxicity Precaution should be taken in patients with liver disease. Hepatotoxicity and severe hepatic failure occurred in chronic alcoholics following therapeutic doses., "Acute Abdominal Conditions  The administration of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets or other opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should be given with caution to patients with CNS depression, elderly or debilitated patients, patients with severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addisons disease, prostatic hypertrophy, urethral stricture, acute alcoholism, delirium tremens, kyphoscoliosis with respiratory depression, myxedema, and toxic psychosis. Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Following administration of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets, anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients with a known hypersensitivity to codeine, a compound with a structure similar to morphine and oxycodone. The frequency of this possible crosssensitivity is unknown.", Interactions with Other CNS Depressants Patients receiving other opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, centrallyacting antiemetics, sedativehypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may exhibit an additive CNS depression. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced., Interactions with Mixed AgonistAntagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone andor may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients., Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use Oxycodone and other morphinelike opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intraabdominal surgery with use of opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented., Use in PancreaticBiliary Tract Disease Oxycodone may cause spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like oxycodone may cause increases in the serum amylase level., Tolerance and Physical Dependence Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cessation of Therapy )., DrugDrug Interactions with Oxycodone Opioid analgesics may enhance the neuromuscularblocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increase in the degree of respiratory depression. Patients receiving CNS depressants such as other opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, centrallyacting antiemetics, sedativehypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may exhibit an additive CNS depression. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. The concurrent use of anticholinergics with opioids may produce paralytic ileus. Agonistantagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, naltrexone, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a pure opioid agonist such as oxycodone. These agonistantagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms., DrugDrug Interactions with Acetaminophen, Alcohol, ethyl  Hepatotoxicity has occurred in chronic alcoholics following various dose levels (moderate to excessive) of acetaminophen., Anticholinergics  The onset of acetaminophen effect may be delayed or decreased slightly, but the ultimate pharmacological effect is not significantly affected by anticholinergics., Oral Contraceptives  Increase in glucuronidation resulting in increased plasma clearance and a decreased halflife of acetaminophen., Charcoal (activated)  Reduces acetaminophen absorption when administered as soon as possible after overdose. Beta Blockers (Propanolol)  Propanolol appears to inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for the glucuronidation and oxidation of acetaminophen. Therefore, the pharmacologic effects of acetaminophen may be increased., Loop Diuretics  The effects of the loop diuretic may be decreased because acetaminophen may decrease renal prostaglandin excretion and decrease plasma renin activity., Lamotrigine  Serum lamotrigine concentrations may be reduced, producing a decrease in therapeutic effects., Probenecid  Probenecid may increase the therapeutic effectiveness of acetaminophen slightly., Zidovudine  The pharmacologic effects of zidovudine may be decreased because of enhanced nonhepatic or renal clearance of zidovudine., Carcinogenesis  Animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone and acetaminophen have not been performed., Mutagenesis  The combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen has not been evaluated for mutagenicity. Oxycodone alone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames), an in vitro chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes without metabolic activation and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation and in the mouse lymphoma assay with or without metabolic activation., Fertility  Animal studies to evaluate the effects of oxycodone on fertility have not been performed., Hepatic Impairment In a pharmacokinetic study of oxycodone in patients with endstage liver disease, oxycodone plasma clearance decreased and the elimination halflife increased. Care should be exercised when oxycodone is used in patients with hepatic impairment., Renal Impairment In a study of patients with end stage renal impairment, mean elimination halflife was prolonged in uremic patients due to increased volume of distribution and reduced clearance. Oxycodone should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment., Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Oxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression., Signs and Symptoms Serious overdose with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets is characterized by signs and symptoms of opioid and acetaminophen overdose. Oxycodone overdosage can be manifested by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate andor tidal volume, CheyneStokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, pupillary constriction (pupils may be dilated in the setting of hypoxia), and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur. In acute acetaminophen overdosage, dosedependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma and thrombocytopenia may also occur. In adults, hepatic toxicity has rarely been reported with acute overdoses of less than 10 grams and fatalities with less than 15 grams. Plasma acetaminophen levels  300 mcgmL at 4 hours postingestion were associated with hepatic damage in 90 of patients minimal hepatic damage is anticipated if plasma levels at 4 hours are  120 mcgmL or  30 mcgmL at 12 hours after ingestion. Importantly, young children seem to be more resistant than adults to the hepatotoxic effect of an acetaminophen overdose. Despite this, the measures outlined below should be initiated in any adult or child suspected of having ingested an acetaminophen overdose. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, diaphoresis and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours postingestion., Treatment Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote against respiratory depression which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to opioids including oxycodone. Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered (usual initial adult dose 0.4 mg to 2 mg) preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action of oxycodone may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including oxycodone, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use. Gastric emptying andor lavage may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug. This procedure is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage andor emesis, administration of activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than three hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to lavage and emesis. If an acetaminophen overdose is suspected, the stomach should be promptly emptied by lavage. A serum acetaminophen assay should be obtained as soon as possible, but no sooner than 4 hours following ingestion. Liver function studies should be obtained initially and repeated at 24hour intervals. The antidote Nacetylcysteine (NAC) should be administered as early as possible, preferably within 16 hours of the overdose ingestion, but in any case within 24 hours. As a guide to treatment of acute ingestion, the acetaminophen level can be plotted against time since ingestion on a nomogram (RumackMatthew). The upper toxic line on the nomogram is equivalent to 200 mcgmL at 4 hours while the lower line is equivalent to 50 mcgmL at 12 hours. If serum level is above the lower line, an entire course of Nacetylcysteine treatment should be instituted. NAC therapy should be withheld if the acetaminophen level is below the lower line. The toxicity of oxycodone and acetaminophen in combination is unknown., Cessation of Therapy In patients treated with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for more than a few weeks who no longer require therapy, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_abuse_and_dependence</i>:</td><td>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone is a muagonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is defined as an abnormal, compulsive use, use for nonmedical purposes of a substance despite physical, psychological, occupational or interpersonal difficulties resulting from such use, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Opioid addiction is relatively rare in patients with chronic pain but may be more common in individuals who have a past history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence. Pseudoaddiction refers to pain relief seeking behavior of patients whose pain is poorly managed. It is considered an iatrogenic effect of ineffective pain management. The health care provider must assess continuously the psychological and clinical condition of a pain patient in order to distinguish addiction from pseudoaddiction and thus, be able to treat the pain adequately. Physical dependence on a prescribed medication does not signify addiction. Physical dependence involves the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome when there is sudden reduction or cessation in drug use or if an opiate antagonist is administered. Physical dependence can be detected after a few days of opioid therapy. However, clinically significant physical dependence is only seen after several weeks of relatively high dosage therapy. In this case, abrupt discontinuation of the opioid may result in a withdrawal syndrome. If the discontinuation of opioids is therapeutically indicated, gradual tapering of the drug over a 2week period will prevent withdrawal symptoms. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome depends primarily on the daily dosage of the opioid, the duration of therapy and medical status of the individual. The withdrawal syndrome of oxycodone is similar to that of morphine. This syndrome is characterized by yawning, anxiety, increased heart rate and blood pressure, restlessness, nervousness, muscle aches, tremor, irritability, chills alternating with hot flashes, salivation, anorexia, severe sneezing, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, piloerection, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and insomnia, and pronounced weakness and depression. Drugseeking behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drugseeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). Doctor Shopping to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated infection. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Oxycodone, like other opioids, has been diverted for nonmedical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Like other opioid medications, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are subject to the Federal Controlled Substances Act. After chronic use, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should not be discontinued abruptly when it is thought that the patient has become physically dependent on oxycodone.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>Information for PatientsCaregivers The following information should be provided to patients receiving oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets by their physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver Patients should be aware that oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphinelike substance. Patients should be instructed to keep oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets in a secure place out of the reach of children. In the case of accidental ingestions, emergency medical care should be sought immediately. When oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Patients should be advised not to adjust the medication dose themselves. Instead, they must consult with their prescribing physician. Patients should be advised that oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may impair mental andor physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets with alcohol, opioid analgesics, tranquilizers, sedatives, or other CNS depressants unless under the recommendation and guidance of a physician. When coadministered with another CNS depressant, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets can cause dangerous additive central nervous system or respiratory depression, which can result in serious injury or death. The safe use of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets during pregnancy has not been established thus, women who are planning to become pregnant or are pregnant should consult with their physician before taking oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets. Nursing mothers should consult with their physicians about whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to nursing infants. Patients who are treated with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for more than a few weeks should be advised not to abruptly discontinue the medication. Patients should consult with their physician for a gradual discontinuation dose schedule to taper off the medication. Patients should be advised that oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>Precautions General As with all broadspectrum antibiotics, Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.Although Cefizox has not been shown to produce an alteration in renal function, renal status should be evaluated, especially in seriously ill patients receiving maximum dose therapy. As with any antibiotic, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation is essential appropriate measures should be taken if superinfection occurs.Cephalosporins may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.Prescribing Cefizox in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drugresistant bacteria. Drug Interactions Although the occurrence has not been reported with Cefizox, nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Longterm studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ceftizoxime have not been conducted. In an in vitro bacterial cell assay (i.e., Ames test), there was no evidence of mutagenicity at ceftizoxime concentrations of 0.0010.5 mcgplate. Ceftizoxime did not produce increases in micronuclei in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test when given to animals at doses up to 7500 mgkg, approximately six times greater than the maximum human daily dose on a mgM2 basis.Ceftizoxime had no effect on fertility when administered subcutaneously to rats at daily doses of up to 1000 mgkgday, approximately two times the maximum human daily dose on a mgM2 basis. Ceftizoxime produced no histological changes in the sexual organs of male and female dogs when given intravenously for thirteen weeks at a dose of 1000 mgkgday, approximately five times greater than the maximum human daily dose on a mgM2 basis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Cefizox. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human effects, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Safety of Cefizox use during labor and delivery has not been established. Nursing Mothers Cefizox is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Caution should be exercised when Cefizox is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients from birth to six months of age have not been established. In pediatric patients six months of age and older, treatment with Cefizox has been associated with transient elevated levels of eosinophils, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and CPK (creatine phosphokinase). The CPK elevation may be related to IM administration.The potential for the toxic effect in pediatric patients from chemicals that may leach from the singledose IV preparation in plastic has not been determined. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ceftizoxime did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Cefizox should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefizox is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed.

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>Indications and Usage Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the microorganisms listed below.Lower Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Klebsiella spp. Proteus mirabilis Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillinresistant strains Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinasexad and nonpenicillinaseproducing) Serratia spp. Enterobacter spp. Bacteroides spp. and Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae, but excluding enterococci.Urinary Tract Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinaseproducing) Escherichia coli Pseudomonas spp. including P.aeruginosa Proteus mirabilis P. vulgaris Providencia rettgeri (formerly Proteus rettgeri) and Morganella morganii (formerly Proteus morganii) Klebsiella spp. Serratia spp. including S. marcescens and Enterobacter spp.Gonorrhea including uncomplicated cervical and urethral gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.Pelvic Inflammatory Disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae. NOTE Ceftizoxime, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antixadchlamydial coverage should be added.IntraAbdominal Infections caused by Escherichia coli Staphylococcusepidermidis Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci) Enterobacter spp. Klebsiella spp. Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp.Septicemia caused by Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae (but excluding enterococci) Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinaseproducing) Escherichia coli Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis Klebsiella spp. and Serratia spp.Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinaseproducing) Staphylococcus epidermidis Escherichia coli Klebsiella spp. Streptococcus spp. including Streptococcus pyogenes (but excluding enterococci) Proteus mirabilis Serratia spp. Enterobacter spp. Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp.Bone and Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinaseproducing) Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci) Proteusmirabilis Bacteroides spp. and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp.Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Cefizox has also been used successfully in the treatment of a limited number of pediatric and adult cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.Cefizox has been effective in the treatment of seriously ill, compromised patients, including those who were debilitated, immunosuppressed, or neutropenic. Infections caused by aerobic gramnegative and by mixtures of organisms resistant to other cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or penicillins have responded to treatment with Cefizox.Because of the serious nature of some urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt.Susceptibility studies on specimens obtained prior to therapy should be used to determine the response of causative organisms to Cefizox. Therapy with Cefizox may be initiated pending results of the studies however, treatment should be adjusted according to study findings. In serious infections, Cefizox has been used concomitantly with aminoglycosides (see PRECAUTIONS). Before using Cefizox concomitantly with other antibiotics, the prescribing information for those agents should be reviewed for contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions. Renal function should be carefully monitored.To reduce the development of drugresistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefizox and other antibacterial drugs, Cefizox should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients from birth to six months of age have not been established. In pediatric patients six months of age and older, treatment with Cefizox has been associated with transient elevated levels of eosinophils, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and CPK (creatine phosphokinase). The CPK elevation may be related to IM administration.The potential for the toxic effect in pediatric patients from chemicals that may leach from the singledose IV preparation in plastic has not been determined.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>Dosage and Administration Note Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) in the ADDVantage vial is intended for intravenous infusion only after dilution with the appropriate volume of ADDVantage diluent solution.The usual adult dosage is 1 or 2 grams of Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) every 8 to 12 hours. Proper dosage and route of administration should be determined by the condition of the patient, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms.General Guidelines for Dosage of Cefizox Type ofInfectionDaily Dose(Grams)Frequencyand Route Uncomplicated Urinary Tract1500 mg q12h IM or IV Other Sites231 gram q812h IM or IV Severe or Refractory361 gram q8h IM or IV 2 grams q812h IMWhen administering 2 gram IM doses, the dose should be divided and given in different large muscle masses. or IV PID If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antixadchlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftizoxime has no activity against this organism.62 grams q8h IV LifeThreatening In lifethreatening infections, dosages up to 2 grams every 4 hours have been given.91234 grams q8h IV Because of the serious nature of urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt. A single, 1 gram IM dose is the usual dose for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.The IV route may be preferable for patients with bacterial septicemia, localized parenchymal abscesses (such as intraxadabdominal abscess), peritonitis, or other severe or lifethreatening infections.In those with normal renal function, the IV dosage for such infections is 2 to 12 grams of Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) daily. In conditions such as bacterial septicemia, 6 to 12 gramsday may be given initially by the IV route for several days, and the dosage may then be gradually reduced according to clinical response and laboratory findings.Pediatric Dosage Schedule Unit DoseFrequency Pediatric patients6 months or older50 mgkgq68h Dosage may be increased to a total daily dose of 200 mgkg (not to exceed the maximum adult dose for serious infection). Impaired Renal Function Modification of Cefizox dosage is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. Following an initial loading dose of 500 mg1 gram IM or IV, the maintenance dosing schedule shown below should be followed. Further dosing should be determined by therapeutic monitoring, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms.When only the serum creatinine level is available, creatinine clearance may be calculated from the following formula. The serum creatinine level should represent current renal function at the steady state.Males Clcr Weight (kg) x (140 xad age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg100 mL) Females are 0.85 of the calculated clearance values for males.In patients undergoing hemodialysis, no additional supplemental dosing is required following hemodialysis however, dosing should be timed so that the patient receives the dose (according to the table below) at the end of the dialysis.Dosage in Adults with Reduced Renal Function CreatinineClearancemLminRenal FunctionLess SevereInfectionsLifeThreateningInfections 7950MildImpairment500 mg q8h0.751.5 gramsq8h 495Moderate to severeimpairment250500 mgq12h0.51 gramq12h 40DialysisPatients500 mg q48hor250 mg q24h0.51 gramq48hor0.5 gram q24h Reconstitution Cefizox in the ADDVantage vial is intended for use with ADDVantage diluent containers only, available in 50 mL and 100 mL sizes of Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9 and Dextrose Injection 5.Ordinarily, the ADDVantage vials should be reconstituted only when it is certain that the patient is ready to receive the drug. However, reconstitued Cefizox is stable for 24 hours at room temperature or 96 hours under refrigeration 5C (41F).Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. To Open ADDVantage  Diluent Containers Peel overwrap at corner and remove solution container. Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety. The opacity will diminish gradually. To Assemble Vial and Flexible Diluent Container (Use Aseptic Technique) 1. Remove the protective covers from the top of the vial and the vial port on the diluent container as follows a. To remove the breakaway vial cap, swing the pull ring over the top of the vial and pull down far enough to start the opening (SEE FIGURE 1.), then pull straight up to remove the cap. (SEE FIGURE 2.) NOTE Once the breakaway cap has been removed, do not access vial with syringe.b. To remove the vial port cover, grasp the tab on the pull ring, pull up to break the three tie strings, then pull further to remove the cover. (SEE FIGURE 3.) 2. Screw the vial into the vial port until it will go no further. THE VIAL MUST BE SCREWED IN TIGHTLY TO ASSURE A SEAL. This occurs approximately  turn (180) after the first audible click. (SEE FIGURE 4.) The clicking sound does not assure a seal the vial must be turned as far as it will go. NOTE Once vial is sealed, do not attempt to remove. (SEE FIGURE 4.)3. Recheck the vial to assure that it is tight by trying to turn it further in the direction of assembly.4. Label appropriately. To Prepare Admixture Squeeze the bottom of the diluent container gently to inflate the portion of the container surrounding the end of the drug vial.With the other hand, push the drug vial down into the container telescoping the walls of the container. Grasp the inner cap of the vial through the walls of the container. (SEE FIGURE 5.)Pull the inner cap from the drug vial. (SEE FIGURE 6.) Verify that the rubber stopper has been pulled out, allowing the diluent to enter the drug vial and thoroughly dissolve the powder.Mix container contents thoroughly by inverting several times, and use within the specified time. Preparation for Administration (Use Aseptic Technique) Confirm the activation and admixture of vial contents.Check for leaks by squeezing container firmly. If leaks are found, discard unit as sterility may be impaired.Close flow control clamp of administration set.Remove cover from outlet port at bottom of container.Insert piercing pin of administration set into port with a twisting motion until the pin is firmly seated. NOTE See full directions on administration set carton.Lift the free end of the hanger loop on the bottom of the vial, breaking the two tie strings. Bend the loop outward to lock it in the upright position, then suspend container from hanger. Squeeze and release drip chamber to establish proper fluid level in chamber.Open flow control clamp and clear air from set. Close clamp.Attach set to venipuncture device. If device is not indwelling, prime and make venipuncture. Regulate rate of administration with flow control clamp.WARNING Do not use flexible container in series connections.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Cefizox should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefizox is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefizox or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>General As with all broadspectrum antibiotics, Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.Although Cefizox has not been shown to produce an alteration in renal function, renal status should be evaluated, especially in seriously ill patients receiving maximum dose therapy. As with any antibiotic, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation is essential appropriate measures should be taken if superinfection occurs.Cephalosporins may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.Prescribing Cefizox in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drugresistant bacteria.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>Description Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) is a sterile, semisynthetic, broadspectrum, betalactamase resistant cephalosporin antibiotic for parenteral (IV, IM) administration. It is the sodium salt of 6Rxad6a,7(Z)7(2,3dihydro2imino4 thiazolyl) (methoxyimino) acetyl amino8oxo5thia1azabicyclo 4.2.0 oct2ene2carboxylic acid. Its sodium content is approximately 60 mg (2.6 mEq) per gram of ceftizoxime activity.It has the following structural formulaC13H12N5NaO5S2 405.38 Ceftizoxime for injection, USP is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder.Cefizox is supplied in ADDvantage vials as ceftizoxime sodium equivalent to 1 gram or 2 grams ceftizoxime.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>Warnings BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFIZOX IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFIZOX, OTHER CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLINxadSENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETALACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10 OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFIZOX OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, IV FLUIDS, IV ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including ceftizoxime, and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibioticassociated colitis.After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, appropriate therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone.

This provides a high urinary concentration. Concentrations greater than 6000 gmL have been achieved in the urine by 2 hours after a 1 gram dose of Cefizox intravenously. Probenecid slows tubular secretion and produces even higher serum levels, increasing the duration of measurable serum concentrations.Cefizox achieves therapeutic levels in various body fluids, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (in patients with inflamed meninges), bile, surgical wound fluid, pleural fluid, aqueous humor, ascitic fluid, peritoneal fluid, prostatic fluid and saliva, and in the following body tissues heart, gallbladder, bone, biliary, peritoneal, prostatic, and uterine.In clinical experience to date, no disulfiramlike reactions have been reported with Cefizox. Microbiology The bactericidal action of Ceftizoxime results from inhibition of cellwall synthesis. Ceftizoxime is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of betalactamases (penicillinase and cephalosporinase), including Richmond types I, II, III, TEM, and IV, produced by both aerobic and anaerobic grampositive and gramnegative organisms. Ceftizoxime has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section Aerobic GramPositive Microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase producing strains)NOTE Methicillinxadresistant staphylococci are resistant to cephalosporins, including ceftizoxime.Staphylococcus epidermidis (including penicillinase producing strains)Streptococcus agalactiaeStreptococcus pneumoniaeStreptococcus pyogenesNOTE A streptococcal isolate that is susceptible to penicillin can be considered susceptible to ceftizoxime 4. NOTE Ceftizoxime is usually inactive against most strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Aerobic GramNegative Microorganisms Enterobacter spp.Escherichia coliHaemophilus influenzae (including ampicillinxadresistant strains)Klebsiella pneumoniaeMorganella morganiiNeisseria gonorrhoeaeProteus mirabilisProteus vulgarisProvidencia rettgeriPseudomonas aeruginosaSerratia marcescens Anaerobic Microorganisms Bacteroides spp.Peptococcus spp.Peptostreptococcus spp. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for ceftizoxime. However, the safety and effectiveness of ceftizoxime in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials. Aerobic GramNegative Microorganisms Aeromonas hydrophilaCitrobacter spp.MoraxellacatarrhalisNeisseria meningitidisProvidencia stuartii Susceptibility Testing Methods Dilution techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ceftizoxime powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria For testing nonfastidious aerobic microorganisms other than Haemophilus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae MIC (gmL)Interpretation 8Susceptible (S) 1632Intermediate (I) 64Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus spp. These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing with Haemophilus spp. using Haemophilus Test Medium.2 MIC (gmL)Interpretation The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any category other than susceptible. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a nonsusceptible category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing. 2Susceptible (S) For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae These interpretative standards are applicable only to agar dilution susceptibility testing using GC agar base and 1 defined growth supplements. MIC (gmL)Interpretation 0.5Susceptible (S) A report of Susceptible indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of Intermediate indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone, which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable, other therapy should be selected.Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard ceftizoxime powder should provide the following MIC values MicroorganismMIC(gmL) Escherichia coli ATCC 259220.030.12 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 492470.060.5 Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 492260.0080.03 Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 278531664 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2921328 Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30g ceftizoxime to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to ceftizoxime.Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard singledisk susceptibility test with a 30g ceftizoxime disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria Zone diameter interpretative standard for testing nonfastidious aerobic microorganisms other than Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Zone Diameter (mm)Interpretation  20Susceptible (S) 1519Intermediate (I)  14Resistant (R) Zone diameter interpretative standard for testing Haemophilus spp. These zone diameter standards are applicable only to susceptibility testing with Haemophilus spp. using Haemophilus Test Medium.3 Zone Diameter (mm) InterpretationThe current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any category other than susceptible. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a nonsusceptible category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.  26Susceptible (S) Zone diameter interpretative standard for testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae. These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using GC agar base and 1 defined growth supplements incubated at 5 CO2. Zone Diameter (mm)Interpretation  38Susceptible (S) Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for ceftizoxime.As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30g ceftizoxime disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains MicroorganismZone Diameter (mm) Escherichia coli ATCC 259223036 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 492472939 Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 492264251 Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 278531217 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 259232735 Anaerobic Techniques For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to ceftizoxime as MICs can be determined by standardized test methods. Agar dilution results can vary widely when using ceftizoxime. It is recommended that broth microdilution method be used when possible.3 The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria MIC(gmL) Broth dilutionAgar dilutionInterpretation  16 32Susceptible (S) 3264Intermediate (I)  64 128Resistant (R) Interpretation is identical to that described in Susceptibility Testing Dilution Techniques.As with other susceptibility techniques, the use of laboratory control microorganisms is required to control the technical aspects of the laboratory standardized procedures.

Ceftizoxime achieves high levels in the urine (greater than 6000 mcgmL at 2 hours with1 gram IV) and, therefore, the following zone sizes should be used when testing ceftizoxime for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonasaeruginosa.Susceptible organisms produce zones of 20 mm or greater, indicating that thetest organism is likely to respond to therapy.Organisms that produce zones of 11 to 19 mm are expected to be susceptiblewhen the infection is confined to the urinary tract (in which high antibiotic levelsare attained).

Isoniazid should be used as a treatment for active tuberculosis during pregnancy because the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation made at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction. If isoniazid therapy must be reinstituted, the drug should be given only after symp toms have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent hypersensitivity reaction. Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following Daily users of alcohol. Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of  isoniazid hepatitis. Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction. Age  35. Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication. History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid. Existence of peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy. Pregnancy. Injection drug use. Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the postpartum period. HIV seropositive patients. Laboratory Tests Because there is a higher frequency of isoniazid associated hepatitis among certain patient groups, including Age  35, daily users of alcohol, chronic liver disease, injection drug use and women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the postpartum period, transaminase measurements should be obtained prior to starting and monthly during preventative therapy, or more frequently as needed. If any of the values exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, isoniazid should be temporarily discontinued and consideration given to restarting therapy. Drug Interactions Food Isoniazid should not be administered with food. Studies have shown that the bioavailability of isoniazid is reduced significantly when administered with food. Acetaminophen A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving isoniazid. It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between isoniazid and acetaminophen and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed. However, current evidence suggests that isoniazid does induce P450IIE1, a mixedfunction oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites, in the liver. Furthermore it has been proposed that isoniazid resulted in induction of P450IIE1 in the patients liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested acetaminophen being converted to the toxic metabolites. Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with isoniazid potentiates acetaminophen heaptoxicity in rats 1,2. Carbamazepine Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels. Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isonia zid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and ap propriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made3. Ketoconazole Potential interaction of ketoconazole and isoniazid may exist. When ketoconazole is given in combination with isoniazid and rifampin the AUC of ketoconazole is decreased by as much as 88 after 5 months of concurrent isoniazid and rifampin therapy 4. Phenytoin Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin. To avoid phenytoin intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made5,6. Theophylline A recent study has shown that concomitant administration of isoniazid and theophylline may cause elevated plasma levels of theophylline, and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of isoniazid. Since the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow, theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made7. Valproate A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of valproate when coadministered with isoniazid. Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isonia zid and valproate are coadministered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made5. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Isoniazid has been shown to induce pulmonary tumors in a number of strains of mice. Isoniazid has not been shown to be carcinogenic in humans. (Note a diagnosis of mesothelioma in a child with prenatal exposure to isoniazid and no other apparent risk factors has been reported).

Nonteratogenic Effects Since isoniazid is known to cross the placenta barrier, neonates of isoniazidtreated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects. Nursing Mothers The small concentrations of isoniazid in breast milk do not produce toxicity in the nursing newborn therefore, breastfeeding should not be discouraged. However, because levels of isoniazid are so low in breast milk, they can not be relied upon for prophylaxis or therapy of nursing infants.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE Isoniazid is recommended for all forms of tuberculos in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant antituberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Singledrug treatment of active tuberculos with isoniazid, or any other medication, is inadequate therapy. Isoniazid is recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis) 1. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection ( 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy. 2. Close contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis ( 5 mm). In addition, tuberculinnegative ( 5mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of in fectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive ( 5 mm), therapy should be continued. 3. Recent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test ( 10 mm increase within a 2year period for those  35 years old  15 mm increase for those  35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a  10 mm skin test are included in this category. 4. Persons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis ( 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. 5. Intravenous drug users known to be HIVseronegative ( 10 mm). 6. Persons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis ( 10 mm) silicosis diabetes mellitus prolonged therapy with adrenocorti costeroids immunosuppressive therapy some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkins disease endstage renal disease clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic under nutrition (including intestinal bypass surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state (with or without weight loss), chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. Additionally, in the absence of any of the above risk factors, persons under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are also appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they are a member of any of the following highincidence groups Foreignborn persons from highprevalence countries who never received BCG vaccine. Medically under served lowincome populations, including highrisk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Residents of facilities for longterm care (e.g., correctional institutions, nursing homes, and mental institutions). Children who are less than 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have  10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test. Finally, persons under the age of 35 who a) have none of the above risk factors (16) b) belong to none of the highincidence groups and c) have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more, are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy. The risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactors over the age of 35. However, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above (16) and on an individual basis insituations where there is likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Repackaged By  Aidarex Pharmaceuticals LLC, Corona, CA 92880 Warning Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid therapy has been re ported and may occur or may develop even after many months of treatment. The risk of developing hepatitis is age related. Approximate case rates by age are less than 1 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 2034 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 3549 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 5064 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age. The risk of hepatitis is increased with daily consumption of alcohol. Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazidrelated hepatitis is not available however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study in volving 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 deaths among 174 cases of hepatitis. Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals. For persons 35 and older, in addition to monthly symptom reviews, hepatic enzymes (specifically, AST and ALT (formerly SGOT and SGPT, respectively)) should be measured prior to starting isoniazid therapy and periodically throughout treatment. Isoniazidassociated hepatitis usually occurs during the first three months of treatment. Usually, enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs. Other factors associated with an increased risk of hepatitis include daily use of alcohol, chronic liver disease and injection drug use. A recent report suggests an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid among women, particularly black and Hispanic women. The risk may also be increased during the post partum period. More careful monitoring should be considered in these groups, possibly including more frequent laboratory monitoring. If abnor malities of liver function exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontin uation of isoniazid should be strongly considered. Liver function tests are not a substitute for a clinical evaluation at monthly intervals or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions occurring between regularly scheduled evaluations. Patients should be instructed to immediately report signs or symptoms consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects. These include any of the following unexplained anorexia, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever of greater than 3 days duration andor abdominal tenderness, especially right upper quadrant discomfort. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of liver damage. Patients with tuberculosis who have hepatitis attributed to isoniazid should be given appro priate treatment with alternative drugs. If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinsti tuted only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immedi ately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement. Preventive treatment should be deferred in persons with acute hepatic diseases.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>microbiology</i>:</td><td>Microbiology Two standardized in vitro susceptibility methods are available for testing isoniazid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. The agar proportion method (CDC or NCCLS M24P) utilizes middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at two final concentrations, 0.2 and 0.1 mcgmL. MIC99 values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures. Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug  1 of the control indicates resistance. The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcgmL of isoniazid. Strict adherence to the manufacturers instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with an MIC99  0.2 mcgmL are considered to be susceptible to isoniazid. Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods discussed above cannot be compared unless equivalent drug concentrations are evaluated. The clinical relevance of in vitro susceptibility for mycobacterium species other than M. tuberculos is using either the BACTEC or the proportion method has not been determined.</td></tr>

It is doserelated, occurs most often in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuritis (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics), and is usually preceded by paresthesias of the feet and hands. The incidence is higher in "slow inactivators". Other neurotoxic effects, which are uncommon with conventional doses, are convulsions, toxic encephalopathy, optic neuritis and atrophy, memory impairment, and toxic psychosis. Hepatic Reactions See boxed warning. Elevated serum transaminase (SGOT SGPT), bilirubinemia, bilirubinuria, jaundice, and occasionally severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis. The common prodromal symp toms of hepatitis are anorexia, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, fatigue, malaise, and weakness. Mild hepatic dysfunction, evidenced by mild and transient elevation of serum transaminase levels occurs in 10 to 20 percent of patients taking isoniazid. This abnormality usually appears in the first 1 to 3 months of treatment but can occur at any time during therapy. In most instances, enzyme levels return to normal, and generally, there is no necessity to discontinue medication during the period of mild serum transaminase elevation. In occasional instances, progressive liver damage occurs, with accompanying symptoms. If the SGOT value exceeds three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of the isoniazid should be strongly considered. The frequency of progres sive liver damage increases with age. It is rare in persons under 20, but occurs in up to 2.3 percent of those over 50 years of age. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, and epigastric distress. Hematologic Reactions Agranulocytosis hemolytic, sideroblastic, or aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia. Hypersensitivity Reactions Fever, skin eruptions (morbilliform, maculopapular, purpuric, or exfoliative), lymphadenopathy, and vasculitis. Metabolic and Endocrine Reactions Pyridoxine deficiency, pellagra, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and gynecomastia. Miscellaneous Reactions Rheumatic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosuslike syndrome.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>General All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation made at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction. If isoniazid therapy must be reinstituted, the drug should be given only after symp toms have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent hypersensitivity reaction. Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following Daily users of alcohol. Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of  isoniazid hepatitis. Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction. Age  35. Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication. History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (See also INDICATIONS0.)  NOTE  For preventive therapy of tuberculous infection and treatment of tuberculosis, it is recommended that physicians be familiar with the following publications (1) the recommen dations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, published in the MMWR vol 42 RR4, 1993 and (2) Treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine vol 149 13591374, 1994. For Treatment of Tuberculosis Isoniazid is used in conjunction with other effective antituberculosis agents. Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organisms initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible. Usual Oral Dosage (depending on the regimen used) Adults 5 mgkg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose or 15 mgkg up to 900 mgday, two or three timesweek Children 10  15 mgkg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose or 2040 mgkg up to 900 mgday, two or three timesweek Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Without HIV Infection There are 3 regimen options for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in children and adults Option 1 Daily isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 16 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin daily or 2 to 3 times weekly. Ethambutol or streptomycin should be added to the initial regimen until sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin is demonstrated. The addition of a fourth drug is optional if the relative prevalence of isoniazidresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the community is less than or equal to four percent. Option 2 Daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin or ethambutol for 2 weeks followed by twice weekly administration of the same drugs for 6 weeks, subsequently twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin for 16 weeks. Option 3 Three times weekly with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin for 6 months.  All regimen given twice weekly or 3 times weekly should be administered by directly observed therapy (see also Directly Observed Therapy). The above treatment guidelines apply only when the disease is caused by organisms that are sus ceptible to the standard antituberculous agents. Because of the impact of resistance to isoniazid and rifampin on the response to therapy, it is essential that physicians initiating therapy for tu berculosis be familiar with the prevalence of drug resistance in their communities. It is suggested that ethambutol not be used in children whose visual acuity cannot be monitored. Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis and HIV Infection The response of the immunologically impaired host to treatment may not be as satisfactory as that of a person with normal host responsiveness. For this reason, therapeutic decisions for the impaired host must be individualized. Since patients coinfected with HIV may have problems with malabsorption, screening of antimycobacterial drug levels, especially in patients with ad vanced HIV disease, may be necessary to prevent the emergence of MDRTB. Patients with Extra Pulmonary Tuberculosis The basic principles that underlie the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis also apply to Extra pulmonary forms of the disease. Although there have not been the same kinds of carefully conducted controlled trials of treatment of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis as for pulmonary disease, increasing clinical experience indicates that a 6 to 9 month shortcourse regimen is effective. Because of the insufficient data, military tuberculosis, bonejoint tuberculosis, and tuberculous meningitis in infants and children should receive 12 month therapy. Bacteriologic evaluation of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis may be limited by the relative in accessibility of the sites of disease. Thus, response to treatment often must be judged on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings. The use of adjunctive therapies such as surgery and corticosteroids is more commonly required in Extra pulmonary tuberculosis than in pulmonary disease. Surgery may be necessary to obtain specimens for diagnosis and to treat such processes as constrictive pericarditis and spinal cord compression from Potts Disease. Corticosteroids have been shown to be of benefit in preventing cardiac constriction from tuberculous pericarditis and in decreasing the neurologic sequelae of all stages of tuberculosis meningitis, especially when administered early in the course of the disease. Pregnant Women with Tuberculosis The options listed above must be adjusted for the pregnant patient. Streptomycin interferes with in utero development of the ear and may cause congenital deafness. Routine use of pyrazinamide is also not recommended in pregnancy because of inadequate teratogenicity data. The initial treatment regimen should consist of isoniazid and rifampin. Ethambutol should be included unless primary isoniazid resistance is unlikely (isoniazid resistance rate documented to be less than 4). Treatment of Patients with MultiDrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) Multipledrug resistant tuberculosis (i.e., resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) presents difficult treatment problems. Treatment must be individualized and based on susceptibility studies. In such cases, consultation with an expert in tuberculosis is recommended. Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) A major cause of drugresistant tuberculosis is patient noncompliance with treatment. The use of DOT can help assure patient compliance with drug therapy. DOT is the observation of the pa tient by a health care provider or other responsible person as the patient ingests antituberculosis medications. DOT can be achieved with daily, twice weekly or thrice weekly regimens, and is recommended for all patients. For Preventative Therapy of Tuberculosis Before isoniazid preventive therapy is initiated, bacteriologically positive or radiographically progressive tuberculosis must be excluded. Appropriate evaluations should be performed if Extra pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected. Adults over 30 Kg 300 mg per day in a single dose. Infants and Children 10 mgkg (up to 300 mg daily) in a single dose. In situations where adherence with daily preventative therapy cannot be assured, 2030 mgkg (not to exceed 900 mg) twice weekly under the direct observation of a health care worker at the time of admin istration8. Continuous administration of isoniazid for a sufficient period is an essential part of the regimen because relapse rates are higher if chemotherapy is stopped prematurely. In the treatment of tu berculosis, resistant organisms may multiply and the emergence of resistant organisms during the treatment may necessitate a change in the regimen. For following patient compliance the PottsCozart test9, a simple colorimetric6 method of checking for isoniazid in the urine, is a useful tool for assuring patient compliance, which is essential for effective tuberculosis control. Additionally, isoniazid test strips are also available to check patient compliance. Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B6) is recommended in malnourished and in those predisposed to neuropathy (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Within 1 to 2 hours after oral administration, isoniazid produces peak blood levels which decline to 50 percent or less within 6 hours. It diffuses readily into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic fluids), tissues, organs, and excreta (saliva, sputum, and feces). The drug also passes through the placental barrier and into milk in concentrations comparable to those in the plasma. From 50 to 70 percent of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine within 24 hours. Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. Approximately 50 percent of Blacks and Caucasians are "slow inacti vators", and the rest are "rapid inactivators" the majority of Eskimos and Orientals are" rapid inactivators." The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid. However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood levels of the drug and, thus, to an increase in toxic reactions. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency is sometimes observed in adults with high doses of isoniazid and is considered probably due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase. Mechanism of Action Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacteri al cell wall. At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intra cellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. Isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli develop rapidly when isoniazid monotherapy is administered. Microbiology Two standardized in vitro susceptibility methods are available for testing isoniazid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. The agar proportion method (CDC or NCCLS M24P) utilizes middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at two final concentrations, 0.2 and 0.1 mcgmL. MIC99 values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures. Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug  1 of the control indicates resistance. The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcgmL of isoniazid. Strict adherence to the manufacturers instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with an MIC99  0.2 mcgmL are considered to be susceptible to isoniazid. Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods discussed above cannot be compared unless equivalent drug concentrations are evaluated. The clinical relevance of in vitro susceptibility for mycobacterium species other than M. tuberculos is using either the BACTEC or the proportion method has not been determined.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>Warning Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid therapy has been re ported and may occur or may develop even after many months of treatment. The risk of developing hepatitis is age related. Approximate case rates by age are less than 1 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 2034 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 3549 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 5064 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age. The risk of hepatitis is increased with daily consumption of alcohol. Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazidrelated hepatitis is not available however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study in volving 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 deaths among 174 cases of hepatitis. Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals. For persons 35 and older, in addition to monthly symptom reviews, hepatic enzymes (specifically, AST and ALT (formerly SGOT and SGPT, respectively)) should be measured prior to starting isoniazid therapy and periodically throughout treatment. Isoniazidassociated hepatitis usually occurs during the first three months of treatment. Usually, enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs. Other factors associated with an increased risk of hepatitis include daily use of alcohol, chronic liver disease and injection drug use. A recent report suggests an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid among women, particularly black and Hispanic women. The risk may also be increased during the post partum period. More careful monitoring should be considered in these groups, possibly including more frequent laboratory monitoring. If abnor malities of liver function exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontin uation of isoniazid should be strongly considered. Liver function tests are not a substitute for a clinical evaluation at monthly intervals or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions occurring between regularly scheduled evaluations. Patients should be instructed to immediately report signs or symptoms consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects. These include any of the following unexplained anorexia, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever of greater than 3 days duration andor abdominal tenderness, especially right upper quadrant discomfort. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of liver damage. Patients with tuberculosis who have hepatitis attributed to isoniazid should be given appro priate treatment with alternative drugs. If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinsti tuted only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immedi ately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement. Preventive treatment should be deferred in persons with acute hepatic diseases.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms Isoniazid overdosage produces signs and symptoms within 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion. Nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, dizziness, slurring of speech, blurring of vision, and visual hallucinations (including bright colors and strange designs) are among the early manifestations. With marked overdosage, respiratory distress and CNS depression, progressing rapidly from stupor to profound coma, are to be expected, along with severe, intractable seizures. Severe metabolic acidosis, acetonuria, and hyperglycemia are typical laboratory findings. Treatment Untreated or inadequately treated cases of gross isoniazid overdosage, 80 mgkg  150 mgkg, can cause neurotoxicity6 and terminate fatally, but good response has been reported in most patients brought under adequate treatment within the first few hours after drug ingestion. For the Asymptomatic Patient Absorption of drugs from the GI tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal. Gastric emptying should also be employed in the asymptomatic patient. Safeguard the patients airway when employing these procedures. Patients who acutely ingest  80 mgkg should be treated with intravenous pyridoxine on a gram per gram basis equal to the isoniazid dose. If an unknown amount of isoniazid is ingested, consider an initial dose of 5 grams of pyridoxine given over 30 to 60 minutes in adults, or 80 mgkg of pyridoxine in children. For the Symptomatic Patient Ensure adequate ventilation, support cardiac output, and protect the airway while treating seizures and attempting to limit absorption. If the dose of isoniazid is known, the patient should be treated initially with a slow intravenous bolus of pyridoxine, over 3 to 5 minutes, on a gram per gram basis, equal to the isoniazid dose. If the quantity of isoniazid ingestion is unknown, then consider an initial intravenous bolus of pyridoxine of 5 grams in the adult or 80 mgkg in the child. If seizures continue, the dosage of pyridoxine may be repeated. It would be rare that more than 10 grams of pyridoxine would need to be given. The maximum safe dose for pyridoxine in isoniazid intoxication is not known. If the patient does not respond to pyridoxine, diazepam may be ad ministered. Phenytoin should be used cautiously, because isoniazid interferes with the metabo lism of phenytoin. General Obtain blood samples for immediate determination of gases, electrolytes, BUN, glucose, etc. type and crossmatch blood in preparation for possible hemodialysis. Rapid Control of Metabolic Acidosis Patients with this degree of INH intoxication are likely to have hypoventilation. The ad ministration of sodium bicarbonate under these circumstances can cause exacerbation of hypercarbia. Ventilation must be monitored carefully, by measuring blood carbon dioxide levels, and supported mechanically, if there is respiratory insufficiency. Dialysis Both peritoneal and hemodialysis have been used in the management of isoniazid overdosage. These procedures are probably not required if control of seizures and acidosis is achieved with pyridoxine, diazepam and bicarbonate. Along with measures based on initial and repeated determination of blood gases and other laboratory tests as needed, utilize meticulous respiratory and other intensive care to protect against hypoxia, hypotension, aspiration, pneumonitis, etc.</td></tr>

Isoniazid should be used as a treatment for active tuberculosis during pregnancy because the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The benefit of preventative therapy also should be weighed against a possible risk to the fetus. Preventive therapy generally should be started after delivery to prevent putting the fetus at risk of exposure the low levels of isoniazid in breast milk do not threaten the neonate. Since isoniazid is known to cross the placenta barrier, neonates of isoniazid treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>SPL UNCLASSIFIED Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have saltretaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their potent antiinflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the bodys immune responses to diverse stimuli.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (See ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic Reactions ). Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during and after the stressful situation. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients. Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamicpituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for corticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids and may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for up to 12 months after discontinuation of therapy therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. If the patient is receiving steroids already, dosage may have to be increased. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. General Patients who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infection with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic) in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents that affect cellular immunity, humoral immunity, or neutrophil function.1 These infections may be mild, but may be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases.2 Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of current infection. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections unless they are needed to control lifethreatening drug reactions. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (See PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions  Amphotericin B Injection and PotassiumDepleting Agents). Special Pathogens Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Amoeba, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma. It is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or any patient with unexplained diarrhea. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroidinduced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia. Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral malaria. Tuberculosis The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines may be diminished and cannot be predicted. Indicated immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids as replacement therapy (e.g., for Addisons disease). Viral Infections Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease andor prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Ophthalmic Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Gastric irritation may be reduced if taken before, during, or immediately after meals or with food or milk. The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocorticoid activity the least when given at the time of maximal activity (am) for single dose administration. Therefore, it is recommended that prednisone be administered in the morning prior to 9 am and when large doses are given, administration of antacids between meals to help prevent peptic ulcers. Multiple dose therapy should be evenly distributed in evenly spaced intervals throughout the day. Dietary salt restriction may be advisable in patients. Do not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your doctor. Avoid abrupt withdraw of therapy. The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small increments at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patients individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment in this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patients condition. If after longterm therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring longterm pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitaryadrenal suppression, the cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises (a) the antiinflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for reestablishment of more nearly normal hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) activity on the offsteroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushings disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during longterm pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1 14 to 1 12 days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy 1. Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of alternate day therapy should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2. Alternate day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom longterm pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate day therapy. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available (a) change to alternate day therapy and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4. Because of the advantages of alternate day therapy, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on alternate day therapy may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6. The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7. In using alternate day therapy it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of alternate day therapy will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flareup in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the offsteroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8. In the event of an acute flareup of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be reinstituted. 9. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by alternate day therapy, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefitrisk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a riskbenefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Kaposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement. As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency. Druginduced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for up to 12 months after discontinuation of therapy following large doses for prolonged periods therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt andor a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism. Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of osteoporosis at any age. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy. Inclusion of therapy for osteoporosis prevention or treatment should be considered. To minimize the risk of glucocorticoidinduced bone loss, the smallest possible effective dosage and duration should be used. Lifestyle modification to reduce the risk of osteoporosis (e.g., cigarette smoking cessation, limitation of alcohol consumption, participation in weightbearing exercise for 3060 minutes daily) should be encouraged. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation, bisphosphonate (e.g., alendronate, risedronate), and a weightbearing exercise program that maintains muscle mass are suitable firstline therapies aimed at reducing the risk of adverse bone effects. Current recommendations suggest that all interventions be initiated in any patient in whom glucocorticoid therapy with at least the equivalent of 5 mg of prednisone for at least 3 months is anticipated in addition, sex hormone replacement therapy (combined estrogen and progestin in women testosterone in men) should be offered to such patients who are hypogonadal or in whom replacement is otherwise clinically indicated and biphosphonate therapy should be initiated (if not already) if bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine andor hip is below normal. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Multiple Sclerosis .) An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatinine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years. Psychiatric derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored. Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly or without medical supervision. As prolonged use may cause adrenal insufficiency and make patients dependent on corticosteroids, they should advise any medical attendants that they are taking corticosteroids and they should seek medical advice at once should they develop an acute illness including fever or other signs of infection. Following prolonged therapy, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in symptoms of the corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome including, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise. Persons who are on corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay. Amphotericin B Injection and PotassiumDepleting Agents When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassiumdepleting agents (e.g., amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia. In addition, there have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure. Antibiotics Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance (See PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates). Anticholinesterases Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents (e.g., neostigmine, pyridostigmine) and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy. If concomitant therapy must occur, it should take place under close supervision and the need for respiratory support should be anticipated. Anticoagulants, Oral Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect. Antidiabetics Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required. Antitubercular Drugs Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased. Bupropion Since systemic steroids, as well as bupropion, can lower the seizure threshold, concurrent administration should be undertaken only with extreme caution low initial dosing and small gradual increases should be employed. Cholestyramine Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids. Cyclosporine Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use. Digitalis Glycosides Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia. Estrogens, Including Oral Contraceptives Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect. Fluoroquinolones Postmarketing surveillance reports indicate that the risk of tendon rupture may be increased in patients receiving concomitant fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) and corticosteroids, especially in the elderly. Tendon rupture can occur during or after treatment with quinolones. Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased. Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids are moderate inducers of CYP 3A4. Coadministration with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g., indinavir, erythromycin) may increase their clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60, leading to increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. In addition, ketoconazole alone can inhibit adrenal corticosteroid synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal. Nonsteroidal AntiInflammatory Agents (NSAIDS) Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids this could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn. Phenytoin In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in phenytoin levels with dexamethasone coadministration, leading to alterations in seizure control. Phenytoin has been demonstrated to increase the hepatic metabolism of corticosteroids, resulting in a decreased therapeutic effect of the corticosteroid. Quetiapine Increased doses of quetiapine may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving a glucocorticoid, a hepatic enzyme inducer. Skin Tests Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests. Thalidomide Coadministration with thalidomide should be employed cautiously, as toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported with concomitant use. Vaccines Patients on corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (See WARNINGS Infection Vaccination). No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether corticosteroids have a potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis. Steroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermatozoa in some patients. Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in many species when given in doses equivalent to the human dose. Animal studies in which corticosteroids have been given to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have yielded an increased incidence of cleft palate in the offspring. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from corticosteroids, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the wellestablished course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (patients 2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (patients 1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and wellcontrolled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations. The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In particular, the increased risk of diabetes mellitus, fluid retention and hypertension in elderly patients treated with corticosteroids should be considered.</td></tr>

There was no evidence for carcinogenicity of citalopram in mice receiving up to 240 mgkgday, which is equivalent to 20 times the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHD) of 60 mg on a surface area (mgm2) basis. There was an increased incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats receiving 8 or 24 mgkgday, doses which are approximately 1.3 and 4 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mgm2 basis. A noeffect dose for this finding was not established. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Citalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in a coupled in vitroin vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays. Impairment of Fertility When citalopram was administered orally to 16 male and 24 female rats prior to and throughout mating and gestation at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mgkgday, mating was decreased at all doses, and fertility was decreased at doses  32 mgkgday, approximately 5 times the MRHD of 60 mgday on a body surface area (mgm2) basis. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mgkgday, approximately 8 times the MRHD.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>"Pharmacokinetics The single and multipledose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and doseproportional in a dose range of 1060 mgday. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal halflife of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the halflife, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose. The tablet and oral solution dosage forms of citalopram HBr are bioequivalent. Absorption and Distribution Following a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80 relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 Lkg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80. Metabolism and Elimination Following intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10 and 5, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mLmin, with approximately 20 of that due to renal clearance. Citalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopramNoxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citaloprams metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately onehalf and onetenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the Ndemethylation of citalopram. Population Subgroups Age Citalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects  60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a singledose study, citalopram AUC and halflife were increased in the elderly subjects by 30 and 50, respectively, whereas in a multipledose study they were increased by 23 and 30, respectively. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most elderly patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Gender In three pharmacokinetic studies (total N32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N237) and women (N388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is recommended. Reduced hepatic function Citalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37 and halflife was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most hepatically impaired patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Reduced renal function In patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17 compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance  20 mLmin). DrugDrug Interactions In vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, 2C9, or 2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2D6, and 2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited. Since CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Citalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive 2D6 metabolizers after multipledose administration of citalopram HBr, suggesting that coadministration, with citalopram HBr, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism. See Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS for more detailed information on available drug interaction data."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C In animal reproduction studies, citalopram has been shown to have adverse effects on embryofetal and postnatal development, including teratogenic effects, when administered at doses greater than human therapeutic doses. In two rat embryofetal development studies, oral administration of citalopram (32, 56, or 112 mgkgday) to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased embryofetal growth and survival and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects) at the high dose, which is approximately 18 times the MRHD of 60 mgday on a body surface area (mgm2) basis. This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity (clinical signs, decreased body weight gain). The developmental, noeffect dose of 56 mgkgday is approximately 9 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. In a rabbit study, no adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed at doses of up to 16 mgkgday, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. Thus, teratogenic effects were observed at a maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit. When female rats were treated with citalopram (4.8, 12.8, or 32 mgkgday) from late gestation through weaning, increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent offspring growth retardation were observed at the highest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. The noeffect dose of 12.8 mgkgday is approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. Similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses  24 mgkgday, approximately 4 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. A noeffect dose was not determined in that study. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women therefore, citalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to citalopram HBr and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS ). Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1to 2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective, casecontrol study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately sixfold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk. When treating a pregnant woman with citalopram HBr during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS General Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram HBr During marketing of citalopram HBr and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally selflimiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with citalopram HBr. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Abnormal Bleeding SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (casecontrol and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to lifethreatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation. Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and was reversible when citalopram HBr. was discontinued. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmolL have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk (see Geriatric Use). Discontinuation of citalopram HBr.should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe andor acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Activation of ManiaHypomania In placebocontrolled trials of citalopram HBr, some of which included patients with bipolar disorder, activation of maniahypomania was reported in 0.2 of 1063 patients treated with citalopram HBr and in none of the 446 patients treated with placebo. Activation of maniahypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with other marketed antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, citalopram HBr should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. Seizures Although anticonvulsant effects of citalopram have been observed in animal studies, citalopram HBr has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the products premarketing testing. In clinical trials of citalopram HBr, seizures occurred in 0.3 of patients treated with citalopram HBr (a rate of one patient per 98 years of exposure) and 0.5 of patients treated with placebo (a rate of one patient per 50 years of exposure). Like other antidepressants, citalopram HBr should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder. Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance In studies in normal volunteers, citalopram HBr in doses of 40 mgday did not produce impairment of intellectual function or psychomotor performance. Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that citalopram HBr therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with citalopram HBr in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using citalopram HBr in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Citalopram HBr has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the products premarketing testing. However, the electrocardiograms of 1116 patients who received citalopram HBr in clinical trials were evaluated and the data indicate that citalopram HBr is not associated with the development of clinically significant ECG abnormalities. In subjects with hepatic impairment, citalopram clearance was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The use of citalopram HBr in hepatically impaired patients should be approached with caution and a lower maximum dosage is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Because citalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with citalopram HBr, however, it should be used with caution in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Information for Patients Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe citalopram HBr. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and triptans, tramadol or other serotonergic agents. Although in controlled studies citalopram HBr has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, so patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that citalopram HBr therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. Patients should be told that, although citalopram HBr has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised. Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or overthecounter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions. Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding an infant. While patients may notice improvement with citalopram HBr therapy in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed. Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with citalopram HBr and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions is available for citalopram HBr. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking citalopram HBr. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a daytoday basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. Laboratory Tests There are no specific laboratory tests recommended. Drug Interactions Serotonergic Drugs Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs including citalopram HBr, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when citalopram HBr is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible nonselective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. Johns Wort (see WARNINGSSerotonin Syndrome ). The concomitant use of citalopram HBr with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS  Drug Interactions ). Triptans There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of citalopram HBr with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS  Serotonin Syndrome ). CNS Drugs Given the primary CNS effects of citalopram, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Alcohol Although citalopram did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of alcohol by depressed patients taking citalopram HBr is not recommended. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS . Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the casecontrol and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when citalopram HBr is initiated or discontinued. Cimetidine In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mgday citalopram HBr, combined administration of 400 mgday cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and Cmax of 43 and 39, respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Digoxin In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mgday citalopram HBr, combined administration of citalopram HBr and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin. Lithium Coadministration of citalopram HBr (40 mgday for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmolday for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium. Nevertheless, plasma lithium levels should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the lithium dose in accordance with standard clinical practice. Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of citalopram, caution should be exercised when citalopram HBr and lithium are coadministered. Pimozide In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg coadministered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or Cmax of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. Theophylline Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mgday for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated. Sumatriptan There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a SSRI and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Warfarin Administration of 40 mgday citalopram HBr for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Carbamazepine Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mgday for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mgday for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzymeinducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered. Triazolam Combined administration of citalopram HBr (titrated to 40 mgday for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam. Ketoconazole Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of ketoconazole by 21 and 10, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. CYP3A4 and 2C19 Inhibitors In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Metoprolol Administration of 40 mgday citalopram HBr for 22 days resulted in a twofold increase in the plasma levels of the betaadrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram HBr and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate. Imipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) In vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram HBr (40 mgday for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with citalopram HBr.. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) There are no clinical studies of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and citalopram HBr. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Citalopram was administered in the diet to NMRIBOM strain mice and COBS WI strain rats for 18 and 24 months, respectively. There was no evidence for carcinogenicity of citalopram in mice receiving up to 240 mgkgday, which is equivalent to 20 times the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHD) of 60 mg on a surface area (mgm2) basis. There was an increased incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats receiving 8 or 24 mgkgday, doses which are approximately 1.3 and 4 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mgm2 basis. A noeffect dose for this finding was not established. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Citalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in a coupled in vitroin vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays. Impairment of Fertility When citalopram was administered orally to 16 male and 24 female rats prior to and throughout mating and gestation at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mgkgday, mating was decreased at all doses, and fertility was decreased at doses  32 mgkgday, approximately 5 times the MRHD of 60 mgday on a body surface area (mgm2) basis. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mgkgday, approximately 8 times the MRHD. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C In animal reproduction studies, citalopram has been shown to have adverse effects on embryofetal and postnatal development, including teratogenic effects, when administered at doses greater than human therapeutic doses. In two rat embryofetal development studies, oral administration of citalopram (32, 56, or 112 mgkgday) to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased embryofetal growth and survival and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects) at the high dose, which is approximately 18 times the MRHD of 60 mgday on a body surface area (mgm2) basis. This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity (clinical signs, decreased body weight gain). The developmental, noeffect dose of 56 mgkgday is approximately 9 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. In a rabbit study, no adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed at doses of up to 16 mgkgday, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. Thus, teratogenic effects were observed at a maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit. When female rats were treated with citalopram (4.8, 12.8, or 32 mgkgday) from late gestation through weaning, increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent offspring growth retardation were observed at the highest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. The noeffect dose of 12.8 mgkgday is approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. Similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses  24 mgkgday, approximately 4 times the MRHD on a mgm2 basis. A noeffect dose was not determined in that study. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women therefore, citalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to citalopram HBr and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS ). Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1to 2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective, casecontrol study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately sixfold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk. When treating a pregnant woman with citalopram HBr during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication. Labor and Delivery The effect of citalopram HBr on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Nursing Mothers As has been found to occur with many other drugs, citalopram is excreted in human breast milk. There have been two reports of infants experiencing excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss in association with breastfeeding from a citalopramtreated mother in one case, the infant was reported to recover completely upon discontinuation of citalopram by its mother and in the second case, no followup information was available. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or citalopram HBr therapy should take into account the risks of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits of citalopram HBr treatment for the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (see BOX WARNING and WARNINGSClinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Two placebocontrolled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram HBr, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of citalopram HBr in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. Geriatric Use Of 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram HBr, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Most elderly patients treated with citalopram HBr in clinical trials received daily doses between 20 and 40 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see PRECAUTIONS, Hyponatremia). In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23 and 30, respectively, in elderly subjects as compared to younger subjects, and its halflife was increased by 30 and 50, respectively (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). 20 mgday is the recommended dose for most elderly patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>"Drug Interactions Serotonergic Drugs Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs including citalopram HBr, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when citalopram HBr is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible nonselective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. Johns Wort (see WARNINGSSerotonin Syndrome ). The concomitant use of citalopram HBr with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS  Drug Interactions ). Triptans There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of citalopram HBr with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS  Serotonin Syndrome ). CNS Drugs Given the primary CNS effects of citalopram, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Alcohol Although citalopram did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of alcohol by depressed patients taking citalopram HBr is not recommended. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS . Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the casecontrol and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when citalopram HBr is initiated or discontinued. Cimetidine In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mgday citalopram HBr, combined administration of 400 mgday cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and Cmax of 43 and 39, respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Digoxin In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mgday citalopram HBr, combined administration of citalopram HBr and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin. Lithium Coadministration of citalopram HBr (40 mgday for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmolday for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium. Nevertheless, plasma lithium levels should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the lithium dose in accordance with standard clinical practice. Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of citalopram, caution should be exercised when citalopram HBr and lithium are coadministered. Pimozide In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg coadministered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or Cmax of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. Theophylline Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mgday for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated. Sumatriptan There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a SSRI and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Warfarin Administration of 40 mgday citalopram HBr for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Carbamazepine Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mgday for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mgday for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzymeinducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered. Triazolam Combined administration of citalopram HBr (titrated to 40 mgday for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam. Ketoconazole Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of ketoconazole by 21 and 10, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. CYP3A4 and 2C19 Inhibitors In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Metoprolol Administration of 40 mgday citalopram HBr for 22 days resulted in a twofold increase in the plasma levels of the betaadrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram HBr and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate. Imipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) In vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram HBr (40 mgday for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with citalopram HBr.. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) There are no clinical studies of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and citalopram HBr."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS AND USAGE Citalopram HBr is indicated for the treatment of depression. The efficacy of citalopram HBr in the treatment of depression was established in 4 to 6 week, controlled trials of outpatients whose diagnosis corresponded most closely to the DSMIII and DSMIIIR category of major depressive disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). A major depressive episode (DSMIV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight andor appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The antidepressant action of citalopram HBr in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied. The efficacy of citalopram HBr in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 24 weeks following 6 to 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in two placebocontrolled trials (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use citalopram HBr for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the longterm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>spl_unclassified_section</i>:</td><td>Rx Only, "WARNINGSClinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression andor the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a longstanding concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of shortterm placebocontrolled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Shortterm studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 shortterm trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebocontrolled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 shortterm trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drugplacebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. TABLE 1 Age Range DrugPlacebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated DrugRelated Increases 18 14 additional cases 1824 5 additional cases DrugRelated Decreases 2564 1 fewer case 65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longerterm use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebocontrolled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression andor the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONDiscontinuation of Treatment with citalopram HBr, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of citalopram HBr. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for citalopram HBr should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixedmanic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that citalopram HBr is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Potential for Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors In patients receiving serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma. These reactions have also been reported in patients who have recently discontinued SSRI treatment and have been started on an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Furthermore, limited animal data on the effects of combined use of SSRIs and MAOIs suggest that these drugs may act synergistically to elevate blood pressure and evoke behavioral excitation. Therefore, it is recommended that citalopram HBr should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping citalopram HBr before starting an MAOI. Serotonin Syndrome The development of a potentially lifethreatening serotonin syndrome may occur with SNRIs and SSRIs, including citalopram HBr treatment, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) and with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) andor gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, diarrhea). The concomitant use of citalopram HBr with MAOIs intended to treat depression is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS  Potential for Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors .) If concomitant treatment of citalopram HBr with a 5hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist (triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see PRECAUTIONS  Drug Interactions ).The concomitant use of citalopram HBr with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan) is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS  Drug Interactions )."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>"ADVERSE REACTIONS The premarketing development program for citalopram HBr included citalopram exposures in patients andor normal subjects from 3 different groups of studies 429 normal subjects in clinical pharmacologypharmacokinetic studies 4422 exposures from patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, corresponding to approximately 1370 patientexposure years. There were, in addition, over 19,000 exposures from mostly openlabel, European postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with citalopram HBr varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) openlabel and doubleblind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixeddose and dosetitration studies, and shortterm and longterm exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatmentemergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatmentemergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in ShortTerm, PlaceboControlled Trials Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram HBr at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mgday in placebocontrolled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration, 16 discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 8 of 446 patients receiving placebo. The adverse events associated with discontinuation and considered drugrelated (i.e., associated with discontinuation in at least 1 of citalopram HBrtreated patients at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are shown in TABLE 2 . It should be noted that one patient can report more than one reason for discontinuation and be counted more than once in this table.

Events included are those occurring in 2 or more of patients treated with citalopram HBr and for which the incidence in patients treated with citalopram HBr was greater than the incidence in placebotreated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied. The only commonly observed adverse event that occurred in citalopram HBr patients with an incidence of 5 or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo patients was ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay) in male patients (see TABLE 3 ). TABLE 3 TreatmentEmergent Adverse Events Incidence in PlaceboControlled Clinical Trials Events reported by at least 2 of patients treated with citalopram HBr are reported, except for the following events which had an incidence on placebo  citalopram HBr headache, asthenia, dizziness, constipation, palpitation, vision abnormal, sleep disorder, nervousness, pharyngitis, micturition disorder, back pain. 1Denominator used was for females only (N638 citalopram HBr N252 placebo). 2Primarily ejaculatory delay. 3Denominator used was for males only (N425 citalopram HBr N194 placebo).

Jonckheeres trend test revealed a positive dose response (p0.05) for the following adverse events fatigue, impotence, insomnia, sweating increased, somnolence, and yawning. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. The table below displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2 of patients taking citalopram HBr in a pool of placebocontrolled clinical trials in patients with depression. Treatment Citalopram HBr (425 males) Placebo (194 males) Abnormal Ejaculation (mostly ejaculatory delay) 6.1 (males only) 1 (males only) Libido Decreased 3.8 (males only) 1 (males only) Impotence 2.8 (males only) 1 (males only) In female depressed patients receiving citalopram HBr, the reported incidence of decreased libido and anorgasmia was 1.3 (n638 females) and 1.1 (n252 females), respectively. There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with citalopram treatment. Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Vital Sign Changes Citalopram HBr and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with citalopram HBr treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures for citalopram HBr and placebo treatments indicated that citalopram HBr treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes. Weight Changes Patients treated with citalopram HBr in controlled trials experienced a weight loss of about 0.5 kg compared to no change for placebo patients. Laboratory Changes Citalopram HBr and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with citalopram HBr treatment. ECG Changes Electrocardiograms from citalopram HBr (N802) and placebo (N241) groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various ECG parameters, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. The only statistically significant drugplacebo difference observed was a decrease in heart rate for citalopram HBr of 1.7 bpm compared to no change in heart rate for placebo. There were no observed differences in QT or other ECG intervals. Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Citalopram HBr Following is a list of WHO terms that reflect treatmentemergent adverse events, as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section, reported by patients treated with citalopram HBr at multiple doses in a range of 10 to 80 mgday during any phase of a trial within the premarketing database of 4422 patients. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, and those occurring in only one patient. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with citalopram HBr, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1100 patients infrequent adverse events are those occurring in less than 1100 patients but at least 11000 patients rare events are those occurring in fewer than 11000 patients.

<tr><td><i>nonteratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to citalopram HBr and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS ). Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1to 2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective, casecontrol study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately sixfold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk. When treating a pregnant woman with citalopram HBr during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial Treatment Citalopram HBr should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mgday. Dose increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mgday, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mgday dose over the 40 mgday dose doses above 40 mg are therefore not ordinarily recommended. Citalopram HBr should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food. Special Populations 20 mgday is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment, with titration to 40 mgday only for nonresponding patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Citalopram HBr should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester Neonates exposed to citalopram HBr and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS ). When treating pregnant women with citalopram HBr during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering citalopram HBr in the third trimester. Maintenance Treatment It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic evaluation of citalopram HBr in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of citalopram HBr (2060 mgday) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of citalopram HBr 20 or 40 mgday, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Based on these limited data, it is not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mgday can be considered. Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram HBr Symptoms associated with discontinuation of citalopram HBr and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of citalopram HBr therapy. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping citalopram HBr before starting an MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ).</td></tr>

Physical and Psychological Dependence Animal studies suggest that the abuse liability of citalopram HBr is low. Citalopram HBr has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. The premarketing clinical experience with citalopram HBr did not reveal any drugseeking behavior. However, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict, on the basis of this limited experience, the extent to which a CNSactive drug will be misused, diverted, andor abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate citalopram HBr patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementations of dose, drugseeking behavior).</td></tr>

This Medication Guide is only about the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions with antidepressant medicines. Talk to your, or your family members, healthcare provider about  all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines  all treatment choices for depression or other serious mental illness What is the most important information I should know about antidepressant medicines, depression and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions? 1. Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts and actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. 2. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include people who have (or have a family history of) bipolar illness (also called manicdepressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions. 3. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member?  Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant is started or when the dose is changed.  Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.  Keep all followup visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms. Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you  thoughts about suicide or dying  attempts to commit suicide  new or worse depression  new or worse anxiety  feeling very agitated or restless  panic attacks  trouble sleeping (insomnia)  new or worse irritability  acting aggressive, being angry, or violent  acting on dangerous impulses  an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)  other unusual changes in behavior or mood What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines?  Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms.  Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants.  Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member.  Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the medicines that you or your family member takes. Keep a list of all medicines to show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking with your healthcare provider.  Not all antidepressant medicines prescribed for children are FDA approved for use in children. Talk to your childs healthcare provider for more information. This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for all antidepressants.

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>"Information for Patients Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe citalopram HBr. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and triptans, tramadol or other serotonergic agents. Although in controlled studies citalopram HBr has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, so patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that citalopram HBr therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. Patients should be told that, although citalopram HBr has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised. Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or overthecounter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions. Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding an infant. While patients may notice improvement with citalopram HBr therapy in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed. Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with citalopram HBr and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions is available for citalopram HBr. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking citalopram HBr. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a daytoday basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>"General Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram HBr During marketing of citalopram HBr and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally selflimiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with citalopram HBr. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Abnormal Bleeding SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (casecontrol and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to lifethreatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation. Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and was reversible when citalopram HBr. was discontinued. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmolL have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk (see Geriatric Use). Discontinuation of citalopram HBr.should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe andor acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Activation of ManiaHypomania In placebocontrolled trials of citalopram HBr, some of which included patients with bipolar disorder, activation of maniahypomania was reported in 0.2 of 1063 patients treated with citalopram HBr and in none of the 446 patients treated with placebo. Activation of maniahypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with other marketed antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, citalopram HBr should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. Seizures Although anticonvulsant effects of citalopram have been observed in animal studies, citalopram HBr has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the products premarketing testing. In clinical trials of citalopram HBr, seizures occurred in 0.3 of patients treated with citalopram HBr (a rate of one patient per 98 years of exposure) and 0.5 of patients treated with placebo (a rate of one patient per 50 years of exposure). Like other antidepressants, citalopram HBr should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder. Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance In studies in normal volunteers, citalopram HBr in doses of 40 mgday did not produce impairment of intellectual function or psychomotor performance. Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that citalopram HBr therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with citalopram HBr in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using citalopram HBr in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Citalopram HBr has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the products premarketing testing. However, the electrocardiograms of 1116 patients who received citalopram HBr in clinical trials were evaluated and the data indicate that citalopram HBr is not associated with the development of clinically significant ECG abnormalities. In subjects with hepatic impairment, citalopram clearance was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The use of citalopram HBr in hepatically impaired patients should be approached with caution and a lower maximum dosage is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Because citalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with citalopram HBr, however, it should be used with caution in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics The mechanism of action of citalopram HBr as an antidepressant is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5HT). In vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake. Tolerance to the inhibition of 5HT uptake is not induced by longterm (14day) treatment of rats with citalopram. Citalopram is a racemic mixture (5050), and the inhibition of 5HT reuptake by citalopram is primarily due to the (S)enantiomer. Citalopram has no or very low affinity for 5HT1A, 5HT2A, dopamine D1 and D2, 1, 2, and adrenergic, histamine H1, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of other psychotropic drugs. Pharmacokinetics The single and multipledose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and doseproportional in a dose range of 1060 mgday. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal halflife of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the halflife, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose. The tablet and oral solution dosage forms of citalopram HBr are bioequivalent. Absorption and Distribution Following a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80 relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 Lkg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80. Metabolism and Elimination Following intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10 and 5, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mLmin, with approximately 20 of that due to renal clearance. Citalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopramNoxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citaloprams metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately onehalf and onetenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the Ndemethylation of citalopram. Population Subgroups Age Citalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects  60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a singledose study, citalopram AUC and halflife were increased in the elderly subjects by 30 and 50, respectively, whereas in a multipledose study they were increased by 23 and 30, respectively. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most elderly patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Gender In three pharmacokinetic studies (total N32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N237) and women (N388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is recommended. Reduced hepatic function Citalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37 and halflife was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most hepatically impaired patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Reduced renal function In patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17 compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance  20 mLmin). DrugDrug Interactions In vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, 2C9, or 2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2D6, and 2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited. Since CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Citalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive 2D6 metabolizers after multipledose administration of citalopram HBr, suggesting that coadministration, with citalopram HBr, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism. See Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS for more detailed information on available drug interaction data. Clinical Efficacy Trials The efficacy of citalopram HBr as a treatment for depression was established in two placebocontrolled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks in duration) in adult outpatients (ages 1866) meeting DSMIII or DSMIIIR criteria for major depression. Study 1, a 6week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram HBr doses of 10, 20, 40, and 60 mgday, showed that citalopram HBr at doses of 40 and 60 mgday was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the HAMD depressed mood item (Item 1), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity scale. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 and 20 mgday doses, and the 60 mgday dose was not more effective than the 40 mgday dose. In study 2, a 4week, placebocontrolled trial in depressed patients, of whom 85 met criteria for melancholia, the initial dose was 20 mgday, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mgday. Patients treated with citalopram HBr showed significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, HAMD item 1, and the CGI Severity score. In three additional placebocontrolled depression trials, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram HBr and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant, possibly due to high spontaneous response rate, smaller sample size, or, in the case of one study, too low a dose. In two longterm studies, depressed patients who had responded to citalopram HBr during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment (fixed doses of 20 or 40 mgday in one study and flexible doses of 2060 mgday in the second study) were randomized to continuation of citalopram HBr or to placebo. In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram HBr treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixeddose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 or 40 mgday of citalopram HBr. Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics. Comparison of Clinical Trial Results Highly variable results have been seen in the clinical development of all antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, in those circumstances when the drugs have not been studied in the same controlled clinical trial(s), comparisons among the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of different antidepressant drug products are inherently unreliable. Because conditions of testing (e.g., patient samples, investigators, doses of the treatments administered and compared, outcome measures, etc.) vary among trials, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a difference in drug effect from a difference due to one of the confounding factors just enumerated."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Geriatric Use Of 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram HBr, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Most elderly patients treated with citalopram HBr in clinical trials received daily doses between 20 and 40 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see PRECAUTIONS, Hyponatremia). In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23 and 30, respectively, in elderly subjects as compared to younger subjects, and its halflife was increased by 30 and 50, respectively (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). 20 mgday is the recommended dose for most elderly patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in shortterm studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of Citalopram HBr or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Shortterm studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Citalopram HBr is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Human Experience In clinical trials of citalopram, there were reports of citalopram overdose, including overdoses of up to 2000 mg, with no associated fatalities. During the postmarketing evaluation of citalopram, citalopram HBr overdoses, including overdoses of up to 6000 mg, have been reported. As with other SSRIs, a fatal outcome in a patient who has taken an overdose of citalopram has been rarely reported. Symptoms most often accompanying citalopram overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs andor alcohol, included dizziness, sweating, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, tremor, somnolence, and sinus tachycardia. In more rare cases, observed symptoms included amnesia, confusion, coma, convulsions, hyperventilation, cyanosis, rhabdomyolysis, and ECG changes (including QTc prolongation, nodal rhythm, ventricular arrhythmia, and very rare cases of torsade de pointes). Acute renal failure has been very rarely reported accompanying overdose. Management of Overdose Establish and maintain an airway to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are recommended, along with general symptomatic and supportive care. Due to the large volume of distribution of citalopram, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. There are no specific antidotes for citalopram HBr. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multipledrug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>Pharmacodynamics The mechanism of action of citalopram HBr as an antidepressant is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5HT). In vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake. Tolerance to the inhibition of 5HT uptake is not induced by longterm (14day) treatment of rats with citalopram. Citalopram is a racemic mixture (5050), and the inhibition of 5HT reuptake by citalopram is primarily due to the (S)enantiomer. Citalopram has no or very low affinity for 5HT1A, 5HT2A, dopamine D1 and D2, 1, 2, and adrenergic, histamine H1, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of other psychotropic drugs.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>animal_pharmacology_and_or_toxicology</i>:</td><td>ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY Retinal Changes in Rats Pathologic changes (degenerationatrophy) were observed in the retinas of albino rats in the 2year carcinogenicity study with citalopram. There was an increase in both incidence and severity of retinal pathology in both male and female rats receiving 80 mgkgday (13 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 60 mg on a mgm2 basis). Similar findings were not present in rats receiving 24 mgkgday for two years, in mice treated for 18 months at doses up to 240 mgkgday, or in dogs treated for one year at doses up to 20 mgkgday (4, 20, and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose on a mgm2 basis). Additional studies to investigate the mechanism for this pathology have not been performed, and the potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established. Cardiovascular Changes in Dogs In a oneyear toxicology study, 5 of 10 beagle dogs receiving oral doses of 8 mgkgday (4 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 60 mg on a mgm2 basis) died suddenly between weeks 17 and 31 following initiation of treatment. Although appropriate data from that study are not available to directly compare plasma levels of citalopram (CT) and its metabolites, demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), to levels that have been achieved in humans, pharmacokinetic data indicate that the relative dogtohuman exposure was greater for the metabolites than for citalopram. Sudden deaths were not observed in rats at doses up to 120 mgkgday, which produced plasma levels of CT, DCT, and DDCT similar to those observed in dogs at doses of 8 mgkgday. A subsequent intravenous dosing study demonstrated that in beagle dogs, DDCT caused QT prolongation, a known risk factor for the observed outcome in dogs. This effect occurred in dogs at doses producing peak DDCT plasma levels of 810 to 3250 nM (39155 times the mean steady state DDCT plasma level measured at the maximum recommended human daily dose of 60 mg). In dogs, peak DDCT plasma concentrations are approximately equal to peak CT plasma concentrations, whereas in humans, steady state DDCT plasma concentrations are less than 10 of steady state CT plasma concentrations. Assays of DDCT plasma concentrations in 2020 citalopramtreated individuals demonstrated that DDCT levels rarely exceeded 70 nM the highest measured level of DDCT in human overdose was 138 nM. While DDCT is ordinarily present in humans at lower levels than in dogs, it is unknown whether there are individuals who may achieve higher DDCT levels. The possibility that DCT, a principal metabolite in humans, may prolong the QT interval in dogs has not been directly examined because DCT is rapidly converted to DDCT in that species. APOTEX INC.

There was an increased incidence of stillbirths at doses of 20 times the human dose or greater. There are no wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women therefore, use diltiazem in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS General Diltiazem is extensively metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys and in bile. As with any drug given over prolonged periods, laboratory parameters of renal and hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals. The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. In subacute and chronic dog and rat studies designed to produce toxicity, high doses of diltiazem were associated with hepatic damage. In special subacute hepatic studies, oral doses of 125 mgkg and higher in rats were associated with histological changes in the liver, which were reversible when the drug was discontinued. In dogs, doses of 20 mgkg were also associated with hepatic changes however, these changes were reversible with continued dosing. Dermatological events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS) may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of diltiazem. However, skin eruptions progressing to erythema multiforme andor exfoliative dermatitis have also been infrequently reported. Should a dermatologic reaction persist, the drug should be discontinued. Drug Interactions Due to the potential for additive effects, caution and careful titration are warranted in patients receiving diltiazem concomitantly with any agents known to affect cardiac contractility andor conduction (see WARNINGS). Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using betablockers or digitalis concomitantly with diltiazem (see WARNINGS). As with all drugs, care should be exercised when treating patients with multiple medications. Diltiazem is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Other drugs that are specific substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of this enzyme system may have a significant impact on the efficacy and side effect profile of diltiazem. Patients taking other drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4, especially patients with renal andor hepatic impairment, may require dosage adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered diltiazem in order to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels. Anesthetics The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity, as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics, may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully. Benzodiazepines Studies showed that diltiazem increased the AUC of midazolam and triazolam by 3 to 4 fold and the Cmax by 2 fold, compared to placebo. The elimination halflife of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5 to 2.5 fold) during coadministration with diltiazem. These pharmacokinetic effects seen during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects (e.g., prolonged sedation) of both midazolam and triazolam. BetaBlockers Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of diltiazem and betablockers is usually well tolerated. Available data are not sufficient, however, to predict the effects of concomitant treatment, particularly in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities. Administration of diltiazem concomitantly with propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects, and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50. In vitro, propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem. If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with propranolol, an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted (see WARNINGS). Buspirone In nine healthy subjects, diltiazem significantly increased the mean buspirone AUC 5.5 fold and Cmax 4.1 fold compared to placebo. The T12 and Tmax of buspirone were not significantly affected by diltiazem. Enhanced effects and increased toxicity of buspirone may be possible during concomitant administration with diltiazem. Subsequent dose adjustments may be necessary during coadministration, and should be based on clinical assessment. Carbamazepine Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40 to 72 increase) resulting in toxicity in some cases. Patients receiving these drugs concurrently should be monitored for a potential drug interaction. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58) and areaunderthecurve (53) after a 1 week course of cimetidine at 1200 mg per day and a single dose of diltiazem 60 mg. Ranitidine produced smaller, nonsignificant increases. The effect may be mediated by cimetidines known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450, the enzyme system responsible for the firstpass metabolism of diltiazem. Patients currently receiving diltiazem therapy should be carefully monitored for a change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with cimetidine. An adjustment in the diltiazem dose may be warranted. Clonidine Sinus bradycardia resulting in hospitalization and pacemaker insertion has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concurrently with diltiazem. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving concomitant diltiazem and clonidine. Cyclosporine A pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem and cyclosporine has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients. In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of cyclosporine trough dose ranging from 15 to 48 was necessary to maintain concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of diltiazem. If these agents are to be administered concurrently, cyclosporine concentrations should be monitored, especially when diltiazem therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued. The effect of cyclosporine on diltiazem plasma concentrations has not been evaluated. Digitalis Administration of diltiazem with digoxin in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in 12 patients with coronary artery disease. Since there have been conflicting results regarding the effect of digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing diltiazem therapy to avoid possible over or underdigitalization (see WARNINGS). Quinidine Diltiazem significantly increases the AUC (0) of quinidine by 51, T1 2 by 36, and decreases its CLoral by 33. Monitoring for quinidine adverse effects may be warranted and the dose adjusted accordingly. Rifampin Coadministration of rifampin with diltiazem lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels. Coadministration of diltiazem with rifampin or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered. Statins Diltiazem is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and has been shown to increase significantly the AUC of some statins. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with statins metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased with concomitant use of diltiazem. When possible, use a nonCYP3A4metabolized statin together with diltiazem otherwise, dose adjustments for both diltiazem and the statin should be considered along with close monitoring for signs and symptoms of any statin related adverse events. In a healthy volunteer crossover study (N  10), coadministration of a single 20 mg dose of simvastatin at the end of a 14 day regimen with 120 mg BID diltiazem SR resulted in a 5 fold increase in mean simvastatin AUC versus simvastatin alone. Subjects with increased average steadystate exposures of diltiazem showed a greater fold increase in simvastatin exposure. Computerbased simulations showed that at a daily dose of 480 mg of diltiazem, an 8 to 9 fold mean increase in simvastatin AUC can be expected. If coadministration of simvastatin with diltiazem is required, limit the daily doses of simvastatin to 10 mg and diltiazem to 240 mg. In a tensubject randomized, open label, 4 way crossover study, coadministration of diltiazem (120 mg BID diltiazem SR for 2 weeks) with a single 20 mg dose of lovastatin resulted in 3 to 4 fold increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax versus lovastatin alone. In the same study, there was no significant change in 20 mg single dose pravastatin AUC and Cmax during diltiazem coadministration. Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24 month study in rats and a 21 month study in mice showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. There was also no mutagenic response in in vitro bacterial tests. No intrinsic effect on fertility was observed in rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Reproduction studies have been conducted in mice, rats, and rabbits.

There was an increased incidence of stillbirths at doses of 20 times the human dose or greater. There are no wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women therefore, use diltiazem in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Diltiazem is excreted in human milk. One report suggests that concentrations in breast milk may approximate serum levels. If use of diltiazem is deemed essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be instituted. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of diltiazem did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."</td></tr>

There have been observed cases of a generalized rash, some characterized as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In addition, events such as myocardial infarction have been observed, which are not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. A definitive cause and effect relationship between these events and diltiazem therapy cannot yet be established. Exfoliative dermatitis (proven by rechallenge) has also been reported.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>"WARNINGS 1. Cardiac Conduction. Diltiazem prolongs AV node refractory periods without significantly prolonging sinus node recovery time, except in patients with sick sinus syndrome. This effect may rarely result in abnormally slow heart rates (particularly in patients with sick sinus syndrome) or second or thirddegree AV block (six of 1243 patients for 0.48). Concomitant use of diltiazem with betablockers or digitalis may result in additive effects on cardiac conduction. A patient with Prinzmetals angina developed periods of asystole (2 to 5 seconds) after a single dose of 60 mg of diltiazem (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). 2. Congestive Heart Failure. Although diltiazem has a negative inotropic effect in isolated animal tissue preparations, hemodynamic studies in humans with normal ventricular function have not shown a reduction in cardiac index nor consistent negative effects on contractility (dpdt). Experience with the use of diltiazem alone or in combination with betablockers in patients with impaired ventricular function is very limited. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in such patients. 3. Hypotension. Decreases in blood pressure associated with diltiazem therapy may occasionally result in symptomatic hypotension. 4. Acute Hepatic Injury. In rare instances, significant elevations in enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, LDH, SGOT, SGPT, and other phenomena consistent with acute hepatic injury have been noted. These reactions have been reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. The relationship to diltiazem is uncertain in most cases, but probable in some (see PRECAUTIONS)."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The therapeutic benefits achieved with diltiazem are believed to be related to its ability to inhibit the influx of calcium ions during membrane depolarization of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. Mechanisms of Action Although precise mechanisms of its antianginal actions are still being delineated, diltiazem is believed to act in the following ways Angina Due to Coronary Artery Spasm. Diltiazem has been shown to be a potent dilator of coronary arteries both epicardial and subendocardial. Spontaneous and ergonovineinduced coronary artery spasm are inhibited by diltiazem. Exertional Angina. Diltiazem has been shown to produce increases in exercise tolerance, probably due to its ability to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. This is accomplished via reductions in heart rate and systemic blood pressure at submaximal and maximal exercise workloads. In animal models, diltiazem interferes with the slow inward (depolarizing) current in excitable tissue. It causes excitationcontraction uncoupling in various myocardial tissues without changes in the configuration of the action potential. Diltiazem produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle and dilation of both large and small coronary arteries at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. The resultant increases in coronary blood flow (epicardial and subendocardial) occur in ischemic and nonischemic models and are accompanied by dosedependent decreases in systemic blood pressure and decreases in peripheral resistance. Hemodynamic and Electrophysiologic Effects Like other calcium antagonists, diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations. In the intact animal, prolongation of the AH interval can be seen at higher doses. In man, diltiazem prevents spontaneous and ergonovineprovoked coronary artery spasm. It causes a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a modest fall in blood pressure, and in exercise tolerance studies in patients with ischemic heart disease, reduces the heart rateblood pressure product for any given workload. Studies to date, primarily in patients with good ventricular function, have not revealed evidence of a negative inotropic effect cardiac output, ejection fraction, and left ventricular enddiastolic pressure have not been affected. There are as yet few data on the interaction of diltiazem and betablockers. Resting heart rate is usually unchanged or slightly reduced by diltiazem. Intravenous diltiazem in doses of 20 mg prolongs AH conduction time and AV node functional and effective refractory periods approximately 20. In a study involving single oral doses of 300 mg of diltiazem in six normal volunteers, the average maximum PR prolongation was 14 with no instances of greater than firstdegree AV block. Diltiazemassociated prolongation of the AH interval is not more pronounced in patients with firstdegree heart block. In patients with sick sinus syndrome, diltiazem significantly prolongs sinus cycle length (up to 50 in some cases). Chronic oral administration of diltiazem in doses of up to 240 mgday has resulted in small increases in PR interval but has not usually produced abnormal prolongation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Diltiazem is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is subject to an extensive firstpass effect, giving an absolute bioavailability (compared to intravenous dosing) of about 40. Diltiazem undergoes extensive metabolism in which 2 to 4 of the unchanged drug appears in the urine. In vitro binding studies show diltiazem is 70 to 80 bound to plasma proteins. Competitive in vitro ligand binding studies have also shown diltiazem binding is not altered by therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide, phenylbutazone, propranolol, salicylic acid, or warfarin. The plasma elimination halflife following single or multiple drug administration is approximately 3.0 to 4.5 hours. Desacetyl diltiazem is also present in the plasma at levels of 10 to 20 of the parent drug and is 25 to 50 as potent as a coronary vasodilator as diltiazem. Minimum therapeutic plasma levels of diltiazem appear to be in the range of 50 to 200 ngmL. There is a departure from linearity when dose strengths are increased. A study that compared patients with normal hepatic function to patients with cirrhosis found an increase in halflife and a 69 increase in AUC (areaundertheplasma concentration vs time curve) in the hepatically impaired patients. A single study in nine patients with severely impaired renal functions showed no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of diltiazem as compared to patients with normal renal function. Diltiazem Tablets Diltiazem is absorbed from the tablet formulation to about 98 of a reference solution. Single oral doses of 30 to 120 mg of diltiazem tablets result in detectable plasma levels within 30 to 60 minutes and peak plasma levels 2 to 4 hours after drug administration. As the dose of diltiazem tablets is increased from a daily dose of 120 mg (30 mg qid) to 240 mg (60 mg qid) daily, there is an increase in areaunderthecurve of 2.3 times. When the dose is increased from 240 mg to 360 mg daily, there is an increase in areaunderthecurve of 1.8 times.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE The oral LD50s in mice and rats range from 415 to 740 mgkg and from 560 to 810 mgkg, respectively. The intravenous LD50s in these species were 60 and 38 mgkg, respectively. The oral LD50 in dogs is considered to be in excess of 50 mgkg, while lethality was seen in monkeys at 360 mgkg. The toxic dose in man is not known. Due to extensive metabolism, blood levels after a standard dose of diltiazem can vary over tenfold, limiting the usefulness of blood levels in overdose cases. There have been reports of diltiazem overdose in amounts ranging from  1 g to 18 g. Of cases with known outcome, most patients recovered and in cases with a fatal outcome, the majority involved multiple drug ingestion. Events observed following diltiazem overdose included bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, and cardiac failure. Most reports of overdose described some supportive medical measure andor drug treatment. Bradycardia frequently responded favorably to atropine, as did heart block, although cardiac pacing was also frequently utilized to treat heart block. Fluids and vasopressors were used to maintain blood pressure, and in cases of cardiac failure, inotropic agents were administered. In addition, some patients received treatment with ventilatory support, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, andor intravenous calcium. The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases intravenous calcium has been administered (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate) over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia. In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that plasmapheresis or charcoal hemoperfusion may hasten diltiazem elimination following overdose. Based on the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem andor reported clinical experiences, the following measures may be considered Bradycardia Administer atropine (0.6 to 1 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously. HighDegree AV Block Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed highdegree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics. Hypotension Vasopressors (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine). Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Reproduction studies have been conducted in mice, rats, and rabbits. Administration of doses ranging from five to ten times greater (on a mgkg basis) than the daily recommended therapeutic dose has resulted in embryo and fetal lethality. These doses, in some studies, have been reported to cause skeletal abnormalities. In the perinatalpostnatal studies, there was some reduction in early individual pup weights and survival rates. There was an increased incidence of stillbirths at doses of 20 times the human dose or greater. There are no wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women therefore, use diltiazem in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, ampicillinclass antibiotics should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. Prescribing AMOXICILLIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drugresistant bacteria. Phenylketonurics The suspensions of AMOXICILLIN do not contain phenylalanine and can be used by phenylketonurics. Laboratory Tests As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic function should be made during prolonged therapy. All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis. Patients treated with amoxicillin should have a followup serologic test for syphilis after 3 months. Drug Interactions Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated in vitro however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented. In common with other antibiotics, AMOXICILLIN may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogenprogesterone contraceptives. DrugLaboratory Test Interactions High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in falsepositive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST, Benedicts Solution, or Fehlings Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriolglucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with amoxicillin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Longterm studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Studies to detect mutagenic potential of amoxicillin alone have not been conducted however, the following information is available from tests on a 41 mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate (AUGMENTIN).

AUGMENTIN was negative in the mouse micronucleus test, and in the dominant lethal assay in mice. Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test, and was negative in each of these assays. In a multigeneration reproduction study in rats, no impairment of fertility or other adverse reproductive effects were seen at doses up to 500 mgkg (approximately 3 times the human dose in mgm2). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 10 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillinclass antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pigs showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers Penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed. Dosing of AMOXICILLIN should be modified in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger ( 3 months). (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Neonates and Infants.) Geriatric Use An analysis of clinical studies of AMOXICILLIN was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects. Of the 1,811 subjects treated with capsules of AMOXICILLIN, 85 were 60 years old, 15 were 61 years old and 7 were 71 years old. This analysis and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Information for Patients AMOXICILLIN may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the strength of the product prescribed. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including AMOXICILLIN, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When AMOXICILLIN is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by AMOXICILLIN or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</td></tr>

NOTE SINCE PROBENECID IS CONTRAINDICATED IN CHILDREN UNDER 2 YEARS, DO NOT USE THIS REGIMEN IN THESE CASES. After reconstitution, the required amount of suspension should be placed directly on the childs tongue for swallowing. Alternate means of administration are to add the required amount of suspension to formula, milk, fruit juice, water, ginger ale, or cold drinks. These preparations should then be taken immediately. To be certain the child is receiving full dosage, such preparations should be consumed in entirety. All patients with gonorrhea should be evaluated for syphilis. (See PRECAUTIONS Laboratory Tests.) Larger doses may be required for stubborn or severe infections. General It should be recognized that in the treatment of chronic urinary tract infections, frequent bacteriological and clinical appraisals are necessary. Smaller doses than those recommended above should not be used. Even higher doses may be needed at times. In stubborn infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical andor bacteriological followup for several months after cessation of therapy. Except for gonorrhea, treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days treatment for any infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. H. pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Triple Therapy AMOXICILLINclarithromycinlansoprazole The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram AMOXICILLIN, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 30 mg lansoprazole, all given twice daily (q12h) for 14 days. (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE.) Dual Therapy AMOXICILLINlansoprazole The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram AMOXICILLIN and 30 mg lansoprazole, each given three times daily (q8h) for 14 days. (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE.) Please refer to clarithromycin and lansoprazole full prescribing information for CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS, and for information regarding dosing in elderly and renally impaired patients. Dosing Recommendations for Adults with Impaired Renal Function Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in dose unless the impairment is severe. Severely impaired patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 30 mLmin. should not receive the 875mg tablet. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mLmin. should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. Patients with a less than 10 mLmin. glomerular filtration rate should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose both during and at the end of dialysis. There are currently no dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with impaired renal function.

<tr><td><i>labor_and_delivery</i>:</td><td>Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillinclass antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pigs showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of penicillins Infections and Infestations Mucocutaneous candidiasis. Gastrointestinal Nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, diarrhea, black hairy tongue, and hemorrhagicpseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment. (See WARNINGS.) Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis (See WARNINGS.) Serum sicknesslike reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis and urticaria have been reported. NOTE These hypersensitivity reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is lifethreatening and amenable only to amoxicillin therapy. Liver A moderate rise in AST (SGOT) andor ALT (SGPT) has been noted, but the significance of these findings is unknown. Hepatic dysfunction including cholestatic jaundice, hepatic cholestasis and acute cytolytic hepatitis have been reported. Renal Crystalluria has also been reported (see OVERDOSAGE ). Hemic and Lymphatic Systems Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Central Nervous System Reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, convulsions, behavioral changes, andor dizziness have been reported rarely. Miscellaneous Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been rarely reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin and Lansoprazole In clinical trials using combination therapy with amoxicillin plus clarithromycin and lansoprazole, and amoxicillin plus lansoprazole, no adverse reactions peculiar to these drug combinations were observed. Adverse reactions that have occurred have been limited to those that had been previously reported with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, or lansoprazole. Triple Therapy AmoxicillinClarithromycinLansoprazole The most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received triple therapy were diarrhea (7), headache (6), and taste perversion (5). No treatmentemergent adverse events were observed at significantly higher rates with triple therapy than with any dual therapy regimen. Dual Therapy AmoxicillinLansoprazole The most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received amoxicillin three times daily plus lansoprazole three times daily dual therapy were diarrhea (8) and headache (7). No treatmentemergent adverse events were observed at significantly higher rates with amoxicillin three times daily plus lansoprazole three times daily dual therapy than with lansoprazole alone . For more information on adverse reactions with clarithromycin or lansoprazole, refer to their package inserts, ADVERSE REACTIONS.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>Information for Patients AMOXICILLIN may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the strength of the product prescribed. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including AMOXICILLIN, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When AMOXICILLIN is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by AMOXICILLIN or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>general_precautions</i>:</td><td>General The possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, ampicillinclass antibiotics should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. Prescribing AMOXICILLIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drugresistant bacteria.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS SERIOUS AND OCCASIONALLY FATAL HYPERSENSITIVITY (ANAPHYLACTIC) REACTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PATIENTS ON PENICILLIN THERAPY. ALTHOUGH ANAPHYLAXIS IS MORE FREQUENT FOLLOWING PARENTERAL THERAPY, IT HAS OCCURRED IN PATIENTS ON ORAL PENICILLINS. THESE REACTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN HYPERSENSITIVITY ANDOR A HISTORY OF SENSITIVITY TO MULTIPLE ALLERGENS. THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN HYPERSENSITIVITY WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE REACTIONS WHEN TREATED WITH CEPHALOSPORINS. BEFORE INITIATING THERAPY WITH AMOXICILLIN, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE CONCERNING PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO PENICILLINS, CEPHALOSPORINS, OR OTHER ALLERGENS. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION OCCURS, AMOXICILLIN SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AND APPROPRIATE THERAPY INSTITUTED. SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTIC REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE, OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including AMOXICILLIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Geriatric Use An analysis of clinical studies of AMOXICILLIN was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects. Of the 1,811 subjects treated with capsules of AMOXICILLIN, 85 were 60 years old, 15 were 61 years old and 7 were 71 years old. This analysis and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The effect of food on the absorption of amoxicillin from the tablets and suspension of AMOXICILLIN has been partially investigated. The 400mg and 875mg formulations have been studied only when administered at the start of a light meal. However, food effect studies have not been performed with the 200mg and 500mg formulations. Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. The halflife of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. In blood serum, amoxicillin is approximately 20 proteinbound. Orally administered doses of 250mg and 500mg amoxicillin capsules result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 3.5 mcgmL to 5.0 mcgmL and 5.5 mcgmL to 7.5 mcgmL, respectively. Mean amoxicillin pharmacokinetic parameters from an open, twopart, singledose crossover bioequivalence study in 27 adults comparing 875 mg of AMOXICILLIN with 875 mg of AUGMENTIN (amoxicillinclavulanate potassium) showed that the 875mg tablet of AMOXICILLIN produces an AUC0 of 35.4  8.1 mcghrmL and a Cmax of 13.8  4.1 mcgmL. Dosing was at the start of a light meal following an overnight fast. Orally administered doses of amoxicillin suspension, 125 mg5 mL and 250 mg5 mL, result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 1.5 mcgmL to 3.0 mcgmL and 3.5 mcgmL to 5.0 mcgmL, respectively. Oral administration of single doses of 400mg chewable tablets and 400 mg5 mL suspension of AMOXICILLIN to 24 adult volunteers yielded comparable pharmacokinetic data DoseAdministered at the start of a light meal. AUC0 (mcghrmL) Cmax (mcgmL)Mean values of 24 normal volunteers. Peak concentrations occurred approximately 1 hour after the dose. Amoxicillin Amoxicillin (S.D.) Amoxicillin (S.D.) 400 mg (5 mL of suspension) 17.1 (3.1) 5.92 (1.62) 400 mg (1 chewable tablet) 17.9 (2.4) 5.18 (1.64) Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin. Following a 1gram dose and utilizing a special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic, it was noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid. Approximately 60 of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. Microbiology Amoxicillin is similar to ampicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide. Amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. Aerobic GramPositive Microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus spp. (lactamasenegative strains only) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus spp. ( and hemolytic strains only) Staphylocci which are susceptible to amoxicillin but resistant to methicillinoxacillin should be considered as resistant to amoxicillin. Aerobic GramNegative Microorganisms Escherichia coli (lactamasenegative strains only) Haemophilus influenzae (lactamasenegative strains only) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (lactamasenegative strains only) Proteus mirabilis (lactamasenegative strains only) Helicobacter Helicobacter pylori Susceptibility Tests Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ampicillin powder. Ampicillin is sometimes used to predict susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to amoxicillin however, some intermediate strains have been shown to be susceptible to amoxicillin. Therefore, S. pneumoniae susceptibility should be tested using amoxicillin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria For GramPositive Aerobes Enterococcus MIC (mcgmL) Interpretation  8 Susceptible (S)  16 Resistant (R) Staphylococcus a MIC (mcgmL) Interpretation  0.25 Susceptible (S)  0.5 Resistant (R) Streptococcus (except S. pneumoniae) MIC (mcgmL) Interpretation  0.25 Susceptible (S) 0.5 to 4 Intermediate (I)  8 Resistant (R) S. Pneumoniae b from nonmeningitis sources. (Amoxicillin powder should be used to determine susceptibility.) MIC (mcgmL) Interpretation  2 Susceptible (S) 4 Intermediate (I)  8 Resistant (R) NOTE These interpretive criteria are based on the recommended doses for respiratory tract infections. For GramNegative Aerobes Enterobacteriaceae MIC (mcgmL) Interpretation  8 Susceptible (S) 16 Intermediate (I)  32 Resistant (R) H. influenzae c MIC (mcgmL) Interpretation  1 Susceptible (S) 2 Intermediate (I)  4 Resistant (R) a. Staphylococci which are susceptible to amoxicillin but resistant to methicillinoxacillin should be considered as resistant to amoxicillin. b. These interpretive standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests using cationadjusted MuellerHinton broth with 25 lysed horse blood. c. These interpretive standards are applicable only to broth microdilution test with H. influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM).1 A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone, which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard ampicillin powder should provide the following MIC values Microorganism MIC Range (mcgmL) E. coli ATCC 25922 2 to 8 E. faecalis ATCC 29212 0.5 to 2 H. influenzae ATCC 49247d 2 to 8 S. aureus ATCC 29213 0.25 to 1 Using amoxicillin to determine susceptibility Microorganism MIC Range (mcgmL) S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619e 0.03 to 0.12 d. This quality control range is applicable to only H. influenzae ATCC 49247 tested by a broth microdilution procedure using HTM.1 e. This quality control range is applicable to only S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 tested by the broth microdilution procedure using cationadjusted MuellerHinton broth with 25 lysed horse blood. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 10 mcg ampicillin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms, except S. pneumoniae, to amoxicillin. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for ampicillin. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard singledisk susceptibility test with a 10mcg ampicillin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria For GramPositive Aerobes Enterococcus Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation  17 Susceptible (S)  16 Resistant (R) Staphylococcus f Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation  29 Susceptible (S)  28 Resistant (R) hemolytic streptococci Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation  26 Susceptible (S) 19 to 25 Intermediate (I)  18 Resistant (R) NOTE For streptococci (other than hemolytic streptococci and S. pneumoniae), an ampicillin MIC should be determined. S. pneumoniae S. pneumoniae should be tested using a 1mcg oxacillin disk. Isolates with oxacillin zone sizes of  20 mm are susceptible to amoxicillin. An amoxicillin MIC should be determined on isolates of S. pneumoniae with oxacillin zone sizes of  19 mm. For GramNegative Aerobes Enterobacteriaceae Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation  17 Susceptible (S) 14 to 16 Intermediate (I)  13 Resistant (R) H. influenzae g Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation  22 Susceptible (S) 19 to 21 Intermediate (I)  18 Resistant (R) f. Staphylococci which are susceptible to amoxicillin but resistant to methicillinoxacillin should be considered as resistant to amoxicillin. g. These interpretive standards are applicable only to disk diffusion susceptibility tests with H. influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM).2 Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. As with standard dilution techniques, disk diffusion susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms. The 10mcg ampicillin disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains Microorganism Zone Diameter (mm) E. coli ATCC 25922 16 to 22 H. influenzae ATCC 49247h 13 to 21 S. aureus ATCC 25923 27 to 35 Using 1mcg oxacillin disk Microorganism Zone Diameter (mm) S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619i 8 to 12 h. This quality control range is applicable to only H. influenzae ATCC 49247 tested by a disk diffusion procedure using HTM.2 i. This quality control range is applicable to only S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 tested by a disk diffusion procedure using MuellerHinton agar supplemented with 5 sheep blood and incubated in 5 CO2. Susceptibility Testing for Helicobacter pylori In vitro susceptibility testing methods and diagnostic products currently available for determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and zone sizes have not been standardized, validated, or approved for testing H. pylori microorganisms. Culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained in patients who fail triple therapy. If clarithromycin resistance is found, a nonclarithromycincontaining regimen should be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL STUDIES H. pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Randomized, doubleblind clinical studies performed in the United States in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within 1 year) evaluated the efficacy of lansoprazole in combination with amoxicillin capsules and clarithromycin tablets as triple 14day therapy, or in combination with amoxicillin capsules as dual 14day therapy, for the eradication of H. pylori. Based on the results of these studies, the safety and efficacy of 2 different eradication regimens were established Triple Therapy Amoxicillin 1 gram twice dailyclarithromycin 500 mg twice dailylansoprazole 30 mg twice daily. Dual Therapy Amoxicillin 1 gram three times dailylansoprazole 30 mg three times daily. All treatments were for 14 days. H. pylori eradication was defined as 2 negative tests (culture and histology) at 4 to 6 weeks following the end of treatment. Triple therapy was shown to be more effective than all possible dual therapy combinations. Dual therapy was shown to be more effective than both monotherapies. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.

<tr><td><i>drug_and_or_laboratory_test_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugLaboratory Test Interactions High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in falsepositive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST, Benedicts Solution, or Fehlings Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriolglucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with amoxicillin.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. If the overdosage is very recent and there is no contraindication, an attempt at emesis or other means of removal of drug from the stomach may be performed. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poisoncontrol center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mgkg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms and do not require gastric emptying.3 Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin. Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria. Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin. Amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Initial Therapy In patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension not on diuretic therapy, the recommended initial dose is 10 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 20 to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose. The antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval regardless of the administered dose, but most commonly with a dose of 10 mg daily. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure just prior to dosing to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained for 24 hours. If it is not, an increase in dose should be considered. Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give greater effect. If blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets USP alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added. Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg has been shown to provide an additive effect. After the addition of a diuretic, it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril tablets USP. Diuretic Treated Patients In hypertensive patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension may occur occasionally following the initial dose of lisinopril tablets USP. The diuretic should be discontinued, if possible, for two to three days before beginning therapy with lisinopril tablets USP to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (seeWARNINGS). The dosage of lisinopril tablets USP should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. If the patientblood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets USP alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed as described above. If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (seeWARNINGSandPRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Concomitant administration of lisinopril tablets USP with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassiumsparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment The usual dose of lisinopril tablets USP (10 mg) is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance  30 mLmin (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mgdL). For patients with creatinine clearance10 mLmin30 mLmin (serum creatinine3 mgdL), the first dose is 5 mg once daily. For patients with creatinine clearance  10 mLmin (usually on hemodialysis) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum of 40 mg daily.  SeeWARNINGS, Anaphylactoid ReactionsDuring Membrane Exposure. Dosage or dosing interval should be adjusted depending on the blood pressure response.Renal StatusCreatinine Clearance mLminInitial Dose mgdayNormal renal function to mild impairment 3010Moderate to severe impairment10305Dialysis patients 102.5  Heart Failure Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy with diuretics and (usually) digitalis. The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day. When initiating treatment with lisinopril, USP in patients with heart failure, the initial dose should be administered under medical observation, especially in those patients with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg). The mean peak blood pressure lowering occurs six to eight hours after dosing. Observation should continue until blood pressure is stable. The concomitant diuretic dose should be reduced, if possible, to help minimize hypovolemia which may contribute to hypotension (seeWARNINGSandPRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of lisinopril tablets USP does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension. The usual effective dosage range is 5 to 40 mg per day administered as a single daily dose. The dose of lisinopril tablets USP can be increased by increments of no greater than 10 mg, at intervals of no less than 2 weeks to the highest tolerated dose, up to a maximum of 40 mg daily. Dose adjustment should be based on the clinical response of individual patients. Dosage Adjustment in Patients With Heart Failure and Renal Impairment or Hyponatremia In patients with heart failure who have hyponatremia (serum sodium  130 mEqL) or moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance30 mLmin or serum creatinine  3 mgdL), therapy with lisinopril tablets USP should be initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg once a day under close medical supervision (seeWARNINGSandPRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Acute Myocardial Infarction In hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, the first dose of lisinopril tablets USP is 5 mg given orally, followed by 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours and then 10 mg of lisinopril tablets USP once daily. Dosing should continue for six weeks. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin, and betablockers. Patients with a low systolic blood pressure (120 mmHg) when treatment is started or during the first 3 days after the infarct should be given a lower 2.5 mg oral dose of lisinopril tablets USP (seeWARNINGS). If hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure100 mmHg), a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg may be given with temporary reductions to 2.5 mg if needed. If prolonged hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure  90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) lisinopril tablets USP should be withdrawn. For patients who develop symptoms of heart failure, seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure. Dosage Adjustment in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Renal Impairment In acute myocardial infarction, treatment with lisinopril tablets USP should be initiated with caution in patients with evidence of renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine concentration exceeding 2 mgdL. No evaluation of dosing adjustments in myocardial infarction patients with severe renal impairment has been performed. Use in Elderly In general, the clinical response was similar in younger and older patients given similar doses of lisinopril tablets USP. Pharmacokinetic studies, however, indicate that maximum blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) are doubled in older patients, so that dosage adjustments should be made with particular caution. Pediatric Hypertensive Patients6 Years of Age The usual recommended starting dose is 0.07 mgkg once daily (up to 5 mg total). Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. Doses above 0.61 mgkg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in pediatric patients (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,PharmacokineticsandMetabolism and Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects). Lisinopril tablets USP are not recommended in pediatric patients  6 years or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate  30 mLmin1.73 m2 (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism and Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects andPRECAUTIONS). Preparation of Suspension (for 200 mL of a 1 mgmL Suspension) Add 10 mL of Purified Water USP to a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle containing ten 20 mg tablets of lisinopril tablets USP and shake for at least one minute. Add 30 mL of Bicitradiluent and 160 mL of OraSweet SFto the concentrate in the PET bottle and gently shake for several seconds to disperse the ingredients. The suspension should be stored at or below 25(77and can be stored for up to four weeks. Shake the suspension before each use.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Following a single oral dose of 20 gkg, no lethality occurred in rats, and death occurred in one of 20 mice receiving the same dose. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension, for which the usual treatment would be intravenous infusion of normal saline solution. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis (seeWARNINGS,AnaphylactoidReactions During Membrane Exposure).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lisinopril inhibits angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidly dispeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotension I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotension II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of lisinopril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system.Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassum. In hypertensive patiens with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEqL however, approximately 15 of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEqL and approximately 6 had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEqL and approximately 12 had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEqL (see PRECAUTIONS). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system,lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with lowrenin hypertension. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a lowrenin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than nonBlack patients. Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and nonBlack patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response were no longer evident. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Adult Patients Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about 7 hours, although there was a trend to a small delay in time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in acute myocardial infarction patients. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25, with large intersubject variability (6 to 60) at all doses tested (5 to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute bioavailability of lisinopril is reduced to 16 in patients with stable NYHA Class IIIV congestive heart failure, and the volume of distribution appears to be slightly smaller than that in normal subjects. The oral bioavailability of lisinopril in patients with acute myocardial infarction is similar to that in healthy volunteers. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective halflife of accumulation of 12 hours. Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mLmin. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination halflife is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the bloodbrain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14C lisinopril. By whole body autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between 6 years and 16 years with glomerular filtration rate  30 mLmin1.73 m2. After doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mgkg, steady state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within 6 hours and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28. These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults. The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearanceabsolute bioavailability) in a child weighing 30 kg is 10 Lh, which increases in proportion to renal function. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Hypertension Adult Patients Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume andor saltdepleted patients (seeWARNINGS). When given together with thiazidetype diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of the two drugs are approximately additive. In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by 6 hours. Although an antihypertensive effect was observed 24 hours after dosing with recommended single daily doses, the effect was more consistent and the mean effect was considerably larger in some studies with doses of 20 mg or more than with lower doses. However, at all doses studied, the mean antihypertensive effect was substantially smaller 24 hours after dosing than it was 6 hours after dosing. In some patients, achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy. The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril are maintained during longterm therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure, or a significant increase in blood pressure compared to pretreatment levels. Lisinopril had similar effectiveness and adverse effects in younger and older ( 65 years) patients. It was less effective in Blacks than in Caucasians. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large. In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (seePRECAUTIONS). Pediatric Patients In a clinical study involving 115 hypertensive pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who weighed  50 kg received either 0.625, 2.5, or 20 mg of lisinopril daily and patients who weighed50 kg received either 1.25, 5, or 40 mg of lisinopril daily. At the end of 2 weeks, lisinopril administered once daily lowered trough blood pressure in a dosedependent manner with consistent antihypertensive efficacy demonstrated at doses  1.25 mg (0.02 mgkg). This effect was confirmed in a withdrawal phase, where the diastolic pressure rose by about 9 mmHg more in patients randomized to placebo than it did in patients who were randomized to remain on the middle and high doses of lisinopril. The dosedependent antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was consistent across several demographic subgroups age, Tanner stage, gender, and race. In this study, lisinopril was generally welltolerated. In the above pediatric studies, lisinopril was given either as tablets or in a suspension for those children and infants who were unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Preparation of Suspension (for 200 mL of a 1 mgmL Suspension)). Heart Failure During baselinecontrolled clinical trials, in patients receiving digitalis and diuretics, single doses of lisinopril resulted in decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and no change in heart rate. In two placebo controlled, 12 week clinical studies using doses of lisinopril up to 20 mg, lisinopril as adjunctive therapy to digitalis and diuretics improved the following signs and symptoms due to congestive heart failure edema, rales, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and jugular venous distention. In one of the studies, beneficial response was also noted for orthopnea, presence of third heart sound and the number of patients classified as NYHA Class III and IV. Exercise tolerance was also improved in this study. The oncedaily dosing for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic response. A large (over 3000 patients) survival study, the ATLAS Trial, comparing 2.5 and 35 mg of lisinopril in patients with heart failure, showed that the higher dose of lisinopril had outcomes at least as favorable as the lower dose. Acute Myocardial Infarction The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienza nellMiocardico (GISSI3) study was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted in 19,394 patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to a coronary care unit. It was designed to examine the effects of shortterm (6 week) treatment with lisinopril, nitrates, their combination, or no therapy on shortterm (6 week) mortality and on longterm death and markedly impaired cardiac function. Patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms who were hemodynamically stable were randomized, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, to six weeks of either 1) lisinopril alone (n  4841), 2) nitrates alone (n  4869), 3) lisinopril plus nitrates (n  4841), or 4) open control (n  4843). All patients received routine therapies, including thrombolytics (72), aspirin (84), and a betablocker (31), as appropriate, normally utilized in acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients. The protocol excluded patients with hypotension (systolic blood pressure100 mmHg), severe heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine  2 mgdL andor proteinuria  500 mg24 h). Doses of lisinopril were adjusted as necessary according to protocol (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Study treatment was withdrawn at six weeks except where clinical conditions indicated continuation of treatment. The primary outcomes of the trial were the overall mortality at 6 weeks and a combined endpoint at 6 months after the myocardial infarction, consisting of the number of patients who died, had late (day 4) clinical congestive heart failure, or had extensive left ventricular damage defined as ejection fraction35 or an akineticdyskinetic AD score45. Patients receiving lisinopril (n  9646), alone or with nitrates, had an 11 lower risk of death (2p twotailed  0.04) compared to patients receiving no lisinopril (n  9672) (6.4 vs. 7.2, respectively) at six weeks. Although patients randomized to receive lisinopril for up to six weeks also fared numerically better on the combined endpoint at 6 months, the open nature of the assessment of heart failure, substantial loss to followup echocardiography, and substantial excess use of lisinopril between 6 weeks and 6 months in the group randomized to 6 weeks of lisinopril, preclude any conclusion about this endpoint. Patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with lisinopril, had a higher (9 vs. 3.7) incidence of persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure  90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) and renal dysfunction (2.4 vs. 1.1) inhospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mgdL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration) (seeADVERSE REACTIONS, Acute Myocardial Infarction).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including lisinopril) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis andor larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. This may occur at any time during treatment. ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in nonBlack patients. Lisinopril should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. Even in those instances where swelling of only the tongue is involved, without respiratory distress, patients may require prolonged observation since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient. Very rarely, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery.Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 11000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) andor measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided (seeADVERSE REACTIONS). Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angiodema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vimiting) in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angiedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see alsoINDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained lifethreatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Sudden and potentially lifethreatening anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in some patients dialyzed with highflux membranes (e.g., AN69) and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions must be initiated. Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing lowdensity lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Excessive hypotension is rare in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with lisinopril alone. Patients with heart failure given lisinopril commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, with peak blood pressure reduction occurring 6 to 8 hours post dose. Evidence from the twodose ATLAS trial suggested that incidence of hypotension may increase with the dose of lisinopril in heart failure patients. Discontinuation of thereapy because of the continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed caution should be observed when inititating thereapy DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients at risk of excessive hypotension, sometimes associated with oliguria andor progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure andor death, include those with the following conditions or characteristics heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, or severe volume andor salt depletion of any etiology. It may be advisable to eliminate the diuretic (except in patients with heart failure), reduce the diuretic dose or increase salt intake cautiously before initiating therapy with lisinopril in patients at risk for excessive hypotension who are able to tolerate such adjustments (seePRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, andADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients with acute myocardial infarction in the GISSI3 trial had a higher (9 vs. 3.7) incidence of persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure  90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) when treated with lisinopril. Treatment with lisinopril must not be initiated in acute myocardial infarction patients at risk of further serious hemodynamic deterioration after treatment with a vasodilator (e.g., systolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or lower) or cardiogenic shock. In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril andor diuretic is increased. Similar considerations may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease, or in patients with acute myocardial infarction, in whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses of lisinopril which usually can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. If symptomatic hypotension develops, a dose reduction or discontinuation of lisinopril or concomitant diuretic may be necessary. LeukopeniaNeutropeniaAgranulocytosis Another angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients but more frequently in patients with renal impairment especially if they also have a collagen vascular disease. Available data from clinical trials of lisinopril are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Marketing experience has revealed rare cases of leukopenianeutropenia and bone marrow depression in which a causal relationship to lisinopril cannot be excluded. Periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and renal disease should be considered. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice or hepatitis and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical followup. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the reninangiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue lisinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the reninangiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the reninangiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intraamniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue lisinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to lisinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (seePRECAUTIONS,Pediatric Use). No teratogenic effects of lisinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits. On a mgkg basis, the doses used were up to 625 times (in mice), 188 times (in rats), and 0.6 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.</td></tr>

Rash, photosensitivity or other dermatological manifestations may occur alone or in combination with these symptoms. Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving lisinopril with an incidence higher in Black than in nonBlack patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis andor larynx occurs, treatment with lisinopril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately (see WARNINGS). In rare cases, intestinal angioedema has been reported in postmarketing experience. Hypotension In hypertensive patients, hypotension occurred in 1.2 and syncope occurred in 0.1 of patients with an incidence higher in Black than in nonBlack patients. Hypotension or syncope was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in 0.5 of hypertensive patients. In patients with heart failure, hypotension occurred in 5.3 and syncope occurred in 1.8 of patients. These adverse experiences were possibly doserelated (see above data from ATLAS Trial) and caused discontinuation of therapy in 1.8 of these patients in the symptomatic trials. In patients treated with lisinopril for six weeks after acute myocardial infarction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure100 mmHg) resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 9.7 of the patients (seeWARNINGS). Cough SeePRECAUTIONS,Cough. Pediatric Patients No relevant differences between the adverse experience profile for pediatric patients and that previously reported for adult patients were identified. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia (seePRECAUTIONS), hyponatremia Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in about 2 of patients with essential hypertension treated with lisinopril alone. Increases were more common in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and in patients with renal artery stenosis (seePRECAUTIONS). Reversible minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in approximately 11.6 of patients with heart failure on concomitant diuretic therapy. Frequently, these abnormalities resolved when the dosage of the diuretic was decreased. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.4 G and 1.3 vol, respectively) occured frequently in patients treated with lisinopril but were rarely of clinical importance in patients without some other cause of anemia. In clinical trials, less than 0.1 of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Hemolytic anemia has been reported a casual relationship to lisinopril cannot be excluded. Liver Function Tests Rarely, elevations of liver enzymes andor serum bilirubin have occurred (seeWARNINGS, Hepatic Failure). In hypertensive patients, 2 discontinued therapy due to laboratory adverse experiences, principally elevations in blood urea nitrogen (0.6), serum creatinine (0.5) and serum potassium (0.4). In the heart faulure trials, 3.4 of patiens discontinued therapy due to laboratory adverse experience 1.8 due to elevations in blood ura nitrogen andor creatinine and 0.6 due to elevations in serum potassium. In the myocardial infarction trial, 2 of patients receiving lisinopril discontinued thereapy due to renal dysfunction (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mgdL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration) less than 1 of patients discontinued therapy due to other laboratory adverse experiences 0.1 with hyperkalemia and less than 0.1 with hepatic enzyme alterations.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Aortic StenosisHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy As with all vasodilators, lisinopril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the reninangiotensinaldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system, treatment with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be associated with oliguria andor progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure andor death. In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril andor diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some patients with hypertension or heart failure with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when lisinopril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction andor discontinuation of the diuretic andor lisinopril may be required. Patients with acute myocardial infarction in the GISSI3 trial treated with lisinopril had a higher (2.4 vs. 1.1) incidence of renal dysfunction inhospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mgdL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration). In acute myocardial infarction, treatment with lisinopril should be initiated with caution in patients with evidence of renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine concentration exceeding 2 mgdL. If renal dysfunction develops during treatment with lisinopril (serum creatinine concentration exceeding 3 mgdL or a doubling from the pretreatment value) then the physician should consider withdrawal of lisinopril. Evaluation of patients with hypertension, heart failure, or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5.7 mEqL) occurred in approximately 2.2 of hypertensive patients and 4.8 of patients with heart failure. In most cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Hyperkalemia was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in approximately 0.1 of hypertensive patients, 0.6 of patients with heart failure and 0.1 of patients with myocardial infarction. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassiumsparing diuretics, potassium supplements andor potassiumcontaining salt substitutes. Hyperkalemia can cause serious, sometimes fatal, arrhythmias. Lisinopril should be used cautiously, if at all, with these agents and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, almost always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitorinduced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. SurgeryAnesthesia In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, lisinopril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion. Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur at any time during treatment with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician. Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned to report lightheadedness especially during the first few days of therapy. If actual syncope occurs, the patient should be told to discontinue the drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician. All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. Other causes of volume depletion such as vimiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure patients should be advised to consult with their physician. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician. Hypoglycemia Diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin starting an ACE inhibitor should be told to closely monitor for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of combined use (seePRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). LeukopeniaNeutropenia Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever) which may be a sign of leukopenianeutropenia. Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to lisinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. NOTEAs with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated with lisinopril is warranted. This information is intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. Drug Interactions HypotensionPatients on Diuretic Therapy Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with lisinopril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with lisinopril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, initiate therapy with lisinopril at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized (seeWARNINGSandDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed. Studies with ACE inhibitors in combination with diuretics indicate that the dose of the ACE inhibitor can be reduced when it is given with a diuretic (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Antidiabetics Epidemiological studies have suggested that concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medicines (insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased bloodglucoselowering effect with risk of hypoglycemia. This phenomenon appeared to be more likely to occur during the first weeks of combined treatment and in patients with renal impairment. In diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, glycemic control should be closely monitored for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of treatment with an ACE inhibitor. NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase2 Inhibitors (COX2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volumedepleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Other Agents Lisinopril has been used concomitantly with nitrates andor digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. This included post myocardial infarction patients who were receiving intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin. No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazidetype diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassiumsparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassiumcontaining salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Potassiumsparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure who are receiving lisinopril. Lithium Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b> and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including lisinopril. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when lisinopril was administered for 105 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 90 mgkgday (about 56 or 9 times the maximum recommended daily human dose, based on body weight and body surface area, respectively). There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when lisinopril was administered for 92 weeks to (male and female) mice at doses up to 135 mgkgday (about 84 times the maximum recommended daily human dose). This dose was 6.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area in mice. Lisinopril was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation. It was also negative in a forward mutation assay using Chinese hamster lung cells. Lisinopril did not produce single strand DNA breaks in an in vitro alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay. In addition, lisinopril did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro test in Chinese hamster ovary cells or in an in vivo study in mouse bone marrow. There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance in male and female rats treated with up to 300 mgkgday of lisinopril. This dose is 188 times and 30 times the maximum human dose when based on mgkg and mgm2, respectively. Calculations assume a human weight of 50 kg and human body surface area of 1.62 m2. Nursing Mothers Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14C lisinopril. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ACE inhibitors, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue lisinopril, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to lisinopril If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension andor substituting for disordered renal function. Lisinopril, which crosses the placenta, has been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit, and theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion, although there is no experience with the latter procedure. Antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have been established in hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years. There are no data on the effect of lisinopril on blood pressure in pediatric patients under the age of 6 or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate  30 mLmin1.73 m2 (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokineticsand MetabolismandPharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects,andDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of lisinopril in patients with hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other clinical experience in this population has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In the ATLAS trial of lisinopril in patients with congestive heart failure, 1,596 (50) were 65 and over, while 437 (14) were 75 and over. In a clinical study of lisinopril in patients with myocardial infarctions, 4,413 (47) were 65 and over, while 1,656 (18) were 75 and over. In these studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients, and other reported clinical experiences have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Heart Failure and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Acute Myocardial Infarction). Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that maximum blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) are doubled in older patients (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. Evaluation of patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>INDICATIONS  USAGE Hypertension Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education ProgramJoint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Lisinopril tablets USP may be administered alone or with other antihypertensive agents. Heart Failure Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the management of heart failure in patients who are not responding adequately to diuretics and digitalis. Acute Myocardial Infarction Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction, to improve survival. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin and betablockers. In using lisinopril tablets USP, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril tablets USP do not have a similar risk (seeWARNINGS). In considering the use of lisinopril tablets USP, it should be noted that in controlled clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in Black patients than in nonBlacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in nonBlack patients (seeWARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 88104week carcinogenicity study in CD1 mice, rabeprazole at oral doses up to 100 mgkgday did not produce any increased tumor occurrence. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to rabeprazole (AUC) of 1.40 ghrmL which is 1.6 times the human exposure (plasma AUC  0.88 ghrmL) at the recommended dose for GERD (20 mgday). In a 28week carcinogenicity study in p53 transgenic mice, rabeprazole at oral doses of 20, 60, and 200 mgkgday did not cause an increase in the incidence rates of tumors but produced gastric mucosal hyperplasia at all doses. The systemic exposure to rabeprazole at 200 mgkgday is about 1724 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD. In a 104week carcinogenicity study in SpragueDawley rats, males were treated with oral doses of 5, 15, 30 and 60 mgkgday and females with 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 mgkgday. Rabeprazole produced gastric enterochromaffinlike (ECL) cell hyperplasia in male and female rats and ECL cell carcinoid tumors in female rats at all doses including the lowest tested dose. The lowest dose (5 mgkgday) produced a systemic exposure to rabeprazole (AUC) of about 0.1 ghrmL which is about 0.1 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD. In male rats, no treatment related tumors were observed at doses up to 60 mgkgday producing a rabeprazole plasma exposure (AUC) of about 0.2 ghrmL (0.2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD). 0  Rabeprazole was positive in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHOHGPRT) forward gene mutation test and the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178YTK) forward gene mutation test. Its demethylatedmetabolite was also positive in the Ames test. Rabeprazole was negative in the Chinese hamster lung cell chromosome aberration test, the mouse micronucleus test, and the and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) tests. in vitro in vivo in vivo ex vivo Rabeprazole at intravenous doses up to 30 mgkgday (plasma AUC of 8.8 ghrmL, about 10 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Risk Summary There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies with ACIPHEX in pregnant women. No evidence of teratogenicity was seen in animal reproduction studies with rabeprazole at 13 and 8 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD, in rats and rabbits, respectively. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Animal Data Embryofetal development studies have been performed in rats at intravenous doses of rabeprazole up to 50 mgkgday (plasma AUC of 11.8 ghrmL, about 13 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 30 mgkgday (plasma AUC of 7.3 ghrmL, about 8 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to rabeprazole. Administration of rabeprazole to rats in late gestation and during lactation at an oral dose of 400 mgkgday (about 195times the human oral dose based on mgm ) resulted in decreases in body weight gain of the pups. 2</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics ACIPHEX DelayedRelease Tablets and DelayedRelease granules in the capsule formulation are entericcoated to allow rabeprazole sodium, which is acid labile, to pass through the stomach relatively intact. After oral administration of 20 mg ACIPHEX tablet, peak plasma concentrations (C ) of rabeprazole occur over a range of 2.0 to 5.0 hours (T ). The rabeprazole C and AUC are linear over an oral dose range of 10 mg to 40 mg. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 40 mg are administered every 24 hours the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole is not altered by multiple dosing. max max max Absolute bioavailability for a 20 mg oral tablet of rabeprazole (compared to intravenous administration) is approximately 52. When ACIPHEX Tablets are administered with a high fat meal, T is variable which concomitant food intake may delay the absorption up to 4 hours or longer. However, the C and the extent of rabeprazole absorption (AUC) are not significantly altered. Thus ACIPHEX Tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals. Absorption max max After oral administration to healthy adults of 10 mg ACIPHEX granules sprinkled on applesauce under fasting condition, median time (T ) to peak plasma concentrations (C ) of rabeprazole was 2.5 hours and ranged 1.0 to 6.5 hours. The plasma halflife of rabeprazole ranges from 1 to 2 hours. max max In healthy adults, a concomitant high fat meal delayed the absorption of rabeprazole from ACIPHEX granules sprinkled on one Tablespoon of applesauce resulting in the median T of 4.5 hours and decreased the C and AUC on average by 55 and 33, respectively. ACIPHEX granules should be taken before a meal. max max last When 10 mg ACIPHEX granules administered under fasting conditions to healthy adults on one Tablespoon (15mL) of applesauce, one Tablespoon (15mL) of yogurt, or when mixed with a small amount (5mL) of liquid infant formula the type of soft food did not significantly affect T , C and AUC of rabeprazole. max max Rabeprazole is 96.3 bound to human plasma proteins. Distribution Rabeprazole is extensively metabolized. A significant portion of rabeprazole is metabolized via systemic nonenzymatic reduction to a thioether compound. Rabeprazole is also metabolized to sulphone and desmethyl compounds via cytochrome P450 in the liver. The thioether and sulphone are the primary metabolites measured in human plasma. These metabolites were not observed to have significant antisecretory activity. studies have demonstrated that rabeprazole is metabolized in the liver primarily by cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A) to a sulphone metabolite and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to desmethyl rabeprazole. CYP2C19 exhibits a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some subpopulations (e.g. 3 to 5 of Caucasians and 17 to 20 of Asians). Rabeprazole metabolism is slow in these subpopulations, therefore, they are referred to as poor metabolizers of the drug. Metabolism In vitro Following a single 20 mg oral dose of Clabeled rabeprazole, approximately 90 of the drug was eliminated in the urine, primarily as thioether carboxylic acid its glucuronide, and mercapturic acid metabolites. The remainder of the dose was recovered in the feces. Total recovery of radioactivity was 99.8. No unchanged rabeprazole was recovered in the urine or feces. Elimination 14 In 20 healthy elderly subjects administered 20 mg rabeprazole tablet once daily for seven days, AUC values approximately doubled and the C increased by 60 compared to values in a parallel younger control group. There was no evidence of drug accumulation after once daily administration  . Geriatric max see Use in Specific Population ( ) 8.5 The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole was studied in pediatric patients with GERD aged up to 16 years in four separate clinical studies. Pediatric Patients 12 to 16 Years of Age The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole was studied in 12 adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age, in a multicenter study. Patients received rabeprazole 20 mg tablets once daily for five or seven days. An approximate 40 increase in exposure was noted following 5 to 7 days of dosing compared with the exposure after 1 day dosing. Pharmacokinetic parameters in adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age were within the range observed in healthy adult volunteers. Patients 1 to 11 Years of Age In patients with GERD 1 to 11 years of age, following once daily administration of rabeprazole granules at doses from 0.14 to 1 mgkg, the median time to peak plasma concentration ranged 24 hours and the halflife was about 2.5 hour. No appreciable accumulation was noted following 5 days of dosing compared to exposure after a single dose. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, over the body weight range from 7 to 77.3 kg, the apparent rabeprazole clearance increased from 8.0 to 13.5 Lhr, an increase of 68.8. The mean estimated total exposure i.e. AUC after a 10 mg dose of ACIPHEX Sprinkle in patients with GERD 1 to 11 years of age is comparable to a 10 mg dose of ACIPHEX Tablets in adolescents and adults. Patients  1 Year Old See section Pediatric Use. 8.4 In analyses adjusted for body mass and height, rabeprazole pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences between male and female subjects. In studies that used different formulations of rabeprazole, AUC values for healthy Japanese men were approximately 5060 greater than values derived from pooled data from healthy men in the United States. Gender and Race 0 In 10 patients with stable endstage renal disease requiring maintenance hemodialysis (creatinine clearance 5 mLmin1.73 m ), no clinically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole after a single 20 mg oral dose when compared to 10 healthy volunteers  . Renal Disease 2 see Dosage and Administration ( ) 2.7 In a single dose study of 10 patients with chronic mild to moderate compensated cirrhosis of the liver who were administered a 20 mg dose of rabeprazole, AUC was approximately doubled, the elimination halflife was 2 to 3fold higher, and total body clearance was decreased to less than half compared to values in healthy men. Hepatic Disease 024 In a multiple dose study of 12 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment administered 20 mg rabeprazole once daily for eight days, AUC and C values increased approximately 20 compared to values in healthy age and gendermatched subjects. These increases were not statistically significant. 0 max No information exists on rabeprazole disposition in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Please refer to the for information on dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment. Dosage and Administration ( ) 2.7 Sixteen healthy volunteers genotyped as extensive metabolizers with respect to CYP2C19 were given 20 mg rabeprazole sodium, 1000 mg amoxicillin, 500 mg clarithromycin, or all 3 drugs in a fourway crossover study. Each of the four regimens was administered twice daily for 6 days. The AUC and C for clarithromycin and amoxicillin were not different following combined administration compared to values following single administration. However, the rabeprazole AUC and C increased by 11 and 34, respectively, following combined administration. The AUC and C for 14hydroxyclarithromycin (active metabolite of clarithromycin) also increased by 42 and 46, respectively. This increase in exposure to rabeprazole and 14hydroxyclarithromycin is not expected to produce safety concerns Combined Administration with Antimicrobials max max max Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. A study of healthy subjects including CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers receiving once daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg concomitantly with placebo or with ACIPHEX 20 mg (n36), for 7 days was conducted. The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 12 (mean AUC ratio was 88 , with 90 CI of 81.7 to 95.5) when ACIPHEX was coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel with placebo.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Increased INR and prothrombin times have been reported with concomitant use with warfarin. Patients need to be monitored ( ) 7.2 Rabeprazole has been shown to inhibit cyclosporine metabolism ( ) in vitro 7.3 ACIPHEX inhibits gastric acid secretion and may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin) ( ) 7.4 ACIPHEX may reduce the plasma levels of atazanavir ( ) 7.4 Methotrexate ACIPHEX may increase serum level of methotrexate ( ) 7.7 7.1 Drugs Metabolized by CYP450 Rabeprazole is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) drug metabolizing enzyme system. Studies in healthy subjects have shown that rabeprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP450 system, such as warfarin and theophylline given as single oral doses, diazepam as a single intravenous dose, and phenytoin given as a single intravenous dose (with supplemental oral dosing). Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system have not been studied in patients. 7.2 Warfarin There have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death  . see Warnings and Precautions ( ) 5.2 7.3 Cyclosporine incubations employing human liver microsomes indicated that rabeprazole inhibited cyclosporine metabolism with an IC of 62 micromolar, a concentration that is over 50 times higher than the C in healthy volunteers following 14 days of dosing with 20 mg of rabeprazole. This degree of inhibition is similar to that by omeprazole at equivalent concentrations. In vitro 50 max 7.4 Compounds Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption Rabeprazole produces sustained inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with compounds which are dependent on gastric pH for absorption may occur due to the magnitude of acid suppression observed with rabeprazole. For example, in normal subjects, coadministration of rabeprazole 20 mg QD resulted in an approximately 30 decrease in the bioavailability of ketoconazole and increases in the AUC and C for digoxin of 19 and 29, respectively. Therefore, patients may need to be monitored when such drugs are taken concomitantly with rabeprazole. Coadministration of rabeprazole and antacids produced no clinically relevant changes in plasma rabeprazole concentrations. max Concomitant use of atazanavir and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and thereby reduce its therapeutic effect. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C19 In a clinical study in Japan evaluating rabeprazole in adult patients categorized by CYP2C19 genotype (n6 per genotype category), gastric acid suppression was higher in poor metabolizers as compared to extensive metabolizers. This could be due to higher rabeprazole plasma levels in poor metabolizers. Whether or not interactions of rabeprazole sodium with other drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 would be different between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers has not been studied. 7.6 Combined Administration with Clarithromycin Combined administration consisting of rabeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin resulted in increases in plasma concentrations of rabeprazole and 14hydroxyclarithromycin  . see Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 12.3 Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions due to drug interactions  . Because of these drug interactions, clarithromycin is contraindicated for coadministration with certain drugs    . see Warnings and Precautions in prescribing information for clarithromycin see Contraindications in prescribing information for clarithromycin see Drug Interactions in prescribing information for amoxicillin 7.7 Methotrexate Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate andor its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted  . see Warnings and Precautions ( ) 5.6 7.8 Clopidogrel Concomitant administration of rabeprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically meaningful effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel  . No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of ACIPHEX. see Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 12.3</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.4 Pediatric Use Symptomatic GERD in Adolescent Patients Greater or Equal to 12 Years of Age In a multicenter, randomized, openlabel, parallelgroup study, 111 adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD, or suspected or endoscopically proven GERD were randomized and treated with either ACIPHEX 10 mg or ACIPHEX 20 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. The adverse event profile in adolescent patients was similar to that of adults. The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in 2 of patients were headache (5.4) and nausea (1.8). There were no adverse reactions reported in these studies that were not previously observed in adults. GERD in Pediatric Patients 1 to 11 Years of Age The use of ACIPHEX for treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age is supported by a randomized, multicenter, doubleblind clinical trial which evaluated two dose levels of rabeprazole in 127 pediatric patients with endoscopic and histologic evidence of GERD prior to study treatment. Dosing was determined by body weight patients weighing 6.0 to 14.9 kg received either 5 or 10 mg and those weighing 15.0 kg or more received 10 or 20 mg of ACIPHEX Sprinkle daily. After 12 weeks of rabeprazole treatment, 81 of patients demonstrated esophageal mucosal healing on endoscopic assessment. In patients who had esophageal mucosal healing at 12 weeks and elected to continue for 24 more weeks of rabeprazole, 90 retained esophageal mucosal healing at 36 weeks. No prespecified formal hypothesis testing for evaluation of efficacy was conducted. The absence of a placebo group does not allow assessment of sustained efficacy through 36 weeks. There were no adverse reactions reported in this study that were not previously observed in adolescents or adults. Symptomatic GERD in Infants 1 to 11 Months of Age Studies conducted do not support the use of ACIPHEX Sprinkle for the treatment of GERD in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age. In a randomized, multicenter, placebocontrolled withdrawal trial, infants 1 to 11 months of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD, or suspected or endoscopically proven GERD, were treated up to 8 weeks in two treatment periods. In the first treatment period (openlabel), 344 infants received 10 mg of ACIPHEX Sprinkle for up to 3 weeks. Infants with clinical response were then eligible to enter the second treatment period, which was doubleblind and randomized. Two hundred sixtyeight infants were randomized to receive either placebo or 5 mg or 10 mg ACIPHEX Sprinkle. This study did not demonstrate efficacy based on assessment of frequency of regurgitation and weightforage Zscore. Adverse reactions that occurred in 5 of patients in any treatment group and with a higher rate than placebo included pyrexia (7) and increased serum gastrin levels (5). There were no adverse reactions reported in this study that were not previously observed in adolescents and adults. Neonates 1 Month and Preterm Infants  44 Weeks Corrected Gestational Age Use of ACIPHEX Sprinkle in neonates is strongly discouraged at this time for the treatment of GERD, based on the risk of prolonged acid suppression and lack of demonstrated safety and effectiveness in neonates. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the median (range) for the apparent clearance (CLF) was 1.05 Lh (0.05433.44 Lh) in neonates and 4.46 Lh (0.82212.4 Lh) in patients 1 to 11 months of age following once daily administration of oral ACIPHEX Sprinkle.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Worldwide, over 2900 patients have been treated with rabeprazole in Phase IIIII clinical trials involving various dosages and durations of treatment. Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the adult studies (4 to 8 weeks), adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than 2 and greater than placebo included pain, pharyngitis, flatulence, infection and constipation ( ). 6.1 In studies of pediatric and adolescent patients (ages 1 to 16 years, and up to 36 weeks exposure) adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of 5 of patients included abdominal pain, diarrhea and headache ( ). 6.1 To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eisai Inc. at 18882742378 or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Adults The data described below reflect exposure to ACIPHEX in 1064 adult patients exposed for up to 8 weeks. The studies were primarily placebo and activecontrolled trials in adult patients with Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Duodenal Ulcers and Gastric Ulcers. The population had a mean age of 53 years (range 1889 years) and had a ratio of approximately 60 male 40 female. The racial distribution was 86 Caucasian, 8 African American, 2 Asian and 5 other. Most patients received either 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mgday of ACIPHEX. An analysis of adverse reactions appearing in 2 of ACIPHEX patients (n1064) and with a greater frequency than placebo (n89) in controlled North American and European acute treatment trials, revealed the following adverse reactions pain (3 vs. 1), pharyngitis (3 vs. 2), flatulence (3 vs. 1), infection (2 vs. 1), and constipation (2 vs. 1). Three longterm maintenance studies consisted of a total of 740 adult patients at least 54 of adult patients were exposed to rabeprazole for 6 months while at least 33 were exposed for 12 months. Of the 740 adult patients, 247 (33) and 241 (33) patients received 10 mg and 20 mg of ACIPHEX, respectively, while 169 (23) patients received placebo and 83 (11) received omeprazole. The safety profile of rabeprazole in the maintenance studies in adults was consistent with what was observed in the acute studies. Other adverse reactions seen in controlled clinical trials, which do not meet the above criteria (2 of ACIPHEX treated patients and greater than placebo) and for which there is a possibility of a causal relationship to rabeprazole, include the following headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dizziness, peripheral edema, hepatic enzyme increase, hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, myalgia, and arthralgia. In clinical trials using combination therapy with rabeprazole plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin (RAC), no adverse reactions unique to this drug combination were observed. In the U.S. multicenter study, the most frequently reported drug related adverse reactions for patients who received RAC therapy for 7 or 10 days were diarrhea (8 and 7) and taste perversion (6 and 10), respectively. Combination Treatment with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities particular to the drug combinations were observed. For more information on adverse reactions or laboratory changes with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their respective package prescribing information, section. Adverse Reactions Pediatric In a multicenter, openlabel study of adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD or endoscopically proven GERD, the adverse event profile was similar to that of adults. The adverse reactions reported without regard to relationship to ACIPHEX that occurred in 2 of 111 patients were headache (9.9), diarrhea (4.5), nausea (4.5), <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b> (3.6), and abdominal pain (3.6). The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in 2 of patients were headache (5.4) and nausea (1.8). There were no adverse reactions reported in this study that were not previously observed in adults. In a twopart, randomized, multicenter, doubleblind, parallelgroup study, 127 pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age with endoscopically proven GERD received either 5 mg or 10 mg (15 kg body weight) or 10 mg or 20 mg (15 kg body weight) rabeprazole. In this study, some patients were exposed to rabeprazole for 36 weeks. Adverse reactions that occurred in 5 of patients included abdominal pain (5), diarrhea (5), and headache (5). There were no adverse reactions reported in this study that were not previously observed in trials of adolescents and adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ACIPHEX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure sudden death coma, hyperammonemia jaundice rhabdomyolysis disorientation and delirium anaphylaxis angioedema bullous and other drug eruptions of the skin severe dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal), StevensJohnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme interstitial pneumonia interstitial nephritis TSH elevations bone fractures hypomagnesemia and associated diarrhea.

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in ACIPHEX (rabeprazole sodium) DelayedRelease Tablets and in ACIPHEX Sprinkle (rabeprazole sodium) DelayedRelease Capsules is rabeprazole sodium, which is a proton pump inhibitor. It is a substituted benzimidazole known chemically as 24(3methoxypropoxy)3methyl2pyridinylmethylsulfinyl1 benzimidazole sodium salt. It has an empirical formula of C H N NaO S and a molecular weight of 381.42. Rabeprazole sodium is a white to slightly yellowishwhite solid. It is very soluble in water and methanol, freely soluble in ethanol, chloroform and ethyl acetate and insoluble in ether and nhexane. The stability of rabeprazole sodium is a function of pH it is rapidly degraded in acid media, and is more stable under alkaline conditions.

The median inhibitory effect of ACIPHEX on 24 hour gastric acidity is 88 of maximal after the first dose. ACIPHEX 20 mg inhibits basal and peptone mealstimulated acid secretion versus placebo by 86 and 95, respectively, and increases the percent of a 24hour period that the gastric pH3 from 10 to 65 (see table below). This relatively prolonged pharmacodynamic action compared to the short pharmacokinetic halflife (12 hours) reflects the sustained inactivation of the H , K ATPase.

In this study, there were no statistically significant differences between doses however, there was a significant doserelated decrease in intragastric acidity. The ability of rabeprazole to cause a doserelated decrease in mean intragastric acidity is illustrated below.

After seven days of treatment, the percentage of time that esophageal pH4 decreased from baselines of 24.7 for 20 mg and 23.7 for 40 mg, to 5.1 and 2.0, respectively. Normalization of 24hour intraesophageal acid exposure was correlated to gastric pH4 for at least 35 of the 24hour period this level was achieved in 90 of subjects receiving ACIPHEX 20 mg and in 100 of subjects receiving ACIPHEX 40 mg. With ACIPHEX 20 mg and 40 mg per day, significant effects on gastric and esophageal pH were noted after one day of treatment, and more pronounced after seven days of treatment. Effects on Serum Gastrin In patients given daily doses of ACIPHEX for up to eight weeks to treat ulcerative or erosive esophagitis and in patients treated for up to 52 weeks to prevent recurrence of disease the median fasting gastrin level increased in a doserelated manner. The group median values stayed within the normal range. In a group of subjects treated daily with ACIPHEX 20 mg tablets for 4 weeks a doubling of mean serum gastrin concentrations were observed. Approximately 35 of these treated subjects developed serum gastrin concentrations above the upper limit of normal. In a study of CYP2C19 genotyped subjects in Japan, poor metabolizers developed statistically significantly higher serum gastrin concentrations than extensive metabolizers. Effects on Enterochromaffinlike (ECL) Cells Increased serum gastrin secondary to antisecretory agents stimulates proliferation of gastric ECL cells which, over time, may result in ECL cell hyperplasia in rats and mice and gastric carcinoids in rats, especially in females  . see Nonclinical Toxicology ( ) 13.1 In over 400 patients treated with ACIPHEX Tablets (10 or 20 mgday) for up to one year, the incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose, which is consistent with the pharmacological action of the protonpump inhibitor. No patient developed the adenomatoid, dysplastic or neoplastic changes of ECL cells in the gastric mucosa. No patient developed the carcinoid tumors observed in rats. Endocrine Effects Studies in humans for up to one year have not revealed clinically significant effects on the endocrine system. In healthy male volunteers treated with ACIPHEX for 13 days, no clinically relevant changes have been detected in the following endocrine parameters examined 17 estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroxinebinding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, folliclestimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin, somatotrophic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisolbinding globulin, and urinary 6hydroxycortisol, serum testosterone and circadian cortisol profile. Other Effects In humans treated with ACIPHEX for up to one year, no systemic effects have been observed on the central nervous, lymphoid, hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems. No data are available on longterm treatment with ACIPHEX and ocular effects. Microbiology The following data are available but the clinical significance is unknown. in vitro Rabeprazole sodium, amoxicillin and clarithromycin as a three drug regimen has been shown to be active against most strains of and in clinical infections as described in the ( ) and ( ) sections.

Incidence of AntibioticResistant Organisms Among Clinical Isolates Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rate (MIC  1 gmL) to was 9 (51 560) at baseline in all treatment groups combined. A total of  99 (558560) of patients had isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC  0.25 gmL) to amoxicillin at baseline.

Therefore, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done when possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated or susceptibility testing is not possible, alternative antimicrobial therapy should be instituted. H. pylori In the U.S. multicenter study, a total of 99 (558560) of patients had isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC  0.25 gmL) to amoxicillin at baseline. The other 2 patients had baseline isolates with an amoxicillin MIC of 0.5 gmL, and both isolates were clarithromycinresistant at baseline in one case the was eradicated. In the 7 and 10day treatment groups 75 (107145) and 79 (112142), respectively, of the patients who had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs ( 0.25 gmL) were eradicated of .

After oral administration of 20 mg ACIPHEX tablet, peak plasma concentrations (C ) of rabeprazole occur over a range of 2.0 to 5.0 hours (T ). The rabeprazole C and AUC are linear over an oral dose range of 10 mg to 40 mg. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 40 mg are administered every 24 hours the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole is not altered by multiple dosing. max max max Absolute bioavailability for a 20 mg oral tablet of rabeprazole (compared to intravenous administration) is approximately 52. When ACIPHEX Tablets are administered with a high fat meal, T is variable which concomitant food intake may delay the absorption up to 4 hours or longer. However, the C and the extent of rabeprazole absorption (AUC) are not significantly altered. Thus ACIPHEX Tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals. Absorption max max After oral administration to healthy adults of 10 mg ACIPHEX granules sprinkled on applesauce under fasting condition, median time (T ) to peak plasma concentrations (C ) of rabeprazole was 2.5 hours and ranged 1.0 to 6.5 hours. The plasma halflife of rabeprazole ranges from 1 to 2 hours. max max In healthy adults, a concomitant high fat meal delayed the absorption of rabeprazole from ACIPHEX granules sprinkled on one Tablespoon of applesauce resulting in the median T of 4.5 hours and decreased the C and AUC on average by 55 and 33, respectively. ACIPHEX granules should be taken before a meal. max max last When 10 mg ACIPHEX granules administered under fasting conditions to healthy adults on one Tablespoon (15mL) of applesauce, one Tablespoon (15mL) of yogurt, or when mixed with a small amount (5mL) of liquid infant formula the type of soft food did not significantly affect T , C and AUC of rabeprazole. max max Rabeprazole is 96.3 bound to human plasma proteins. Distribution Rabeprazole is extensively metabolized. A significant portion of rabeprazole is metabolized via systemic nonenzymatic reduction to a thioether compound. Rabeprazole is also metabolized to sulphone and desmethyl compounds via cytochrome P450 in the liver. The thioether and sulphone are the primary metabolites measured in human plasma. These metabolites were not observed to have significant antisecretory activity. studies have demonstrated that rabeprazole is metabolized in the liver primarily by cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A) to a sulphone metabolite and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to desmethyl rabeprazole. CYP2C19 exhibits a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some subpopulations (e.g. 3 to 5 of Caucasians and 17 to 20 of Asians). Rabeprazole metabolism is slow in these subpopulations, therefore, they are referred to as poor metabolizers of the drug. Metabolism In vitro Following a single 20 mg oral dose of Clabeled rabeprazole, approximately 90 of the drug was eliminated in the urine, primarily as thioether carboxylic acid its glucuronide, and mercapturic acid metabolites. The remainder of the dose was recovered in the feces. Total recovery of radioactivity was 99.8. No unchanged rabeprazole was recovered in the urine or feces. Elimination 14 In 20 healthy elderly subjects administered 20 mg rabeprazole tablet once daily for seven days, AUC values approximately doubled and the C increased by 60 compared to values in a parallel younger control group. There was no evidence of drug accumulation after once daily administration  . Geriatric max see Use in Specific Population ( ) 8.5 The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole was studied in pediatric patients with GERD aged up to 16 years in four separate clinical studies. Pediatric Patients 12 to 16 Years of Age The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole was studied in 12 adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age, in a multicenter study. Patients received rabeprazole 20 mg tablets once daily for five or seven days. An approximate 40 increase in exposure was noted following 5 to 7 days of dosing compared with the exposure after 1 day dosing. Pharmacokinetic parameters in adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age were within the range observed in healthy adult volunteers. Patients 1 to 11 Years of Age In patients with GERD 1 to 11 years of age, following once daily administration of rabeprazole granules at doses from 0.14 to 1 mgkg, the median time to peak plasma concentration ranged 24 hours and the halflife was about 2.5 hour. No appreciable accumulation was noted following 5 days of dosing compared to exposure after a single dose. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, over the body weight range from 7 to 77.3 kg, the apparent rabeprazole clearance increased from 8.0 to 13.5 Lhr, an increase of 68.8. The mean estimated total exposure i.e. AUC after a 10 mg dose of ACIPHEX Sprinkle in patients with GERD 1 to 11 years of age is comparable to a 10 mg dose of ACIPHEX Tablets in adolescents and adults. Patients  1 Year Old See section Pediatric Use. 8.4 In analyses adjusted for body mass and height, rabeprazole pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences between male and female subjects. In studies that used different formulations of rabeprazole, AUC values for healthy Japanese men were approximately 5060 greater than values derived from pooled data from healthy men in the United States. Gender and Race 0 In 10 patients with stable endstage renal disease requiring maintenance hemodialysis (creatinine clearance 5 mLmin1.73 m ), no clinically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole after a single 20 mg oral dose when compared to 10 healthy volunteers  . Renal Disease 2 see Dosage and Administration ( ) 2.7 In a single dose study of 10 patients with chronic mild to moderate compensated cirrhosis of the liver who were administered a 20 mg dose of rabeprazole, AUC was approximately doubled, the elimination halflife was 2 to 3fold higher, and total body clearance was decreased to less than half compared to values in healthy men. Hepatic Disease 024 In a multiple dose study of 12 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment administered 20 mg rabeprazole once daily for eight days, AUC and C values increased approximately 20 compared to values in healthy age and gendermatched subjects. These increases were not statistically significant. 0 max No information exists on rabeprazole disposition in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Please refer to the for information on dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment. Dosage and Administration ( ) 2.7 Sixteen healthy volunteers genotyped as extensive metabolizers with respect to CYP2C19 were given 20 mg rabeprazole sodium, 1000 mg amoxicillin, 500 mg clarithromycin, or all 3 drugs in a fourway crossover study. Each of the four regimens was administered twice daily for 6 days. The AUC and C for clarithromycin and amoxicillin were not different following combined administration compared to values following single administration. However, the rabeprazole AUC and C increased by 11 and 34, respectively, following combined administration. The AUC and C for 14hydroxyclarithromycin (active metabolite of clarithromycin) also increased by 42 and 46, respectively. This increase in exposure to rabeprazole and 14hydroxyclarithromycin is not expected to produce safety concerns Combined Administration with Antimicrobials max max max Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. A study of healthy subjects including CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers receiving once daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg concomitantly with placebo or with ACIPHEX 20 mg (n36), for 7 days was conducted. The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 12 (mean AUC ratio was 88 , with 90 CI of 81.7 to 95.5) when ACIPHEX was coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel with placebo.

For this and all studies of GERD healing, only patients with GERD symptoms and at least grade 2 esophagitis (modified HetzelDent grading scale) were eligible for entry. Endoscopic healing was defined as grade 0 or 1. Each rabeprazole dose was significantly superior to placebo in producing endoscopic healing after four and eight weeks of treatment. The percentage of patients demonstrating endoscopic healing was as follows TABLE 7 HEALING OF EROSIVE OR ULCERATIVE GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS HEALED (p0.001 versus placebo) Week 10 mg ACIPHEX QD N27 20 mg ACIPHEX QD N25 40 mg ACIPHEX QD N26 Placebo N25 4 63 56 54 0 8 93 84 85 12 In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the ACIPHEX 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg doses compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 regarding complete resolution of GERD heartburn frequency (p0.026). All ACIPHEX groups reported significantly greater rates of complete resolution of GERD daytime heartburn severity compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 (p0.036). Mean reductions from baseline in daily antacid dose were statistically significant for all ACIPHEX groups when compared to placebo at both Weeks 4 and 8 (p0.007).

Patients reported 5 or more periods of moderate to very severe heartburn during the placebo treatment phase the week prior to randomization. Patients were confirmed by endoscopy to have no esophageal erosions. The percentage of heartburn free daytime andor nighttime periods was greater with ACIPHEX 20 mg compared to placebo over the 4 weeks of study in Study RABUSA2 (47 vs. 23) and Study RABUSA3 (52 vs. 28). The mean decreases from baseline in average daytime and nighttime heartburn scores were significantly greater for ACIPHEX 20 mg as compared to placebo at week 4.

ACIPHEX was significantly superior to placebo in producing healing of duodenal ulcers. The percentages of patients with endoscopic healing are presented below TABLE 11 HEALING OF DUODENAL ULCERS PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS HEALED  p0.001 versus placebo Week ACIPHEX 20 mg QD N34 ACIPHEX 40 mg QD N33 Placebo N33 2 44 42 21 4 79 91 39 At Weeks 2 and 4, significantly more patients in the ACIPHEX 20 and 40 mg groups reported complete resolution of ulcer pain frequency (p0.018), daytime pain severity (p0.023), and nighttime pain severity (p0.035) compared with placebo patients. The only exception was the ACIPHEX 40 mg group versus placebo at Week 2 for duodenal ulcer pain frequency (p0.094). Significant differences in resolution of daytime and nighttime pain were noted in both ACIPHEX groups relative to placebo by the end of the first week of the study. Significant reductions in daily antacid use were also noted in both ACIPHEX groups compared to placebo at Weeks 2 and 4 (p0.001). An international randomized, doubleblind, activecontrolled trial was conducted in 205 patients comparing 20 mg ACIPHEX QD with 20 mg omeprazole QD. The study was designed to provide at least 80 power to exclude a difference of at least 10 between ACIPHEX and omeprazole, assuming fourweek healing response rates of 93 for both groups. In patients with endoscopically defined duodenal ulcers treated for up to four weeks, ACIPHEX was comparable to omeprazole in producing healing of duodenal ulcers.

Therapy consisted of rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (RAC) or omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (OAC). Patients with infection were stratified in a 11 ratio for those with peptic ulcer disease (active or a history of ulcer in the past five years) PUD and those who were symptomatic but without peptic ulcer disease NPUD, as determined by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The overall eradication rates, defined as negative CUBT for  6 weeks from the end of the treatment are shown in the following table. The eradication rates in the 7day and 10day RAC regimens were found to be similar to 10day OAC regimen using either the IntenttoTreat (ITT) or PerProtocol (PP) populations. Eradication rates in the RAC 3day regimen were inferior to the other regimens.

Patients who dropped out of the study due to an adverse event related to the study drug were included in the evaluable analysis as failures of therapy. Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented infection at baseline as defined above and took at least one dose of study medication. All dropouts were included as failures of therapy.

ACIPHEX produced satisfactory inhibition of gastric acid secretion in all patients and complete resolution of signs and symptoms of acidpeptic disease where present. ACIPHEX also prevented recurrence of gastric hypersecretion and manifestations of acidpeptic disease in all patients. The high doses of ACIPHEX used to treat this small cohort of patients with gastric hypersecretion were well tolerated. 14.7 Pediatric GERD Symptomatic GERD in Adolescents 12 to 16 Years of Age In a multicenter, randomized, openlabel, parallelgroup study, 111 adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD or suspected or endoscopically proven GERD were randomized and treated with either ACIPHEX 10 mg or ACIPHEX 20 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. GERD in Pediatric Patients 1 to 11 Years of Age The use of ACIPHEX Sprinkle in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age is supported by a twopart, multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, parallel 2 dose arms clinical trial which was conducted in 127 pediatric patients with endoscopic and histologic evidence of GERD prior to study treatment. Part 1 was 12 weeks in duration. Patients were randomized to one of two rabeprazole dose levels based on body weight. Patients weighing 6.0 to 14.9 kg received either 5 or 10 mg rabeprazole, and those with body weight  15 kg received either 10 or 20 mg of rabeprazole. Part 2 was a 24week doubleblinded extension of Part 1 (on same dose assigned in Part 1). Endoscopic evaluations were performed at 12 weeks (Part 1) and 36 weeks (Part 2) to assess esophageal healing. No prespecified formal hypothesis testing was conducted. For Part 1, rates of endoscopic healing were calculated and are shown in Table 14.

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Studies conducted do not support the use of ACIPHEX or the treatment of GERD in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age ( ). 8.4 The safety and efficacy of ACIPHEX for the other adult indications have not been established for pediatric patients ( ). 8.4 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Risk Summary There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies with ACIPHEX in pregnant women. No evidence of teratogenicity was seen in animal reproduction studies with rabeprazole at 13 and 8 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD, in rats and rabbits, respectively. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Animal Data Embryofetal development studies have been performed in rats at intravenous doses of rabeprazole up to 50 mgkgday (plasma AUC of 11.8 ghrmL, about 13 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 30 mgkgday (plasma AUC of 7.3 ghrmL, about 8 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to rabeprazole. Administration of rabeprazole to rats in late gestation and during lactation at an oral dose of 400 mgkgday (about 195times the human oral dose based on mgm ) resulted in decreases in body weight gain of the pups. 2 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if ACIPHEX is excreted in human milk however, rabeprazole is present in rat milk. Because many drugs are excreted in milk, caution should be exercised when ACIPHEX is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Symptomatic GERD in Adolescent Patients Greater or Equal to 12 Years of Age In a multicenter, randomized, openlabel, parallelgroup study, 111 adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD, or suspected or endoscopically proven GERD were randomized and treated with either ACIPHEX 10 mg or ACIPHEX 20 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. The adverse event profile in adolescent patients was similar to that of adults. The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in 2 of patients were headache (5.4) and nausea (1.8). There were no adverse reactions reported in these studies that were not previously observed in adults. GERD in Pediatric Patients 1 to 11 Years of Age The use of ACIPHEX for treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age is supported by a randomized, multicenter, doubleblind clinical trial which evaluated two dose levels of rabeprazole in 127 pediatric patients with endoscopic and histologic evidence of GERD prior to study treatment. Dosing was determined by body weight patients weighing 6.0 to 14.9 kg received either 5 or 10 mg and those weighing 15.0 kg or more received 10 or 20 mg of ACIPHEX Sprinkle daily. After 12 weeks of rabeprazole treatment, 81 of patients demonstrated esophageal mucosal healing on endoscopic assessment. In patients who had esophageal mucosal healing at 12 weeks and elected to continue for 24 more weeks of rabeprazole, 90 retained esophageal mucosal healing at 36 weeks. No prespecified formal hypothesis testing for evaluation of efficacy was conducted. The absence of a placebo group does not allow assessment of sustained efficacy through 36 weeks. There were no adverse reactions reported in this study that were not previously observed in adolescents or adults. Symptomatic GERD in Infants 1 to 11 Months of Age Studies conducted do not support the use of ACIPHEX Sprinkle for the treatment of GERD in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age. In a randomized, multicenter, placebocontrolled withdrawal trial, infants 1 to 11 months of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD, or suspected or endoscopically proven GERD, were treated up to 8 weeks in two treatment periods. In the first treatment period (openlabel), 344 infants received 10 mg of ACIPHEX Sprinkle for up to 3 weeks. Infants with clinical response were then eligible to enter the second treatment period, which was doubleblind and randomized. Two hundred sixtyeight infants were randomized to receive either placebo or 5 mg or 10 mg ACIPHEX Sprinkle. This study did not demonstrate efficacy based on assessment of frequency of regurgitation and weightforage Zscore. Adverse reactions that occurred in 5 of patients in any treatment group and with a higher rate than placebo included pyrexia (7) and increased serum gastrin levels (5). There were no adverse reactions reported in this study that were not previously observed in adolescents and adults. Neonates 1 Month and Preterm Infants  44 Weeks Corrected Gestational Age Use of ACIPHEX Sprinkle in neonates is strongly discouraged at this time for the treatment of GERD, based on the risk of prolonged acid suppression and lack of demonstrated safety and effectiveness in neonates. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the median (range) for the apparent clearance (CLF) was 1.05 Lh (0.05433.44 Lh) in neonates and 4.46 Lh (0.82212.4 Lh) in patients 1 to 11 months of age following once daily administration of oral ACIPHEX Sprinkle. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ACIPHEX, 19 were 65 years and over, while 4 were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Gender Duodenal ulcer and erosive esophagitis healing rates in women are similar to those in men. Adverse reactions and laboratory test abnormalities in women occurred at rates similar to those in men.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 88104week carcinogenicity study in CD1 mice, rabeprazole at oral doses up to 100 mgkgday did not produce any increased tumor occurrence. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to rabeprazole (AUC) of 1.40 ghrmL which is 1.6 times the human exposure (plasma AUC  0.88 ghrmL) at the recommended dose for GERD (20 mgday). In a 28week carcinogenicity study in p53 transgenic mice, rabeprazole at oral doses of 20, 60, and 200 mgkgday did not cause an increase in the incidence rates of tumors but produced gastric mucosal hyperplasia at all doses. The systemic exposure to rabeprazole at 200 mgkgday is about 1724 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD. In a 104week carcinogenicity study in SpragueDawley rats, males were treated with oral doses of 5, 15, 30 and 60 mgkgday and females with 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 mgkgday. Rabeprazole produced gastric enterochromaffinlike (ECL) cell hyperplasia in male and female rats and ECL cell carcinoid tumors in female rats at all doses including the lowest tested dose. The lowest dose (5 mgkgday) produced a systemic exposure to rabeprazole (AUC) of about 0.1 ghrmL which is about 0.1 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD. In male rats, no treatment related tumors were observed at doses up to 60 mgkgday producing a rabeprazole plasma exposure (AUC) of about 0.2 ghrmL (0.2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD). 0  Rabeprazole was positive in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHOHGPRT) forward gene mutation test and the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178YTK) forward gene mutation test. Its demethylatedmetabolite was also positive in the Ames test. Rabeprazole was negative in the Chinese hamster lung cell chromosome aberration test, the mouse micronucleus test, and the and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) tests. in vitro in vivo in vivo ex vivo Rabeprazole at intravenous doses up to 30 mgkgday (plasma AUC of 8.8 ghrmL, about 10 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. 13.2 Animal Toxicology andor Pharmacology Studies in juvenile and young adult rats and dogs were performed. In juvenile animal studies rabeprazole sodium was administered orally to rats for up to 5 weeks and to dogs for up to 13 weeks, each commencing on Day 7 postpartum and followed by a 13week recovery period. Rats were dosed at 5, 25 or 150 mgkgday and dogs were dosed at 3, 10 or 30 mgkgday. The data from these studies were comparable to those reported for young adult animals. Pharmacologically mediated changes, including increased serum gastrin levels and stomach changes, were observed at all dose levels in both rats and dogs. These observations were reversible over the 13week recovery periods. Although body weights andor crownrump lengths were minimally decreased during dosing, no effects on the development parameters were noted in either juvenile rats or dogs.</td></tr>

The maximum reported overdose was 80 mg. There were no clinical signs or symptoms associated with any reported overdose. Patients with ZollingerEllison syndrome have been treated with up to 120 mg rabeprazole QD. No specific antidote for rabeprazole is known. Rabeprazole is extensively protein bound and is not readily dialyzable. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a Poison Control Center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug. Single oral doses of rabeprazole at 786 mgkg and 1024 mgkg were lethal to mice and rats, respectively. The single oral dose of 2000 mgkg was not lethal to dogs. The major symptoms of acute toxicity were hypoactivity, labored respiration, lateral or prone position and convulsion in mice and rats and watery diarrhea, tremor, convulsion and coma in dogs.</td></tr>

After seven days of treatment, the percentage of time that esophageal pH4 decreased from baselines of 24.7 for 20 mg and 23.7 for 40 mg, to 5.1 and 2.0, respectively. Normalization of 24hour intraesophageal acid exposure was correlated to gastric pH4 for at least 35 of the 24hour period this level was achieved in 90 of subjects receiving ACIPHEX 20 mg and in 100 of subjects receiving ACIPHEX 40 mg. With ACIPHEX 20 mg and 40 mg per day, significant effects on gastric and esophageal pH were noted after one day of treatment, and more pronounced after seven days of treatment. Effects on Serum Gastrin In patients given daily doses of ACIPHEX for up to eight weeks to treat ulcerative or erosive esophagitis and in patients treated for up to 52 weeks to prevent recurrence of disease the median fasting gastrin level increased in a doserelated manner. The group median values stayed within the normal range. In a group of subjects treated daily with ACIPHEX 20 mg tablets for 4 weeks a doubling of mean serum gastrin concentrations were observed. Approximately 35 of these treated subjects developed serum gastrin concentrations above the upper limit of normal. In a study of CYP2C19 genotyped subjects in Japan, poor metabolizers developed statistically significantly higher serum gastrin concentrations than extensive metabolizers. Effects on Enterochromaffinlike (ECL) Cells Increased serum gastrin secondary to antisecretory agents stimulates proliferation of gastric ECL cells which, over time, may result in ECL cell hyperplasia in rats and mice and gastric carcinoids in rats, especially in females  . see Nonclinical Toxicology ( ) 13.1 In over 400 patients treated with ACIPHEX Tablets (10 or 20 mgday) for up to one year, the incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose, which is consistent with the pharmacological action of the protonpump inhibitor. No patient developed the adenomatoid, dysplastic or neoplastic changes of ECL cells in the gastric mucosa. No patient developed the carcinoid tumors observed in rats. Endocrine Effects Studies in humans for up to one year have not revealed clinically significant effects on the endocrine system. In healthy male volunteers treated with ACIPHEX for 13 days, no clinically relevant changes have been detected in the following endocrine parameters examined 17 estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroxinebinding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, folliclestimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin, somatotrophic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisolbinding globulin, and urinary 6hydroxycortisol, serum testosterone and circadian cortisol profile. Other Effects In humans treated with ACIPHEX for up to one year, no systemic effects have been observed on the central nervous, lymphoid, hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems. No data are available on longterm treatment with ACIPHEX and ocular effects. Microbiology The following data are available but the clinical significance is unknown. in vitro Rabeprazole sodium, amoxicillin and clarithromycin as a three drug regimen has been shown to be active against most strains of and in clinical infections as described in the ( ) and ( ) sections. Helicobacter pylori in vitro Clinical Studies 14 Indications and Usage 1 Helicobacter pylori Susceptibility testing of isolates was performed for amoxicillin and clarithromycin using agar dilution methodology , and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined.

Incidence of AntibioticResistant Organisms Among Clinical Isolates Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rate (MIC  1 gmL) to was 9 (51 560) at baseline in all treatment groups combined. A total of  99 (558560) of patients had isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC  0.25 gmL) to amoxicillin at baseline.

Therefore, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done when possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated or susceptibility testing is not possible, alternative antimicrobial therapy should be instituted. H. pylori In the U.S. multicenter study, a total of 99 (558560) of patients had isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC  0.25 gmL) to amoxicillin at baseline.

Patients with healed GERD were treated for up to 40 months with rabeprazole and monitored with serial gastric biopsies. Patients without infection (221 of 326 patients) had no clinically important pathologic changes in the gastric mucosa. Patients with infection at baseline (105 of 326 patients) had mild or moderate inflammation in the gastric body or mild inflammation in the gastric antrum. Patients with mild grades of infection or inflammation in the gastric body tended to change to moderate, whereas those graded moderate at baseline tended to remain stable. Patients with mild grades of infection or inflammation in the gastric antrum tended to remain stable. At baseline 8 of patients had atrophy of glands in the gastric body and 15 had atrophy in the gastric antrum. At endpoint, 15 of patients had atrophy of glands in the gastric body and 11 had atrophy in the gastric antrum. Approximately 4 of patients had intestinal metaplasia at some point during followup, but no consistent changes were seen. H. pylori H. pylori 5.2 Concomitant Use with Warfarin Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and warfarin have not been adequately evaluated in patients. There have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 5.3 Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like ACIPHEX may be associated with an increased risk of associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve  . Clostridium difficile see Adverse Reactions ( ) 6.2 Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with ACIPHEX, refer to and sections of those package inserts. Clostridium difficile Warnings Precautions 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies in adults suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosisrelated fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received highdose, defined as multiple daily doses, and longterm PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosisrelated fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines  and . see Dosage and Administration ( ) 2 Adverse Reactions ( ) 6.2 5.5 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically  . see Adverse Reactions ( ) 6.2 5.6 Concomitant Use of ACIPHEX with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate andor its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In highdose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients  . see Drug Interactions ( ) 7.7</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Fluticasone propionate demonstrated no tumorigenic potential in mice at oral doses up to 1,000 mcgkg (approximately 2 and 10 times the MRHDID for adults and children aged 4 to 11 years, respectively, on a mgm2 basis) for 78 weeks or in rats at inhalation doses up to 57 mcgkg (approximately 0.2 times and approximately equivalent to the MRHDID for adults and children aged 4 to 11 years, respectively, on a mgm2 basis) for 104 weeks. Fluticasone propionate did not induce gene mutation in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells in vitro. No significant clastogenic effect was seen in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. No evidence of impairment of fertility was observed in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcgkg (approximately 0.2 times the MRHDID for adults on a mgm2 basis). Prostate weight was significantly reduced.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials with FLOVENT DISKUS in pregnant women. Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, FLOVENT DISKUS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Women should be advised to contact their physicians if they become pregnant while taking FLOVENT DISKUS. Mice and rats at fluticasone propionate doses approximately 0.1 and 0.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID) for adults (on a mgm2 basis at maternal subcutaneous doses of 45 and 100 mcgkgday, respectively) showed fetal toxicity characteristic of potent corticosteroid compounds, including embryonic growth retardation, omphalocele, cleft palate, and retarded cranial ossification. No teratogenicity was seen in rats at doses up to 0.3 times the MRHDID (on a mgm2 basis at maternal inhaled doses up to 68.7 mgkgday). In rabbits, fetal weight reduction and cleft palate were observed at a fluticasone propionate dose approximately 0.03 times the MRHDID for adults (on a mgm2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcgkgday). However, no teratogenic effects were reported at fluticasone propionate doses up to approximately 2 times the MRHDID for adults (on a mgm2 basis at a maternal oral dose up to 300 mcgkgday). No fluticasone propionate was detected in the plasma in this study, consistent with the established low bioavailability following oral administration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. Experience with oral corticosteroids since their introduction in pharmacologic, as opposed to physiologic, doses suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. In addition, because there is a natural increase in corticosteroid production during pregnancy, most women will require a lower exogenous corticosteroid dose and many will not need corticosteroid treatment during pregnancy. Nonteratogenic Effects Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born of mothers receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Such infants should be carefully monitored.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (1), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of fluticasone propionate from the DISKUS inhaler in healthy volunteers averages 7.8. Peak steadystate fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in adult subjects with asthma (N  11) ranged from undetectable to 266 pgmL after a 500mcg twicedaily dose of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using the DISKUS inhaler. The mean fluticasone propionate plasma concentration was 110 pgmL. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 Lkg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mLmin), with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02 of the total. The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 12,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Elimination Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination halflife of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5 of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Special Populations Gender Full pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from 9 female and 16 male subjects given 500 mcg twice daily. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics were observed. Pediatrics In a clinical trial conducted in subjects aged 4 to 11 years with mild to moderate asthma, fluticasone propionate concentrations were obtained in 61 subjects at 20 and 40 minutes after dosing with 50 and 100 mcg twice daily of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using the DISKUS. Plasma concentrations were low and ranged from undetectable (about 80 of the plasma samples) to 88 pgmL. Mean peak fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations at the 50 and 100mcg dose levels were 5 and 8 pgmL, respectively. Hepatic and Renal Impairment Formal pharmacokinetic studies using FLOVENT DISKUS have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. Drug Interactions Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Ritonavir Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multipledose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (10 pgmL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (Cmax) averaged 11.9 pgmL (range 10.8 to 14.1 pgmL) and AUC(0) averaged 8.43 pghmL (range 4.2 to 18.8 pghmL). Fluticasone propionate Cmax and AUC(0) increased to 318 pgmL (range 110 to 648 pgmL) and 3,102.6 pghmL (range 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pghmL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole In a placebocontrolled, crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Following orally inhaled fluticasone propionate alone, AUC(2last) averaged 1.559 nghmL (range 0.555 to 2.906 nghmL) and AUC(2) averaged 2.269 nghmL (range 0.836 to 3.707 nghmL). Fluticasone propionate AUC(2last) and AUC(2) increased to 2.781 nghmL (range 2.489 to 8.486 nghmL) and 4.317 nghmL (range 3.256 to 9.408 nghmL), respectively, after coadministration of ketoconazole with orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This increase in plasma fluticasone propionate concentration resulted in a decrease (45) in serum cortisol AUC. Erythromycin In a multipledose drug interaction trial, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg 3 times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole) Use not recommended. May increase risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (7.1) 7.1 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with FLOVENT DISKUS is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur. Ritonavir A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushings syndrome and adrenal suppression. Ketoconazole Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45 decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC), but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of FLOVENT DISKUS in children aged 4 years and older have been established see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2). The safety and effectiveness of FLOVENT DISKUS in children younger than 4 years have not been established. Effects on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. A reduction of growth velocity in children or teenagers may occur as a result of poorly controlled asthma or from use of corticosteroids, including inhaled corticosteroids. The effects of longterm treatment of children and adolescents with inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, on final adult height are not known. Controlled clinical trials have shown that inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth in pediatric patients. In these trials, the mean reduction in growth velocity was approximately 1 cmyear (range 0.3 to 1.8 cmyear) and appeared to depend upon dose and duration of exposure. This effect was observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The longterm effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with orally inhaled corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for catchup growth following discontinuation of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The effects on growth velocity of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids for over 1 year, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The growth of children and adolescents receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including FLOVENT DISKUS, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks associated with alternative therapies. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including FLOVENT DISKUS, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls hisher symptoms. A 52week placebocontrolled trial to assess the potential growth effects of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (FLOVENT ROTADISK) at 50 and 100 mcg twice daily was conducted in the US in 325 prepubescent children (244 males and 81 females) aged 4 to 11 years. The mean growth velocities at 52 weeks observed in the intenttotreat population were 6.32 cmyear in the placebo group (n  76), 6.07 cmyear in the 50mcg group (n  98), and 5.66 cmyear in the 100mcg group (n  89). An imbalance in the proportion of children entering puberty between groups and a higher dropout rate in the placebo group due to poorly controlled asthma may be confounding factors in interpreting these data. A separate subset analysis of children who remained prepubertal during the trial revealed growth rates at 52 weeks of 6.10 cmyear in the placebo group (n  57), 5.91 cmyear in the 50mcg group (n  74), and 5.67 cmyear in the 100mcg group (n  79). In children aged 8.5 years, the mean age of children in this trial, the range for expected growth velocity is boys  3rd percentile  3.8 cmyear, 50th percentile  5.4 cmyear, and 97th percentile  7.0 cmyear girls  3rd percentile  4.2 cmyear, 50th percentile  5.7 cmyear, and 97th percentile  7.3 cmyear. The clinical relevance of these growth data is not certain.</td></tr>

Less than 2 of subjects discontinued from the trials because of adverse reactions. The average duration of exposure was 73 to 79 days in the active treatment groups compared with 56 days in the placebo group. Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions not previously listed, whether considered drugrelated or not by the investigators, that were reported more frequently by subjects with asthma treated with FLOVENT DISKUS compared with subjects treated with placebo include the following palpitations soft tissue injuries contusions and hematomas wounds and lacerations burns poisoning and toxicity pressureinduced disorders hoarsenessdysphonia epistaxis ear, nose, throat, and tonsil signs and symptoms ear, nose, and throat polyps allergic ear, nose, and throat disorders throat constriction fluid disturbances weight gain appetite disturbances keratitis and conjunctivitis blepharoconjunctivitis gastrointestinal signs and symptoms oral ulcerations dental discomfort and pain oral erythema and rashes mouth and tongue disorders oral discomfort and pain tooth decay cholecystitis arthralgia and articular rheumatism muscle cramps and spasms musculoskeletal inflammation dizziness sleep disorders migraines paralysis of cranial nerves edema and swelling bacterial infections fungal infections mobility disorders mood disorders bacterial reproductive infections photodermatitis dermatitis and dermatosis viral skin infections eczema pruritus acne and folliculitis urinary infections. Three (3) of the 7 placebocontrolled US clinical trials were pediatric trials. A total of 592 subjects aged 4 to 11 years were treated with FLOVENT DISKUS (dosages of 50 or 100 mcg twice daily) or placebo an additional 174 subjects aged 4 to 11 years received FLOVENT ROTADISK (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder) at the same doses. There were no clinically relevant differences in the pattern or severity of adverse events in children compared with those reported in adults. In the first 16 weeks of a 52week clinical trial in adult subjects with asthma who previously required oral corticosteroids (daily doses of 5 to 40 mg oral prednisone), the effects of FLOVENT DISKUS 500 mcg twice daily (n  41) and 1,000 mcg twice daily (n  36) were compared with placebo (n  34) for the frequency of reported adverse events. The average duration of exposure for subjects taking FLOVENT DISKUS was 105 days compared with 75 days for placebo. Adverse events, whether or not considered drug related by the investigators, reported in more than 5 subjects in the group taking FLOVENT DISKUS and that occurred more frequently with FLOVENT DISKUS than with placebo are shown below (percent FLOVENT DISKUS and percent placebo). Ear, Nose, and Throat Hoarsenessdysphonia (9 and 0), nasal congestionblockage (16 and 0), oral candidiasis (31 and 21), rhinitis (13 and 9), sinusitissinus infection (33 and 12), throat irritation (10 and 9), and upper respiratory tract infection (31 and 24).

Skin Pruritus (6 and 0) and skin rashes (8 and 3). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of fluticasone propionate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone propionate or a combination of these factors. Ear, Nose, and Throat Aphonia, facial and oropharyngeal edema, and throat soreness. Endocrine and Metabolic Cushingoid features, growth velocity reduction in childrenadolescents, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis. Eye Cataracts. Immune System Disorders Immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, rash, angioedema, and bronchospasm, have been reported. Anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy have been reported. Infections and Infestations Esophageal candidiasis. Psychiatry Agitation, aggression, anxiety, depression, and restlessness. Behavioral changes, including hyperactivity and irritability, have been reported very rarely and primarily in children.

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDAapproved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Local Effects Inform patients that localized infections with Candida albicans occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, treat it with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing therapy with FLOVENT DISKUS, but at times therapy with FLOVENT DISKUS may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Rinsing the mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation is advised to help reduce the risk of thrush. Status Asthmaticus and Acute Asthma Symptoms Inform patients that FLOVENT DISKUS is not a bronchodilator and is not intended for use as rescue medicine for acute asthma exacerbations. Advise patients to treat acute asthma symptoms with an inhaled, shortacting beta2agonist such as albuterol. Instruct patients to contact their physicians immediately if there is deterioration of their asthma. Immunosuppression Warn patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physicians without delay. Inform patients of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections or ocular herpes simplex. Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression Advise patients that FLOVENT DISKUS may cause systemic corticosteroid effects of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. Additionally, inform patients that deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids. Patients should taper slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to FLOVENT DISKUS. Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Advise patients that immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of FLOVENT DISKUS. Patients should discontinue FLOVENT DISKUS if such reactions occur. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of powder products containing lactose therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not take FLOVENT DISKUS. Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Advise patients who are at an increased risk for decreased BMD that the use of corticosteroids may pose an additional risk. Reduced Growth Velocity Inform patients that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including FLOVENT DISKUS, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Physicians should closely follow the growth of children and adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route. Ocular Effects Longterm use of inhaled corticosteroids may increase the risk of some eye problems (cataracts or glaucoma) consider regular eye examinations. Use Daily for Best Effect Patients should use Flovent DISKUS at regular intervals as directed. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief and the full benefit may not be achieved until treatment has been administered for 1 to 2 weeks or longer. Patients should not increase the prescribed dosage but should contact their physicians if symptoms do not improve or if the condition worsens. Instruct patients not to stop use of FLOVENT DISKUS abruptly. Patients should contact their physicians immediately if they discontinue use of FLOVENT DISKUS.

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION The active component of FLOVENT DISKUS 50 mcg, FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg, and FLOVENT DISKUS 250 mcg is fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid having the chemical name S(fluoromethyl) 6,9difluoro11,17dihydroxy16methyl3oxoandrosta1,4diene17carbothioate, 17propionate and the following chemical structure Fluticasone propionate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 500.6, and the empirical formula is C25H31F3O5S. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol and 95 ethanol. FLOVENT DISKUS is an orange plastic inhaler containing a foil blister strip. Each blister on the strip contains a white powder mix of micronized fluticasone propionate (50, 100, or 250 mcg) in 12.5 mg of formulation containing lactose monohydrate (which contains milk proteins). After the inhaler is activated, the powder is dispersed into the airstream created by the patient inhaling through the mouthpiece. Under standardized in vitro test conditions, FLOVENT DISKUS delivers 46, 94, and 229 mcg of fluticasone propionate from FLOVENT DISKUS 50 mcg, FLOVENT DISKUS 100 mcg, and FLOVENT DISKUS 250 mcg, respectively, when tested at a flow rate of 60 Lmin for 2 seconds. In adult subjects with obstructive lung disease and severely compromised lung function (mean FEV1 20 to 30 of predicted), mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the DISKUS inhaler was 82.4 Lmin (range 46.1 to 115.3 Lmin). In children with asthma aged 4 and 8 years, mean PIF through FLOVENT DISKUS was 70 and 104 Lmin, respectively (range 48 to 123 Lmin). The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as inspiratory flow profile. Chemical structure</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Flovent DISKUS should be administered by the orally inhaled route only in patients aged 4 years and older. After inhalation, the patient should rinse hisher mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. After asthma stability has been achieved, it is always desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dosage after 2 weeks of therapy, higher dosages may provide additional asthma control. The safety and efficacy of FLOVENT DISKUS when administered in excess of recommended dosages have not been established. The recommended starting dosage and the highest recommended dosage of FLOVENT DISKUS, based on prior asthma therapy, are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Recommended Dosages of FLOVENT DISKUS NOTE In all patients, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage once asthma stability is achieved. Previous Therapy Recommended Starting Dosage Highest Recommended Dosage Adult and adolescent patients (aged 12 years and older) Bronchodilators alone 100 mcg twice daily 500 mcg twice daily Inhaled corticosteroids 100250 mcg twice dailya 500 mcg twice daily Oral corticosteroidsb 5001,000 mcg twice dailyc 1,000 mcg twice daily Pediatric patients (aged 411 years) d 50 mcg twice dailya 100 mcg twice daily aStarting dosages above 100 mcg twice daily for adult and adolescent patients and 50 mcg twice daily for pediatric patients aged 4 to 11 years may be considered for patients with poorer asthma control or those who have previously required doses of inhaled corticosteroids that are in the higher range for the specific agent. bFor patients currently receiving chronic oral corticosteroid therapy, prednisone should be reduced no faster than 2.5 to 5 mgday on a weekly basis beginning after at least 1 week of therapy with FLOVENT DISKUS. Patients should be carefully monitored for signs of asthma instability, including serial objective measures of airflow, and for signs of adrenal insufficiency see Warnings and Precautions (5.4). Once prednisone reduction is complete, the dosage of FLOVENT DISKUS should be reduced to the lowest effective dosage. cThe choice of starting dosage should be made on the basis of individual patient assessment. A controlled clinical trial of 111 oral corticosteroiddependent subjects with asthma showed few significant differences between the 2 doses of FLOVENT DISKUS on safety and efficacy endpoints. However, inability to decrease the dose of oral corticosteroids further during corticosteroid reduction may be indicative of the need to increase the dose of fluticasone propionate up to the maximum of 1,000 mcg twice daily. dBecause individual responses may vary, pediatric patients previously maintained on other inhaled corticosteroids may require dosage adjustments upon transfer to FLOVENT DISKUS. For oral inhalation only. Dosing is based on prior asthma therapy.

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with antiinflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone17monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer. Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical antiinflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local antiinflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic bioavailability (1), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the only metabolite detected in man.</td></tr>

This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local antiinflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic bioavailability (1), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the only metabolite detected in man. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using dosages up to and including 250 mcg twice daily, occasional abnormal short cosyntropin tests (peak serum cortisol 18 mcgdL assessed by radioimmunoassay) were noted both in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and in subjects receiving placebo. The incidence of abnormal tests at 500 mcg twice daily was greater than placebo. In a 2year trial carried out with the DISKHALER inhalation device in 64 subjects with mild, persistent asthma (mean FEV1 91 of predicted) randomized to fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily or placebo, no subject receiving fluticasone propionate had an abnormal response to 6hour cosyntropin infusion (peak serum cortisol 18 mcgdL). With a peak cortisol threshold of 35 mcgdL, 1 subject receiving fluticasone propionate (4) had an abnormal response at 1 year repeat testing at 18 months and 2 years was normal. Another subject receiving fluticasone propionate (5) had an abnormal response at 2 years. No subject on placebo had an abnormal response at 1 or 2 years. In a placebocontrolled clinical trial conducted in subjects aged 4 to 11 years, a 30minute cosyntropin stimulation test was performed in 41 subjects after 12 weeks of dosing with 50 or 100 mcg twice daily of fluticasone propionate via the DISKUS inhaler. One subject receiving fluticasone propionate via the DISKUS inhaler had a prestimulation plasma cortisol concentration 5 mcgdL, and 2 subjects had a rise in cortisol of 7 mcgdL. However, all poststimulation values were 18 mcgdL. The potential systemic effects of inhaled fluticasone propionate on the HPA axis were also studied in subjects with asthma. Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation aerosol at dosages of 220, 440, 660, or 880 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo or oral prednisone 10 mg given once daily for 4 weeks. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by 6hour cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with inhaled fluticasone propionate treatment. No subject had an abnormal response (peak serum cortisol 18 mcgdL) after dosing with placebo or fluticasone propionate 220 mcg twice daily. For subjects treated with 440, 660, and 880 mcg twice daily, 10, 16, and 12, respectively, had an abnormal response as compared with 29 of subjects treated with prednisone. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (1), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of fluticasone propionate from the DISKUS inhaler in healthy volunteers averages 7.8. Peak steadystate fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations in adult subjects with asthma (N  11) ranged from undetectable to 266 pgmL after a 500mcg twicedaily dose of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using the DISKUS inhaler. The mean fluticasone propionate plasma concentration was 110 pgmL. Distribution Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 Lkg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mLmin), with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02 of the total. The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 12,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. Elimination Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination halflife of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5 of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Special Populations Gender Full pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from 9 female and 16 male subjects given 500 mcg twice daily. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics were observed. Pediatrics In a clinical trial conducted in subjects aged 4 to 11 years with mild to moderate asthma, fluticasone propionate concentrations were obtained in 61 subjects at 20 and 40 minutes after dosing with 50 and 100 mcg twice daily of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using the DISKUS. Plasma concentrations were low and ranged from undetectable (about 80 of the plasma samples) to 88 pgmL. Mean peak fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations at the 50 and 100mcg dose levels were 5 and 8 pgmL, respectively. Hepatic and Renal Impairment Formal pharmacokinetic studies using FLOVENT DISKUS have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. Drug Interactions Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Ritonavir Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multipledose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (10 pgmL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (Cmax) averaged 11.9 pgmL (range 10.8 to 14.1 pgmL) and AUC(0) averaged 8.43 pghmL (range 4.2 to 18.8 pghmL). Fluticasone propionate Cmax and AUC(0) increased to 318 pgmL (range 110 to 648 pgmL) and 3,102.6 pghmL (range 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pghmL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86) in serum cortisol AUC. Ketoconazole In a placebocontrolled, crossover trial in 8 healthy adult volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Following orally inhaled fluticasone propionate alone, AUC(2last) averaged 1.559 nghmL (range 0.555 to 2.906 nghmL) and AUC(2) averaged 2.269 nghmL (range 0.836 to 3.707 nghmL). Fluticasone propionate AUC(2last) and AUC(2) increased to 2.781 nghmL (range 2.489 to 8.486 nghmL) and 4.317 nghmL (range 3.256 to 9.408 nghmL), respectively, after coadministration of ketoconazole with orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This increase in plasma fluticasone propionate concentration resulted in a decrease (45) in serum cortisol AUC. Erythromycin In a multipledose drug interaction trial, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg 3 times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult and Adolescent Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Four randomized, doubleblind, parallelgroup, placebocontrolled, US clinical trials were conducted in 1,036 adult and adolescent subjects (aged 12 years and older) with asthma to assess the efficacy and safety of FLOVENT DISKUS in the treatment of asthma. Fixed dosages of 100, 250, and 500 mcg twice daily were compared with placebo to provide information about appropriate dosing to cover a range of asthma severity. Subjects in these trials included those inadequately controlled with bronchodilators alone and those already maintained on daily inhaled corticosteroids. All doses were delivered by inhalation of the contents of 1 or 2 blisters from FLOVENT DISKUS twice daily. Figures 1 through 4 display results of pulmonary function tests (mean percent change from baseline in FEV1 prior to AM dose) for 3 recommended dosages of FLOVENT DISKUS (100, 250, and 500 mcg twice daily) and placebo from the four 12week trials in adolescents and adults. These trials used predetermined criteria for lack of efficacy (indicators of worsening asthma), resulting in withdrawal of more patients in the placebo group. Therefore, pulmonary function results at Endpoint (the last evaluable FEV1 result, including most patients lung function data) are also displayed. Pulmonary function, as determined by percent change from baseline in FEV1 at recommended dosages of FLOVENT DISKUS improved significantly compared with placebo by the first week of treatment, and improvement was maintained for up to 1 year or more.

A 12Week Clinical Trial Evaluating FLOVENT DISKUS 500 mcg Twice Daily in Adults and Adolescents Receiving Inhaled Corticosteroids or Bronchodilators Alone In all 4 efficacy trials, measures of pulmonary function (FEV1) were statistically significantly improved as compared with placebo at all twicedaily doses. Subjects on all dosages of FLOVENT DISKUS were also less likely to discontinue study participation due to asthma deterioration (as defined by predetermined criteria for lack of efficacy including lung function and subjectrecorded variables such as AM PEF, albuterol use, and nighttime awakenings due to asthma) compared with placebo. In a clinical trial of 111 subjects with severe asthma requiring chronic oral prednisone therapy (average baseline daily prednisone dose was 14 mg), fluticasone propionate given by inhalation powder at doses of 500 and 1,000 mcg twice daily was evaluated. Both doses enabled a statistically significantly larger percentage of subjects to wean from oral prednisone as compared with placebo (75 of the subjects on 500 mcg twice daily and 89 of the subjects on 1,000 mcg twice daily as compared with 9 of subjects on placebo). Accompanying the reduction in oral corticosteroid use, subjects treated with fluticasone propionate had significantly improved lung function and fewer asthma symptoms as compared with the placebo group.

A 12Week Clinical Trial Evaluating FLOVENT DISKUS 500 mcg Twice Daily in Adolescents and Adults Receiving Inhaled Corticosteroids or Bronchodilators Alone 14.2 Pediatric Subjects Aged 4 to 11 Years A 12week, placebocontrolled clinical trial was conducted in 437 pediatric subjects (177 received FLOVENT DISKUS), approximately half of whom were receiving inhaled corticosteroids at baseline. In this trial, doses of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 50 and 100 mcg twice daily significantly improved FEV1 (15 and 18 change from baseline at Endpoint, respectively) compared with placebo (7 change). AM PEF was also significantly improved with doses of fluticasone propionate 50 and 100 mcg twice daily (26 and 27 change from baseline at Endpoint, respectively) compared with placebo (14 change). In this trial, subjects on active treatment were significantly less likely to discontinue treatment due to asthma deterioration (as defined by predetermined criteria for lack of efficacy including lung function and subjectrecorded variables such as AM PEF, albuterol use, and nighttime awakenings due to asthma). Two other 12week placebocontrolled clinical trials were conducted in 504 pediatric subjects with asthma, approximately half of whom were receiving inhaled corticosteroids at baseline. In these trials, FLOVENT DISKUS was efficacious at doses of 50 and 100 mcg twice daily when compared with placebo on major endpoints including lung function and symptom scores. Pulmonary function improved significantly compared with placebo by the first week of treatment, and subjects treated with FLOVENT DISKUS were also less likely to discontinue trial participation due to asthma deterioration. One hundred ninetytwo (192) subjects received FLOVENT DISKUS for up to 1 year during an openlabel extension. Data from this openlabel extension suggested that lung function improvements could be maintained up to 1 year.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Monitor patients for signs of increased drug exposure. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled trials with FLOVENT DISKUS in pregnant women. Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, FLOVENT DISKUS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Women should be advised to contact their physicians if they become pregnant while taking FLOVENT DISKUS. Mice and rats at fluticasone propionate doses approximately 0.1 and 0.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID) for adults (on a mgm2 basis at maternal subcutaneous doses of 45 and 100 mcgkgday, respectively) showed fetal toxicity characteristic of potent corticosteroid compounds, including embryonic growth retardation, omphalocele, cleft palate, and retarded cranial ossification. No teratogenicity was seen in rats at doses up to 0.3 times the MRHDID (on a mgm2 basis at maternal inhaled doses up to 68.7 mgkgday). In rabbits, fetal weight reduction and cleft palate were observed at a fluticasone propionate dose approximately 0.03 times the MRHDID for adults (on a mgm2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcgkgday). However, no teratogenic effects were reported at fluticasone propionate doses up to approximately 2 times the MRHDID for adults (on a mgm2 basis at a maternal oral dose up to 300 mcgkgday). No fluticasone propionate was detected in the plasma in this study, consistent with the established low bioavailability following oral administration see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. Experience with oral corticosteroids since their introduction in pharmacologic, as opposed to physiologic, doses suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. In addition, because there is a natural increase in corticosteroid production during pregnancy, most women will require a lower exogenous corticosteroid dose and many will not need corticosteroid treatment during pregnancy. Nonteratogenic Effects Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born of mothers receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Such infants should be carefully monitored. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether fluticasone propionate is excreted in human breast milk. However, other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. Subcutaneous administration to lactating rats of tritiated fluticasone propionate at a dose approximately 0.04 times the MRHDID for adults on a mgm2 basis resulted in measurable radioactivity in milk. Since there are no data from controlled trials on the use of FLOVENT DISKUS by nursing mothers, caution should be exercised when FLOVENT DISKUS is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of FLOVENT DISKUS in children aged 4 years and older have been established see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2). The safety and effectiveness of FLOVENT DISKUS in children younger than 4 years have not been established. Effects on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. A reduction of growth velocity in children or teenagers may occur as a result of poorly controlled asthma or from use of corticosteroids, including inhaled corticosteroids. The effects of longterm treatment of children and adolescents with inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, on final adult height are not known. Controlled clinical trials have shown that inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth in pediatric patients. In these trials, the mean reduction in growth velocity was approximately 1 cmyear (range 0.3 to 1.8 cmyear) and appeared to depend upon dose and duration of exposure. This effect was observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The longterm effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with orally inhaled corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for catchup growth following discontinuation of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The effects on growth velocity of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids for over 1 year, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The growth of children and adolescents receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including FLOVENT DISKUS, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks associated with alternative therapies. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including FLOVENT DISKUS, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls hisher symptoms. A 52week placebocontrolled trial to assess the potential growth effects of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (FLOVENT ROTADISK) at 50 and 100 mcg twice daily was conducted in the US in 325 prepubescent children (244 males and 81 females) aged 4 to 11 years. The mean growth velocities at 52 weeks observed in the intenttotreat population were 6.32 cmyear in the placebo group (n  76), 6.07 cmyear in the 50mcg group (n  98), and 5.66 cmyear in the 100mcg group (n  89). An imbalance in the proportion of children entering puberty between groups and a higher dropout rate in the placebo group due to poorly controlled asthma may be confounding factors in interpreting these data. A separate subset analysis of children who remained prepubertal during the trial revealed growth rates at 52 weeks of 6.10 cmyear in the placebo group (n  57), 5.91 cmyear in the 50mcg group (n  74), and 5.67 cmyear in the 100mcg group (n  79). In children aged 8.5 years, the mean age of children in this trial, the range for expected growth velocity is boys  3rd percentile  3.8 cmyear, 50th percentile  5.4 cmyear, and 97th percentile  7.0 cmyear girls  3rd percentile  4.2 cmyear, 50th percentile  5.7 cmyear, and 97th percentile  7.3 cmyear. The clinical relevance of these growth data is not certain. 8.5 Geriatric Use Safety data have been collected on 280 subjects (FLOVENT DISKUS n  83, FLOVENT Rotadisk n  197) aged 65 years and older and 33 subjects (FLOVENT DISKUS n  14, FLOVENT ROTADISK n  19) aged 75 years and older who have been treated with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder in US and nonUS clinical trials. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Formal pharmacokinetic studies using FLOVENT DISKUS have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. 8.7 Renal Impairment Formal pharmacokinetic studies using FLOVENT DISKUS have not been conducted in patients with renal impairment.</td></tr>

Fluticasone propionate did not induce gene mutation in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells in vitro. No significant clastogenic effect was seen in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. No evidence of impairment of fertility was observed in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcgkg (approximately 0.2 times the MRHDID for adults on a mgm2 basis).

Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation aerosol at dosages of 1,320 mcg twice daily for 7 to 15 days to healthy human volunteers was also well tolerated. Repeat oral doses up to 80 mg daily for 10 days in healthy volunteers and repeat oral doses up to 20 mg daily for 42 days in subjects were well tolerated. Adverse reactions were of mild or moderate severity, and incidences were similar in active and placebo treatment groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder using dosages up to and including 250 mcg twice daily, occasional abnormal short cosyntropin tests (peak serum cortisol 18 mcgdL assessed by radioimmunoassay) were noted both in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and in subjects receiving placebo. The incidence of abnormal tests at 500 mcg twice daily was greater than placebo. In a 2year trial carried out with the DISKHALER inhalation device in 64 subjects with mild, persistent asthma (mean FEV1 91 of predicted) randomized to fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily or placebo, no subject receiving fluticasone propionate had an abnormal response to 6hour cosyntropin infusion (peak serum cortisol 18 mcgdL). With a peak cortisol threshold of 35 mcgdL, 1 subject receiving fluticasone propionate (4) had an abnormal response at 1 year repeat testing at 18 months and 2 years was normal. Another subject receiving fluticasone propionate (5) had an abnormal response at 2 years. No subject on placebo had an abnormal response at 1 or 2 years. In a placebocontrolled clinical trial conducted in subjects aged 4 to 11 years, a 30minute cosyntropin stimulation test was performed in 41 subjects after 12 weeks of dosing with 50 or 100 mcg twice daily of fluticasone propionate via the DISKUS inhaler. One subject receiving fluticasone propionate via the DISKUS inhaler had a prestimulation plasma cortisol concentration 5 mcgdL, and 2 subjects had a rise in cortisol of 7 mcgdL. However, all poststimulation values were 18 mcgdL. The potential systemic effects of inhaled fluticasone propionate on the HPA axis were also studied in subjects with asthma. Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation aerosol at dosages of 220, 440, 660, or 880 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo or oral prednisone 10 mg given once daily for 4 weeks. For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by 6hour cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with inhaled fluticasone propionate treatment. No subject had an abnormal response (peak serum cortisol 18 mcgdL) after dosing with placebo or fluticasone propionate 220 mcg twice daily. For subjects treated with 440, 660, and 880 mcg twice daily, 10, 16, and 12, respectively, had an abnormal response as compared with 29 of subjects treated with prednisone.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Candida albicans infection of the mouth and pharynx may occur. Monitor patients periodically. Advise the patient to rinse hisher mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk. (5.1) Potential worsening of infections (e.g., existing tuberculosis fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection ocular herpes simplex). Use with caution in patients with these infections.More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients. (5.3) Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from systemic corticosteroids. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to FLOVENT DISKUS. (5.4) Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue FLOVENT DISKUS slowly. (5.5) Assess for decrease in bone mineral density initially and periodically thereafter. (5.7) Monitor growth of pediatric patients. (5.8) Close monitoring for glaucoma and cataracts is warranted. (5.9) 5.1 Local Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred in subjects treated with FLOVENT DISKUS. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with FLOVENT DISKUS continues, but at times therapy with FLOVENT DISKUS may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse hisher mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. 5.2 Acute Asthma Episodes FLOVENT DISKUS is not to be regarded as a bronchodilator and is not indicated for rapid relief of bronchospasm. Patients should be instructed to contact their physicians immediately when episodes of asthma that are not responsive to bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with FLOVENT DISKUS. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids. 5.3 Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease andor prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections or ocular herpes simplex. 5.4 Transferring Patients From Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although FLOVENT DISKUS may control asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to FLOVENT DISKUS. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with FLOVENT DISKUS. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1 or morning peak expiratory flow AM PEF), betaagonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, and hypotension. Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to FLOVENT DISKUS may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint andor muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression Fluticasone propionate will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of FLOVENT DISKUS in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing FLOVENT DISKUS. Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids in sensitive patients, patients treated with FLOVENT DISKUS should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, FLOVENT DISKUS should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and other treatments for management of asthma symptoms should be considered. 5.6 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of FLOVENT DISKUS. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of powder products containing lactose therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use FLOVENT DISKUS see Contraindications (4). 5.7 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with longterm administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to longterm consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. A 2year trial in 160 subjects (females aged 18 to 40 years, males 18 to 50) with asthma receiving CFCpropelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol 88 or 440 mcg twice daily demonstrated no statistically significant changes in BMD at any time point (24, 52, 76, and 104 weeks of doubleblind treatment) as assessed by dualenergy xray absorptiometry at lumbar regions L1 through L4. 5.8 Effect on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving FLOVENT DISKUS routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including FLOVENT DISKUS, titrate each patients dosage to the lowest dosage that effectively controls hisher symptoms see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4). 5.9 Glaucoma and Cataracts Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients following the longterm administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, andor cataracts. 5.10 Paradoxical Bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with FLOVENT DISKUS, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, shortacting bronchodilator FLOVENT DISKUS should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy should be instituted. 5.11 Drug Interactions With Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with FLOVENT DISKUS is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). 5.12 Eosinophilic Conditions and ChurgStrauss Syndrome In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with ChurgStrauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction andor withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other inhaled corticosteroids in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, andor neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>nursing_mothers</i>:</td><td>8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether fluticasone propionate is excreted in human breast milk. However, other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. Subcutaneous administration to lactating rats of tritiated fluticasone propionate at a dose approximately 0.04 times the MRHDID for adults on a mgm2 basis resulted in measurable radioactivity in milk. Since there are no data from controlled trials on the use of FLOVENT DISKUS by nursing mothers, caution should be exercised when FLOVENT DISKUS is administered to a nursing woman.</td></tr>

Methyldopa was not mutagenic in the Ames Test and did not increase chromosomal aberration or sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These in vitro studies were carried out both with and without exogenous metabolic activation. Fertility was unaffected when methyldopa was given to male and female rats at 100 mgkgday (1.7 times the maximum daily human dose when compared on the basis of body weight 0.2 times the maximum daily human dose when compared on the basis of body surface area). Methyldopa decreased sperm count, sperm motility, the number of late spermatids and the male fertility index when given to male rats at 200 and 400 mgkgday.

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed with methyldopa at oral doses up to 1000 mgkg in mice, 200 mgkg in rabbits and 100 mgkg in rats revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus. These doses are 16.6 times, 3.3 times and 1.7 times, respectively, the maximum daily human dose when compared on the basis of body weight 1.4 times, 1.1 times and 0.2 times, respectively, when compared on the basis of body surface area calculations assume a patient weight of 50 kg. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, methyldopa should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Published reports of the use of methyldopa during all trimesters indicate that if this drug is used during pregnancy the possibility of fetal harm appears remote. In five studies, three of which were controlled, involving 332 pregnant hypertensive women, treatment with methyldopa was associated with an improved fetal outcome. The majority of these women were in the third trimester when methyldopa therapy was begun. In one study, women who had begun methyldopa treatment between weeks 16 and 20 of pregnancy gave birth to infants whose average head circumference was reduced by a small amount (34.2  1.7 cm vs. 34.6  1.3 cm mean  1 S.D.). Longterm followup of 195 (97.5) of the children born to methyldopatreated pregnant women (including those who began treatment between weeks 16 and 20) failed to uncover any significant adverse effect on the children. At four years of age, the developmental delay commonly seen in children born to hypertensive mothers was less evident in those whose mothers were treated with methyldopa during pregnancy than those whose mothers were untreated. The children of the treated group scored consistently higher than the children of the untreated group on five major indices of intellectual and motor development. At age 7 and onehalf developmental scores and intelligence indices showed no significant differences in children of treated or untreated hypertensive women.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism The maximum decrease in blood pressure occurs four to six hours after oral dosage. Once an effective dosage level is attained, a smooth blood pressure response occurs in most patients in 12 to 24 hours. After withdrawal, blood pressure usually returns to pretreatment levels within 24 to 48 hours. Methyldopa is extensively metabolized. The known urinary metabolites are methyldopa mono0 sulfate 30methylmethyldopa 3,4dihydroxyphenylacetone methyldopamine 30methylmethyldopamine and their conjugates. Approximately 70 percent of the drug which is absorbed is excreted in the urine as methyldopa and its monoosulfate conjugate. The renal clearance is about 130 mLmin in normal subjects and is diminished in renal insufficiency. The plasma halflife of methyldopa is 105 minutes. After oral doses, excretion is essentially complete in 36 hours. Methyldopa crosses the placental barrier, appears in cord blood, and appears in breast milk.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS General Methyldopa should be used with caution in patients with a history of previous liver disease or dysfunction (see WARNINGS ). Some patients taking methyldopa experience clinical edema or weight gain which may be controlled by use of a diuretic. Methyldopa should not be continued if edema progresses or signs of heart failure appear. Hypertension has recurred occasionally after dialysis in patients given methyldopa because the drug is removed by this procedure. Rarely, involuntary choreoathetotic movements have been observed during therapy with methyldopa in patients with severe bilateral cerebrovascular disease. Should these movements occur, stop therapy. Laboratory Tests Blood count, Coombs test and liver function tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals (see WARNINGS ). Drug Interactions When methyldopa is used with other antihypertensive drugs, potentiation of antihypertensive effect may occur. Patients should be followed carefully to detect side reactions or unusual manifestations of drug idiosyncrasy. Patients may require reduced doses of anesthetics when on methyldopa. If hypotension does occur during anesthesia, it usually can be controlled by vasopressors. The adrenergic receptors remain sensitive during treatment with methyldopa. When methyldopa and lithium are given concomitantly, the patient should be carefully monitored for symptoms of lithium toxicity. Read the circular for lithium preparations. Several studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of methyldopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate. This may adversely affect blood pressure control in patients treated with methyldopa. Coadministration of methyldopa with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate is not recommended. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors See CONTRAINDICATIONS . DrugLaboratory Test Interactions Methyldopa may interfere with measurement of urinary uric acid by the phosphotungstate method, serum creatinine by the alkaline picrate method, and SGOT by colorimetric methods. Interference with spectrophotometric methods for SGOT analysis has not been reported. Since methyldopa causes fluorescence in urine samples at the same wave lengths as catecholamines, falsely high levels of urinary catecholamines may be reported. This will interfere with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. It is important to recognize this phenomenon before a patient with a possible pheochromocytoma is subjected to surgery. Methyldopa does not interfere with measurement of VMA (vanillylmandelic acid), a test for pheochromocytoma, by those methods which convert VMA to vanillin. Methyldopa is not recommended for the treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma. Rarely, when urine is exposed to air after voiding, it may darken because of breakdown of methyldopa or its metabolites. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was seen when methyldopa was given for two years to mice at doses up to 1800 mgkgday or to rats at doses up to 240 mgkgday.

Nursing Mothers Methyldopa appears in breast milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when methyldopa is given to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use There are no wellcontrolled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Information on dosing in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from published literature regarding the treatment of hypertension in pediatric patients. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (1685) in clinical studies of methyldopa, 223 patients were 65 years of age and over while 33 patients were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS It is important to recognize that a positive Coombs test, hemolytic anemia, and liver disorders may occur with methyldopa therapy. The rare occurrences of hemolytic anemia or liver disorders could lead to potentially fatal complications unless properly recognized and managed. Read this section carefully to understand these reactions. With prolonged methyldopa therapy, 10 to 20 percent of patients develop a positive direct Coombs test which usually occurs between 6 and 12 months of methyldopa therapy. Lowest incidence is at daily dosage of 1 g or less. This on rare occasions may be associated with hemolytic anemia, which could lead to potentially fatal complications. One cannot predict which patients with a positive direct Coombs test may develop hemolytic anemia. Prior existence or development of a positive direct Coombs test is not in itself a contraindication to use of methyldopa. If a positive Coombs test develops during methyldopa therapy, the physician should determine whether hemolytic anemia exists and whether the positive Coombs test may be a problem. For example, in addition to a positive direct Coombs test there is less often a positive indirect Coombs test which may interfere with cross matching of blood. Before treatment is started, it is desirable to do a blood count (hematocrit, hemoglobin, or red cell count) for a baseline or to establish whether there is anemia. Periodic blood counts should be done during therapy to detect hemolytic anemia. It may be useful to do a direct Coombs test before therapy and at 6 and 12 months after the start of therapy. If Coombspositive hemolytic anemia occurs, the cause may be methyldopa and the drug should be discontinued. Usually the anemia remits promptly. If not, corticosteroids may be given and other causes of anemia should be considered. If the hemolytic anemia is related to methyldopa, the drug should not be reinstituted. When methyldopa causes Coombs positivity alone or with hemolytic anemia, the red cell is usually coated with gamma globulin of the IgG (gamma G) class only. The positive Coombs test may not revert to normal until weeks to months after methyldopa is stopped. Should the need for transfusion arise in a patient receiving methyldopa, both a direct and an indirect Coombs test should be performed. In the absence of hemolytic anemia, usually only the direct Coombs test will be positive. A positive direct Coombs test alone will not interfere with typing or cross matching. If the indirect Coombs test is also positive, problems may arise in the major cross match and the assistance of a hematologist or transfusion expert will be needed. Occasionally, fever has occurred within the first three weeks of methyldopa therapy, associated in some cases with eosinophilia or abnormalities in one or more liver function tests, such as serum alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT), bilirubin, and prothrombin time. Jaundice, with or without fever, may occur with onset usually within the first two to three months of therapy. In some patients the findings are consistent with those of cholestasis. In others the findings are consistent with hepatitis and hepatocellular injury. Rarely, fatal hepatic necrosis has been reported after use of methyldopa. These hepatic changes may represent hypersensitivity reactions. Periodic determinations of hepatic function should be done particularly during the first 6 to 12 weeks of therapy or whenever an unexplained fever occurs. If fever, abnormalities in liver function tests, or jaundice appear, stop therapy with methyldopa. If caused by methyldopa, the temperature and abnormalities in liver function characteristically have reverted to normal when the drug was discontinued. Methyldopa should not be reinstituted in such patients. Rarely, a reversible reduction of the white blood cell count with a primary effect on the granulocytes has been seen. The granulocyte count returned promptly to normal on discontinuance of the drug. Rare cases of granulocytopenia have been reported. In each instance, upon stopping the drug, the white cell count returned to normal. Reversible thrombocytopenia has occurred rarely.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>DESCRIPTION Methyldopa is an antihypertensive and is the Lisomer of alphamethyldopa. It is levo3(3,4dihydroxyphenyl)2methylalanine sesquihydrate. Methyldopa is supplied as tablets for oral administration, containing 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg of methyldopa. The amount of methyldopa is calculated on the anhydrous basis. Its molecular formula is C 10H 13NO 4 1 12 H 2, with a molecular weight of 238.24, and its structural formula is Methyldopa is a white to yellowish white, odorless fine powder and is sparingly soluble in water. The tablets contain the following inactive ingredients pregelatinized starch, sodium starch glycolate, povidone, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, FDC yellow 6 lake and titanium dioxide. In addition 125 mg and 250 mg tablets contain corn starch. Methyldopa structural formula</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adults Initiation of Therapy The usual starting dosage of methyldopa tablet is 250 mg two to three times a day in the first 48 hours. The daily dosage then may be increased or decreased, preferably at intervals of not less than two days, until an adequate response is achieved. To minimize the sedation, start dosage increases in the evening. By adjustment of dosage, morning hypotension may be prevented without sacrificing control of afternoon blood pressure. When methyldopa is given to patients on other antihypertensives, the dose of these agents may need to be adjusted to effect a smooth transition. When methyldopa is given with antihypertensives other than thiazides, the initial dosage of methyldopa should be limited to 500 mg daily in divided doses when methyldopa is added to a thiazide, the dosage of thiazide need not be changed. Maintenance of Therapy The usual daily dosage of methyldopa is 500 mg to 2 g in two to four doses. Although occasional patients have responded to higher doses, the maximum recommended daily dosage is 3 g. Once an effective dosage range is attained, a smooth blood pressure response occurs in most patients in 12 to 24 hours. Since methyldopa has a relatively short duration of action, withdrawal is followed by return of hypertension usually within 48 hours. This is not complicated by an overshoot of blood pressure. Occasionally tolerance may occur, usually between the second and third month of therapy. Adding a diuretic or increasing the dosage of methyldopa frequently will restore effective control of blood pressure. A thiazide may be added at any time during methyldopa therapy and is recommended if therapy has not been started with a thiazide or if effective control of blood pressure cannot be maintained on 2 g of methyldopa daily. Methyldopa is largely excreted by the kidney and patients with impaired renal function may respond to smaller doses. Syncope in older patients may be related to an increased sensitivity and advanced arteriosclerotic vascular disease. This may be avoided by lower doses. Pediatric Patients Initial dosage is based on 10 mgkg of body weight daily in two to four doses. The daily dosage then is increased or decreased until an adequate response is achieved. The maximum dosage is 65 mgkg or 3 g daily, whichever is less (see PRECAUTIONS Pediatric Use .)</td></tr>

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Methyldopa is an aromaticaminoacid decarboxylase inhibitor in animals and in man. Although the mechanism of action has yet to be conclusively demonstrated, the antihypertensive effect of methyldopa probably is due to its metabolism to alphamethylnorepinephrine, which then lowers arterial pressure by stimulation of central inhibitory alphaadrenergic receptors, false neurotransmission, andor reduction of plasma renin activity. Methyldopa has been shown to cause a net reduction in the tissue concentration of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Only methyldopa, the Lisomer of alphamethyldopa, has the ability to inhibit dopa decarboxylase and to deplete animal tissues of norepinephrine. In man, the antihypertensive activity appears to be due solely to the Lisomer. About twice the dose of the racemate (DLalphamethyldopa) is required for equal antihypertensive effect. Methyldopa has no direct effect on cardiac function and usually does not reduce glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. Cardiac output usually is maintained without cardiac acceleration. In some patients the heart rate is slowed. Normal or elevated plasma renin activity may decrease in the course of methyldopa therapy. Methyldopa reduces both supine and standing blood pressure. It usually produces highly effective lowering of the supine pressure with infrequent symptomatic postural hypotension. Exercise hypotension and diurnal blood pressure variations rarely occur. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism The maximum decrease in blood pressure occurs four to six hours after oral dosage. Once an effective dosage level is attained, a smooth blood pressure response occurs in most patients in 12 to 24 hours. After withdrawal, blood pressure usually returns to pretreatment levels within 24 to 48 hours. Methyldopa is extensively metabolized. The known urinary metabolites are methyldopa mono0 sulfate 30methylmethyldopa 3,4dihydroxyphenylacetone methyldopamine 30methylmethyldopamine and their conjugates. Approximately 70 percent of the drug which is absorbed is excreted in the urine as methyldopa and its monoosulfate conjugate. The renal clearance is about 130 mLmin in normal subjects and is diminished in renal insufficiency. The plasma halflife of methyldopa is 105 minutes. After oral doses, excretion is essentially complete in 36 hours. Methyldopa crosses the placental barrier, appears in cord blood, and appears in breast milk.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_and_or_laboratory_test_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugLaboratory Test Interactions Methyldopa may interfere with measurement of urinary uric acid by the phosphotungstate method, serum creatinine by the alkaline picrate method, and SGOT by colorimetric methods. Interference with spectrophotometric methods for SGOT analysis has not been reported. Since methyldopa causes fluorescence in urine samples at the same wave lengths as catecholamines, falsely high levels of urinary catecholamines may be reported. This will interfere with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. It is important to recognize this phenomenon before a patient with a possible pheochromocytoma is subjected to surgery. Methyldopa does not interfere with measurement of VMA (vanillylmandelic acid), a test for pheochromocytoma, by those methods which convert VMA to vanillin. Methyldopa is not recommended for the treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma. Rarely, when urine is exposed to air after voiding, it may darken because of breakdown of methyldopa or its metabolites.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage may produce acute hypotension with other responses attributable to brain and gastrointestinal malfunction (excessive sedation, weakness, bradycardia, dizziness, lightheadedness, constipation, distention, flatus, diarrhea, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>). In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. When ingestion is recent, gastric lavage or emesis may reduce absorption. When ingestion has been earlier, infusions may be helpful to promote urinary excretion. Otherwise, management includes special attention to cardiac rate and output, blood volume, electrolyte balance, paralytic ileus, urinary function and cerebral activity. Sympathomimetic drugs e.g., levarterenol, epinephrine, ARAMINE 1 (Metaraminol Bitartrate) may be indicated. Methyldopa is dialyzable.

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed with methyldopa at oral doses up to 1000 mgkg in mice, 200 mgkg in rabbits and 100 mgkg in rats revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus. These doses are 16.6 times, 3.3 times and 1.7 times, respectively, the maximum daily human dose when compared on the basis of body weight 1.4 times, 1.1 times and 0.2 times, respectively, when compared on the basis of body surface area calculations assume a patient weight of 50 kg. There are, however, no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, methyldopa should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Published reports of the use of methyldopa during all trimesters indicate that if this drug is used during pregnancy the possibility of fetal harm appears remote. In five studies, three of which were controlled, involving 332 pregnant hypertensive women, treatment with methyldopa was associated with an improved fetal outcome. The majority of these women were in the third trimester when methyldopa therapy was begun. In one study, women who had begun methyldopa treatment between weeks 16 and 20 of pregnancy gave birth to infants whose average head circumference was reduced by a small amount (34.2  1.7 cm vs. 34.6  1.3 cm mean  1 S.D.). Longterm followup of 195 (97.5) of the children born to methyldopatreated pregnant women (including those who began treatment between weeks 16 and 20) failed to uncover any significant adverse effect on the children. At four years of age, the developmental delay commonly seen in children born to hypertensive mothers was less evident in those whose mothers were treated with methyldopa during pregnancy than those whose mothers were untreated. The children of the treated group scored consistently higher than the children of the untreated group on five major indices of intellectual and motor development. At age 7 and onehalf developmental scores and intelligence indices showed no significant differences in children of treated or untreated hypertensive women.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>boxed_warning</i>:</td><td>WARNING Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with DementiaRelated Psychosis Elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebocontrolled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drugtreated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebotreated patients. Over the course of a typical 10week controlled trial, the rate of death in drugtreated patients was about 4.5, compared to a rate of about 2.6 in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Haloperidol is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementiarelated psychosis (see WARNINGS)., Moderate Symptomatology  0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment. As with all antipsychotic drugs, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control. To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patients age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Children, debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels, as recommended below. Clinical experience suggests the following recommendations Oral Administration Inital Dosage Range Adults Moderate Symptomatology  0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Severe Symptomatology  3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. To achieve prompt control, higher doses may be required in some cases. Geriatric or Debilitated Patients  0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Chronic or Resistant Patients  3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Patients who remain severely disturbed or inadequately controlled may require dosage adjustment. Daily dosages up to 100 mg may be necessary in some cases to achieve an optimal response. Infrequently haloperidol has been used in doses above 100 mg for severely resistant patients however the limited clinical usage has not demonstrated the safety of prolonged administration of such doses. Children The following recommendations apply to children between the ages of 3 and 12 years (weight range 15 kg to 40 kg). Haloperidol is not intended for children under 3 years old. Therapy should begin at the lowest dose possible (0.5 mg per day). If required, the dose should be increased by an increment of 0.5 mg at 5 to 7 day intervals until the desired therapeutic effect is obtained. (See chart below.) The total dose may be divided, to be given b.i.d. or t.i.d. Psychotic Disorders  0.05 mgkgday to 0.15 mgkgday Nonpsychotic Behavior Disorders and Tourettes Disorder  0.05 mgkgday to 0.075 mgkgday Severely disturbed psychotic children may require higher doses. In severely disturbed, nonpsychotic children or in hyperactive children with accompanying conduct disorders, who have failed to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics, it should be noted that since these behaviors may be short lived, short term administration of haloperidol may suffice. There is no evidence establishing a maximum effective dosage. There is little evidence that behavior improvement is further enhanced in dosages beyond 6 mg per day. Maintenance Dosage Upon achieving a satisfactory therapeutic response, dosage should then be gradually reduced to the lowest effective maintenance level. Switchover Procedure The oral form should supplant the injectable as soon as practicable. In the absence of bioavailability studies establishing bioequivalence between these two dosage forms the following guidelines for dosage are suggested. For an initial approximation of the total daily dose required, the parenteral dose administered in the preceding 24 hours may be used. Since this dose is only an initial estimate, it is recommended that careful monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, including clinical efficacy, sedation, and adverse effects, be carried out periodically for the first several days following the initiation of switchover. In this way, dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, can be quickly accomplished. Depending on the patients clinical status, the first oral dose should be given within 12 to 24 hours following the last parenteral dose."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Manifestations In general, the symptoms of overdosage would be an exaggeration of known pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most prominent of which would be 1) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 2) hypotension, or 3) sedation. The patient would appear comatose with respiratory depression and hypotension which could be severe enough to produce a shocklike state. The extrapyramidal reaction would be manifest by muscular weakness or rigidity and a generalized or localized tremor as demonstrated by the akinetic or agitans types respectively. With accidental overdosage, hypertension rather than hypotension occurred in a 2 year old child. The risk of ECG changes associated with Torsades de pointes should be considered. (For further information regarding Torsades de pointes, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS.) Treatment Gastric lavage or induction of emesis should be carried out immediately followed by administration of activated charcoal. Since there is no specific antidote, treatment is primarily supportive. A patent airway must be established by use of an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube or, in prolonged cases of coma, by tracheostomy. Respiratory depression may be counteracted by artificial respiration and mechanical respirators. Hypotension and circulatory collapse may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine should not be used. In case of seere extrapyramidal reactions, antiarkinson medication should be administered. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for signs of QT prolongation or dysrhythmias and monitoring should continue until the ECG is normal. Severe arrhythmias should be treated with appropriate antiarrhythmic measures.</td></tr>

Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QTprolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QTsyndrome). Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the longterm course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome. (For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS.) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Hyperpyrexia and heat stroke, not associated with the above symptom complex, have also been reported with haloperidol. Usage in Pregnancy Rodents given 2 to 20 times the usual maximum human dose of haloperidol by oral or parenteral routes showed an increase in incidence of resorption, reduced fertility, delayed delivery and pup mortality. No teratogenic effect has been reported in rats, rabbits or dogs at dosages within this range, but cleft palate has been observed in mice given 15 times the usual maximum human dose. Cleft palate in mice appears to be a nonspecific response to stress or nutritional imbalance as well as to a variety of drugs, and there is no evidence to relate this phenomenon to predictable human risk for most of these agents. There are no well controlled studies with haloperidol in pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of limb malformations observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy. Causal relationships were not established in these cases. Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women likely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus. Infants should not be nursed during drug treatment. Combined Use of Haloperidol and Lithium An encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated serum enzymes, BUN, and FBS) followed by irreversible brain damage has occurred in a few patients treated with lithium plus haloperidol. A causal relationship between these events and the concomitant administration of lithium and haloperidol has not been established however, patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely for early evidence of neurological toxicity and treatment discontinued promptly if such signs appear. General A number of cases of bronchopneumonia, some fatal, have followed the use of antipsychotic drugs, including haloperidol. It has been postulated that lethargy and decreased sensation of thirst due to central inhibition may lead to dehydration, hemoconcentration and reduced pulmonary ventilation. Therefore, if the above signs and symptoms appear, especially in the elderly, the physician should institute remedial therapy promptly. Although not reported with haloperidol, decreased serum cholesterol andor cutaneous and ocular changes have been reported in patients receiving chemicallyrelated drugs. Haloperidol may impair the mental andor physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. The ambulatory patient should be warned accordingly. The use of alcohol with this drug should be avoided due to possible additive effects and hypotension.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS Cardiovascular Effects Tachycardia, hypotension, and hypertension have been reported. QT prolongation andor ventricular arrhythmias have also been reported, in addition to ECG pattern changes compatible with the polymorphous configuration of Torsades de pointes, and may occur more frequently with high doses and in predisposed patients (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Cases of sudden and unexpected death have been reported in association with the administration of haloperidol. The nature of the evidence makes it impossible to determine definitively what role, if any, haloperidol played in the outcome of the reported cases. The possibility that haloperidol caused death cannot, of course, be excluded, but it is to be kept in mind that sudden and unexpected death may occur in psychotic patients when they go untreated or when they are treated with other antipsychotic drugs. CNS Effects Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) EPS during the administration of haloperidol have been reported frequently, often during the first few days of treatment. EPS can be categorized generally as Parkinsonlike symptoms, akathisia, or dystonia (including opisthotonos and oculogyric crisis). While all can occur at relatively low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher doses. The symptoms may be controlled with dose reductions or administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate, USP or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride, USP. It should be noted that persistent EPS have been reported the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases. Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, andor protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs Generally, patients receiving shortterm therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under Tardive Dyskinesia except for duration. It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol. Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents, haloperidol has been associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may appear in some patients on longterm therapy or may occur after drug therapy has been discontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on high dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk. There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked. It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and if the medication is stopped at that time, the full syndrome may not develop. Tardive Dystonia Tardive dystonia, not associated with the above syndrome, has also been reported. Tardive dystonia is characterized by delayed onset of choreic or dystonic movements, is often persistent, and has the potential of becoming irreversible. Other CNS Effects Insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, euphoria, agitation, drowsiness, depression, lethargy, headache, confusion, vertigo, grand mal seizures, exacerbation of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations and catatoniclike behavioral states which may be responsive to drug withdrawal andor treatment with anticholinergic drugs. Body as a Whole Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), hyperpyrexia and heat stroke have been reported with haloperidol. (See WARNINGS for further information concerning NMS.) Hematologic Effects Reports have appeared citing the occurrence of mild and usually transient leukopenia and leukocytosis, minimal decreases in red blood cell counts, anemia, or a tendency toward lymphomonocytosis. Agranulocytosis has rarely been reported to have occurred with the use of haloperidol, and then only in association with other medication. Liver Effects Impaired liver function andor jaundice have been reported. Dermatologic Reactions Maculopapular and acneiform skin reactions and isolated cases of photosensitivity and loss of hair. Endocrine Disorders Lactation, breast engorgement, mastalgia, menstrual irregularities, gynecomastia, impotence, increased libido, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and hyponatremia. Gastrointestinal Effects Anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, hypersalivation, dyspepsia, nausea and <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>. Autonomic Reactions Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, diaphoresis and priapism. Respiratory Effects Laryngospasm, bronchospasm and increased depth of respiration. Special Senses Cataracts, retinopathy and visual disturbances. Postmarketing Events Hyperammonemia has been reported in a 512 year old child with citrullinemia, an inherited disorder of ammonia excretion, following treatment with haloperidol.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS Haloperidol should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular disorders, because of the possibility of transient hypotension andor precipitation of anginal pain. Should hypotension occur and a vasopressor be required, epinephrine should not be used since haloperidol may block its vasopressor activity and paradoxical further lowering of the blood pressure may occur. Instead, metaraminol, phenylephrine or norepinephrine should be used. receiving anticonvulsant medications, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because haloperidol may lower the convulsive threshold. If indicated, adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be concomitantly maintained. with known allergies, or with a history of allergic reactions to drugs. receiving anticoagulants, since an isolated instance of interference occurred with the effects of one anticoagulant (phenindione). If concomitant antiparkinson medication is required, it may have to be continued after haloperidol is discontinued because of the difference in excretion rates. If both are discontinued simultaneously, extrapyramidal symptoms may occur. The physician should keep in mind the possible increase in intraocular pressure when anticholinergic drugs, including antiparkinson agents, are administered concomitantly with haloperidol. As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that haloperidol may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol. In a study of 12 schizophrenic patients coadministered haloperidol and rifampin, plasma haloperidol levels were decreased by a mean of 70 and mean scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were increased from baseline. In 5 other schizophrenic patients treated with haloperidol and rifampin, discontinuation of rifampin produced a mean 3.3fold increase in haloperidol concentrations. Thus, careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted when rifampin is administered or discontinued in haloperidoltreated patients. When haloperidol is used to control mania in cyclic disorders, there may be a rapid mood swing to depression. Severe neurotoxicity (rigidity, inability to walk or talk) may occur in patients with thyrotoxicosis who are also receiving antipsychotic medication, including haloperidol. No mutagenic potential of haloperidol was found in the Ames Salmonella microsomal activation assay. Negative or inconsistent positive findings have been obtained in in vitro and in vivo studies of effects of haloperidol on chromosome structure and number. The available cytogenetic evidence is considered too inconsistent to be conclusive at this time. Carcinogenicity studies using oral haloperidol were conducted in Wistar rats (dosed at up to 5 mgkg daily for 24 months) and in Albino Swiss mice (dosed at up to 5 mgkg daily for 18 months). In the rat study, survival was less than optimal in all dose groups, reducing the number of rats at risk for developing tumors. However, although a relatively greater number of rats survived to the end of the study in high dose male and female groups, these animals did not have a greater incidence of tumors than control animals. Therefore, although not optimal, this study does suggest the absence of a haloperidol related increase in the incidence of neoplasia in rats at doses up to 20 times the usual daily human dose for chronic or resistant patients. In female mice at 5 and 20 times the highest initial daily dose for chronic or resistant patients, there was a statistically significant increase in mammary gland neoplasia and total tumor incidence at 20 times the same daily dose there was a statistically significant increase in pituitary gland neoplasia. In male mice, no statistically significant differences in incidences of total tumors or specific tumor types were noted. Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately onethird of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. There are no well controlled studies with haloperidol in pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of limb malformations observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy. Causal relationships were not established in these cases. Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women likely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus. Infants should not be nursed during drug treatment. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of haloperidol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not consistently identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women (see WARNINGS Tardive Dyskinesia). Also, the pharmacokinetics of haloperidol in geriatric patients generally warrants the use of lower doses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Valproate was administered orally to rats and mice at doses of 80 and 170 mgkgday (less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis) for two years. The primary findings were an increase in the incidence of subcutaneous fibrosarcomas in highdose male rats receiving valproate and a doserelated trend for benign pulmonary adenomas in male mice receiving valproate. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Valproate was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial assay (Ames test), did not produce dominant lethal effects in mice, and did not increase chromosome aberration frequency in an in vivo cytogenetic study in rats. Increased frequencies of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) have been reported in a study of epileptic children taking valproate, but this association was not observed in another study conducted in adults. There is some evidence that increased SCE frequencies may be associated with epilepsy. The biological significance of an increase in SCE frequency is not known. Fertility Chronic toxicity studies of valproate in juvenile and adult rats and dogs demonstrated reduced spermatogenesis and testicular atrophy at oral doses of 400 mgkgday or greater in rats (approximately equivalent to or greater than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mgm2 basis) and 150 mgkgday or greater in dogs (approximately 1.4 times the MRHD or greater on a mgm2 basis). Fertility studies in rats have shown no effect on fertility at oral doses of valproate up to 350 mgkgday (approximately equal to the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) for 60 days. The effect of valproate on testicular development and on sperm production and fertility in humans is unknown.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics AbsorptionBioavailability Equivalent oral doses of divalproex sodium products and valproic acid capsules deliver equivalent quantities of valproate ion systemically. Although the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation administered (liquid, solid, or sprinkle), conditions of use (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the method of administration (e.g., whether the contents of the capsule are sprinkled on food or the capsule is taken intact), these differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy. However, it is possible that differences among the various valproate products in Tmax and Cmax could be important upon initiation of treatment. For example, in single dose studies, the effect of feeding had a greater influence on the rate of absorption of the divalproex sodium tablet (increase in Tmax from 4 to 8 hours) than on the absorption of the divalproex sodium sprinkle capsules (increase in Tmax from 3.3 to 4.8 hours). While the absorption rate from the G.I. tract and fluctuation in valproate plasma concentrations vary with dosing regimen and formulation, the efficacy of valproate as an anticonvulsant in chronic use is unlikely to be affected. Experience employing dosing regimens from onceaday to fourtimesaday, as well as studies in primate epilepsy models involving constant rate infusion, indicate that total daily systemic bioavailability (extent of absorption) is the primary determinant of seizure control and that differences in the ratios of plasma peak to trough concentrations between valproate formulations are inconsequential from a practical clinical standpoint. Coadministration of oral valproate products with food and substitution among the various divalproex sodium and valproic acid formulations should cause no clinical problems in the management of patients with epilepsy see Dosage and Administration (2.1). Nonetheless, any changes in dosage administration, or the addition or discontinuance of concomitant drugs should ordinarily be accompanied by close monitoring of clinical status and valproate plasma concentrations. Distribution Protein Binding The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10 at 40 mcgmL to 18.5 at 130 mcgmL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain proteinbound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide). (See Drug Interactions (7.2) for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs.) CNS Distribution Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10 of total concentration). Metabolism Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 3050 of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40 of the dose. Usually, less than 1520 of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3 of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine. The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding. The kinetics of unbound drug are linear. Elimination Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 Lhr1.73 m2 and 11 L1.73 m2, respectively. Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free valproate are 4.6 Lhr1.73 m2 and 92 L1.73 m2. Mean terminal halflife for valproate monotherapy ranged from 9 to 16 hours following oral dosing regimens of 250 to 1000 mg. The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzymeinducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn. Special Populations Effect of Age Neonates Children within the first two months of life have a markedly decreased ability to eliminate valproate compared to older children and adults. This is a result of reduced clearance (perhaps due to delay in development of glucuronosyltransferase and other enzyme systems involved in valproate elimination) as well as increased volume of distribution (in part due to decreased plasma protein binding). For example, in one study, the halflife in children under 10 days ranged from 10 to 67 hours compared to a range of 7 to 13 hours in children greater than 2 months. Children Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50 higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mLminkg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults. Elderly The capacity of elderly patients (age range 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to be reduced compared to younger adults (age range 22 to 26). Intrinsic clearance is reduced by 39 the free fraction is increased by 44. Accordingly, the initial dosage should be reduced in the elderly see Dosage and Administration (2.2). Effect of Sex There are no differences in the body surface area adjusted unbound clearance between males and females (4.8  0.17 and 4.7  0.07 Lhr per 1.73 m2, respectively). Effect of Race The effects of race on the kinetics of valproate have not been studied. Effect of Disease Liver Disease See Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Liver disease impairs the capacity to eliminate valproate. In one study, the clearance of free valproate was decreased by 50 in 7 patients with cirrhosis and by 16 in 4 patients with acute hepatitis, compared with 6 healthy subjects. In that study, the halflife of valproate was increased from 12 to 18 hours. Liver disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and larger unbound fractions (2 to 2.6 fold increase) of valproate. Accordingly, monitoring of total concentrations may be misleading since free concentrations may be substantially elevated in patients with hepatic disease whereas total concentrations may appear to be normal. Renal Disease A slight reduction (27) in the unbound clearance of valproate has been reported in patients with renal failure (creatinine clearance  10 mLminute) however, hemodialysis typically reduces valproate concentrations by about 20. Therefore, no dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in patients with renal failure. Protein binding in these patients is substantially reduced thus, monitoring total concentrations may be misleading.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>"8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D for epilepsy see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3). Pregnancy Registry To collect information on the effects of in utero exposure to valproic acid, physicians should encourage pregnant patients taking valproic acid capsules to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling toll free 18882332334, and must be done by the patients themselves. Information on the registry can be found at the website, httpwww.aedpregnancyregistry.org. Fetal Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects (about 3), pregnancy loss (about 15), or other adverse outcomes regardless of drug exposure. Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations). The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who used other antiseizure monotherapies see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Exposure in utero to valproate products has been associated with cerebral atrophy see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Adverse Reactions (6.4). Several published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits. Clinical Considerations Neural tube defects are the congenital malformation most strongly associated with maternal valproate use. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure is generally estimated as 12, compared to an estimated general population risk for spina bifida of about 0.06 to 0.07 (6 to 7 in 10,000 births). Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores in children whose mothers were treated with valproate during pregnancy. Because of the risks of decreased IQ, neural tube defects, and other fetal adverse events, which may occur very early in pregnancy Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine). Valproic acid capsules should not be used to treat women with epilepsy who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks. When treating a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing potential, carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment and provide appropriate counseling. To prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Even minor seizures may pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. However, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy in individual cases if the seizure disorder severity and frequency do not pose a serious threat to the patient. Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered to pregnant women using valproate. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate. Patients taking valproate may develop clotting abnormalities see Warnings and Precautions (5.9). A patient who had low fibrinogen when taking multiple anticonvulsants including valproate gave birth to an infant with afibrinogenemia who subsequently died of hemorrhage. If valproate is used in pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully. Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have also been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Data Human There is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the CDCs National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is about 0.06 to 0.07. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure has been estimated to be approximately 1 to 2. In one study using NAAED Pregnancy Registry data, 16 cases of major malformations following prenatal valproate exposure were reported among offspring of 149 enrolled women who used valproate during pregnancy. Three of the 16 cases were neural tube defects the remaining cases included craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations of varying severity involving other body systems. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported a major malformation rate of 10.7 (95 C.I. 6.3  16.9) in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000 mgday of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy (dose range 5002000 mgday). The major malformation rate among the internal comparison group of 1,048 epileptic women who received any other antiepileptic drug monotherapy during pregnancy was 2.9 (95 CI 2.0 to 4.1). These data show a fourfold increased risk for any major malformation (Odds Ratio 4.0 95 CI 2.1 to 7.4) following valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to any other antiepileptic drug monotherapy. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 95 C.I. 94101) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated lamotrigine (108 95 C.I. 105110), carbamazepine (105 95 C.I. 102108) and phenytoin (108 95 C.I. 104112). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproateexposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed. Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports a causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects on cognitive development. There are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy. Animal In developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of fetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryofetal death occurred following treatment of pregnant animals with valproate during organogenesis at clinically relevant doses (calculated on a body surface area basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ systems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other malformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during critical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug levels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and brain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally to clinically relevant doses of valproate."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Hepatic enzymeinducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance. Therefore increased monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations and dosage adjustment are indicated whenever enzymeinducing or inhibiting drugs are introduced or withdrawn (7.1) Aspirin, carbapenem antibiotics Monitoring of valproate concentrations is recommended (7.1) Coadministration of valproate can affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs (e.g. diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, phenytoin) by inhibiting their metabolism or protein binding displacement (7.2) Dosage adjustment of amitryptylinenortryptyline, warfarin, and zidovudine may be necessary if used concomitantly with valproic acid capsules (7.2) Topiramate Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy (5.11, 7.3) 7.1 Effects of CoAdministered Drugs on Valproate Clearance Drugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases, may increase the clearance of valproate. For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer halflives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs. In contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and betaoxidation. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn. The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported. Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed Aspirin A study involving the coadministration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mgkg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n  6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate. Valproate free fraction was increased 4fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone. The oxidation pathway consisting of 2Evalproic acid, 3OHvalproic acid, and 3keto valproic acid was decreased from 25 of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3 in the presence of aspirin. Caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be coadministered. Carbapenem Antibiotics A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates see Warnings and Precautions (5.14). Felbamate A study involving the coadministration of 1200 mgday of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n  10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35 (from 86 to 115 mcgmL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2400 mgday increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcgmL (another 16 increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated. Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mgkg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40 increase in the oral clearance of valproate. Valproate dosage adjustment may be necessary when it is coadministered with rifampin. Drugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed Antacids A study involving the coadministration of valproate 500 mg with commonly administered antacids (Maalox, Trisogel, and Titralac  160 mEq doses) did not reveal any effect on the extent of absorption of valproate. Chlorpromazine A study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mgday of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15 increase in trough plasma levels of valproate. Haloperidol A study involving the administration of 6 to 10 mgday of haloperidol to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed no significant changes in valproate trough plasma levels. Cimetidine and Ranitidine Cimetidine and ranitidine do not affect the clearance of valproate. 7.2 Effects of Valproate on Other Drugs Valproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and glucuronyltransferases. The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of valproate coadministration on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of several commonly prescribed medications. The list is not exhaustive, since new interactions are continuously being reported. Drugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed AmitriptylineNortriptyline Administration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21 decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34 decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline. Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity. Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly with amitriptyline. Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptylinenortriptyline in the presence of valproate. Carbamazepinecarbamazepine10,11Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17 while that of carbamazepine10,11epoxide (CBZE) increased by 45 upon coadministration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients. Clonazepam The concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a history of absence type seizures. Diazepam Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism. Coadministration of valproate (1500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90 in healthy volunteers (n  6). Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25 and 20, respectively, in the presence of valproate. The elimination halflife of diazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate. Ethosuximide Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide. Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1600 mgday) to healthy volunteers (n6) was accompanied by a 25 increase in elimination halflife of ethosuximide and a 15 decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along with other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs. Lamotrigine In a steadystate study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination halflife of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate coadministration (a 165 increase). The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when coadministered with valproate. Serious skin reactions (such as StevensJohnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported with concomitant lamotrigine and valproate administration. See lamotrigine package insert for details on lamotrigine dosing with concomitant valproate administration. Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital. Coadministration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n  6) resulted in a 50 increase in halflife and a 30 decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg singledose). The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50 in presence of valproate. There is evidence for severe CNS depression, with or without significant elevations of barbiturate or valproate serum concentrations. All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored for neurological toxicity. Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate. Primidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with valproate. Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n  7) was associated with a 60 increase in the free fraction of phenytoin. Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30 in the presence of valproate. Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25. In patients with epilepsy, there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with the combination of valproate and phenytoin. The dosage of phenytoin should be adjusted as required by the clinical situation. Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20 to 50 when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate. The clinical relevance of this displacement is unknown. Warfarin In an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6. The therapeutic relevance of this is unknown however, coagulation tests should be monitored if valproate therapy is instituted in patients taking anticoagulants. Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38 after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h) the halflife of zidovudine was unaffected. Drugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed Acetaminophen Valproate had no effect on any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of acetaminophen when it was concurrently administered to three epileptic patients. Clozapine In psychotic patients (n  11), no interaction was observed when valproate was coadministered with clozapine. Lithium Coadministration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lithium carbonate (300 mg TID) to normal male volunteers (n  16) had no effect on the steadystate kinetics of lithium. Lorazepam Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n  9) was accompanied by a 17 decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam. Oral Contraceptive Steroids Administration of a singledose of ethinyloestradiol (50 mcg)levonorgestrel (250 mcg) to 6 women on valproate (200 mg BID) therapy for 2 months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction. 7.3 Topiramate Concomitant administration of valproate and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10, 5.11). Concomitant administration of topiramate with valproate has also been associated with hypothermia in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. It may be prudent to examine blood ammonia levels in patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported see Warnings and Precautions (5.10, 5.12).</td></tr>

Based on a placebocontrolled trial of adjunctive therapy for treatment of complex partial seizures, divalproex sodium tablets were generally well tolerated with most adverse reactions rated as mild to moderate in severity. Intolerance was the primary reason for discontinuation in the divalproex sodium tabletstreated patients (6), compared to 1 of placebotreated patients. Table 3 lists treatmentemergent adverse reactions which were reported by  5 of divalproex sodiumtreated patients and for which the incidence was greater than in the placebo group, in a placebocontrolled trial of adjunctive therapy for the treatment of complex partial seizures. Since patients were also treated with other antiepilepsy drugs, it is not possible, in most cases, to determine whether the following adverse reactions can be ascribed to divalproex sodium tablets alone, or the combination of divalproex sodium tablets and other antiepilepsy drugs.

Gastrointestinal The most commonly reported side effects at the initiation of therapy are nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, and indigestion. These effects are usually transient and rarely require discontinuation of therapy. Diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and constipation have been reported. Both anorexia with some weight loss and increased appetite with weight gain have also been reported. The administration of delayedrelease divalproex sodium may result in reduction of gastrointestinal side effects in some patients. CNS Effects Sedative effects have occurred in patients receiving valproate alone but occur most often in patients receiving combination therapy. Sedation usually abates upon reduction of other antiepileptic medication. Tremor (may be doserelated), hallucinations, ataxia, headache, nystagmus, diplopia, asterixis, "spots before eyes", dysarthria, dizziness, confusion, hypesthesia, vertigo, incoordination, and Parkinsonism have been reported with the use of valproate. Rare cases of coma have occurred in patients receiving valproate alone or in conjunction with phenobarbital. In rare instances encephalopathy with or without fever has developed shortly after the introduction of valproate monotherapy without evidence of hepatic dysfunction or inappropriately high plasma valproate levels. Although recovery has been described following drug withdrawal, there have been fatalities in patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy, particularly in patients with underlying urea cycle disorders see Warnings and Precautions (5.6). There have been postmarketing reports of reversible and irreversible cerebral and cerebellar atrophy temporally associated with the use of valproate products. In some cases the patients recovered with permanent sequelae see Warnings and Precautions (5.7). Cerebral atrophy has been reported in children exposed to valproate in utero see Use in Specific Populations (8.1). Dermatologic Transient hair loss, skin rash, photosensitivity, generalized pruritus, erythema multiforme, and StevensJohnson syndrome. Rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported including a fatal case in a 6 month old infant taking valproate and several other concomitant medications. An additional case of toxic epidermal necrosis resulting in death was reported in a 35 year old patient with AIDS taking several concomitant medications and with a history of multiple cutaneous drug reactions. Serious skin reactions have been reported with concomitant administration of lamotrigine and valproate see Drug Interactions (7). Psychiatric Emotional upset, depression, psychosis, aggression, hyperactivity, hostility, and behavioral deterioration. Musculoskeletal Weakness. Hematologic Thrombocytopenia and inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation may be reflected in altered bleeding time, petechiae, bruising, hematoma formation, epistaxis, and frank hemorrhage see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Drug Interactions (7). Relative lymphocytosis, macrocytosis, hypofibrinogenemia, leucopenia, eosinophilia, anemia including macrocytic with or without folate deficiency, bone marrow suppression, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and acute intermittent porphyria. Hepatic Minor elevations of transaminases (e.g., SGOT and SGPT) and LDH are frequent and appear to be doserelated. Occasionally, laboratory test results include increases in serum bilirubin and abnormal changes in other liver function tests. These results may reflect potentially serious hepatotoxicity see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Endocrine Irregular menses, secondary amenorrhea, breast enlargement, galactorrhea, and parotid gland swelling. Abnormal thyroid function tests see Warnings and Precautions (5.17). There have been rare spontaneous reports of polycystic ovary disease. A cause and effect relationship has not been established. Pancreatic Acute pancreatitis, including fatalities see Warnings and Precautions (5.5). Metabolic Hyperammonemia see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), hyponatremia, and inappropriate ADH secretion. There have been rare reports of Fanconis syndrome occurring chiefly in children. Decreased carnitine concentrations have been reported although the clinical relevance is undetermined. Hyperglycinemia has occurred and was associated with a fatal outcome in a patient with preexistent nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Genitourinary Enuresis and urinary tract infection. Special Senses Hearing loss, either reversible or irreversible, has been reported however, a cause and effect relationship has not been established. Ear pain has also been reported. Other Allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, edema of the extremities, lupus erythematosus, bone pain, cough increased, pneumonia, otitis media, bradycardia, cutaneous vasculitis, fever, and hypothermia. There have been reports of developmental delay, autism andor autism spectrum disorder in the offspring of women exposed to valproate during pregnancy.</td></tr>

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. What is the most important information I should know about valproic acid capsules? Do not stop taking valproic acid capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping valproic acid capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Valproic acid capsules can cause serious side effects, including 1. Serious liver damage that can cause death, especially in children younger than 2 years old. The risk of getting this serious liver damage is more likely to happen within the first 6 months of treatment. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms nausea or <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b> that does not go away loss of appetite pain on the right side of your stomach (abdomen) dark urine swelling of your face yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes In some cases, liver damage may continue despite stopping the drug. 2. Valproic acid capsules may harm your unborn baby. If you take valproic acid capsules during pregnancy for any medical condition, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. The most common birth defects with valproic acid capsules affect the brain and spinal cord and are called spina bifida or neural tube defects. These defects occur in 1 to 2 out of every 100 babies born to mothers who use this medicine during pregnancy. These defects can begin in the first month, even before you know you are pregnant. Other birth defects can happen. Birth defects may occur even in children born to women who are not taking any medicines and do not have other risk factors. Taking folic acid supplements before getting pregnant and during early pregnancy can lower the chance of having a baby with a neural tube defect. If you take valproic acid capsules during pregnancy for any medical condition, your child is at risk for having a lower IQ. There may be other medicines to treat your condition that have a lower chance of causing birth defects and decreased IQ in your child. Women who are pregnant must not take valproic acid capsules to prevent migraine headaches. All women of childbearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of valproic acid capsules. If the decision is made to use valproic acid capsules, you should use effective birth control (contraception). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant while taking valproic acid capsules. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will continue to take valproic acid capsules while you are pregnant. Pregnancy Registry If you become pregnant while taking valproic acid capsules, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can enroll in this registry by calling 18882332334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. 3. Inflammation of your pancreas that can cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms severe stomach pain that you may also feel in your back nausea or <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b> that does not go away 4. Like other antiepileptic drugs, valproic acid capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) new or worse irritability acting aggressive, being angry, or violent acting on dangerous impulses an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) other unusual changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all followup visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Do not stop valproic acid capsules without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping valproic acid capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly in a patient who has epilepsy can cause seizures that do not stop (status epilepticus). Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. What are valproic acid capsules? Valproic acid capsules are prescription medicines used alone or with other medicines, to treat complex partial seizures in adults and children 10 years of age and older simple and complex absence seizures, with or without other seizure types Who should not take valproic acid capsules?

<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.4 Pediatric Use Experience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions see Boxed Warning. When valproic acid capsules are used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of 2 years, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups. Younger children, especially those receiving enzymeinducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to attain targeted total and unbound valproic acid concentrations. Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50 higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mLminkg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults. The variability in free fraction limits the clinical usefulness of monitoring total serum valproic acid concentrations. Interpretation of valproic acid concentrations in children should include consideration of factors that affect hepatic metabolism and protein binding. Pediatric Clinical Trials Divalproex sodium tablets were studied in seven pediatric clinical trials. Two of the pediatric studies were doubleblinded placebocontrolled trials to evaluate the efficacy of divalproex sodium tablets ER for the indications of mania (150 patients aged 10 to 17 years, 76 of whom were on divalproex sodium tablets ER) and migraine (304 patients aged 12 to 17 years, 231 of whom were on divalproex sodium tablets ER). Efficacy was not established for either the treatment of migraine or the treatment of mania. The most common drugrelated adverse reactions (reported 5 and twice the rate of placebo) reported in the controlled pediatric mania study were nausea, upper abdominal pain, somnolence, increased ammonia, gastritis and rash. The remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two sixmonth pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the longterm safety of divalproex sodium tablets ER for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years). Two twelvemonth pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the longterm safety of divalproex sodium tablets ER for the indication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelvemonth study was conducted to evaluate the safety of divalproex sodium sprinkle capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years). In these seven trials, the safety and tolerability of divalproex sodium tablets in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults see Adverse Reactions (6). Juvenile Animal Toxicology In studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included retinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in rats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The noeffect dose for these findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis.</td></tr>

Advise women to use effective contraception while using valproate. When appropriate, counsel these patients about alternative therapeutic options. This is particularly important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death. Advise patients to read the Medication Guide, which appears as the last section of the labeling see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1). Advise women of childbearing potential to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor and to contact their doctor immediately if they think they are pregnant. Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 18882332334 see Use in Specific Populations (8.1). 17.4 Suicidal Thinking and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including valproic acid capsules, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about selfharm. Instruct patients, caregivers, and families to report behaviors of concern immediately to the healthcare providers see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) . 17.5 Hyperammonemia Inform patients of the signs and symptoms associated with hyperammonemic encephalopathy and be told to inform the prescriber if any of these symptoms occur see Warnings and Precautions (5.10, 5.11). 17.6 CNS Depression Since valproate products may produce CNS depression, especially when combined with another CNS depressant (e.g., alcohol), advise patients not to engage in hazardous activities, such as driving an automobile or operating dangerous machinery, until it is known that they do not become drowsy from the drug. 17.7 MultiOrgan Hypersensitivity Reactions Instruct patients that a fever associated with other organ system involvement (rash, lymphadenopathy, etc.) may be drugrelated and should be reported to the physician immediately see Warnings and Precautions (5.13).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Valproic acid capsules are intended for oral administration. (2.1) Simple and Complex Absence Seizures Start at 10 to 15 mgkgday, increasing at 1 week intervals by 5 to 10 mgkgweek until seizure control or limiting side effects (2.1) Safety of doses above 60 mgkgday is not established (2.1, 2.2) 2.1 Epilepsy Valproic acid capsules are intended for oral administration. Valproic acid capsules should be swallowed whole without chewing to avoid local irritation of the mouth and throat. Patients should be informed to take valproic acid capsules every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. If a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose. Valproic acid capsules are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. As the valproic acid capsules dosage is titrated upward, concentrations of clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, tolbutamide, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, andor phenytoin may be affected see Drug Interactions (7.2). Complex Partial Seizures For adults and children 10 years of age or older. Monotherapy (Initial Therapy) Valproic acid capsules have not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mgkgday. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mgkgweek to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mgkgday. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcgmL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mgkgday can be made. The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcgmL in females and 135 mcgmL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions. Conversion to Monotherapy Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mgkgday. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mgkgweek to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mgkgday. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50100 mcgmL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mgkgday can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25 every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of valproic acid capsules therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency. Adjunctive Therapy Valproic acid capsules may be added to the patients regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mgkgday. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mgkgweek to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mgkgday. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcgmL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mgkgday can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses. In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to divalproex sodium tablets, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed see Clinical Studies (14). However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy see Drug Interactions (7). Simple and Complex Absence Seizures The recommended initial dose is 15 mgkgday, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mgkgday until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mgkgday. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses. A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcgmL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). As the valproic acid capsules dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital andor phenytoin may be affected see Drug Interactions (7.2). Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. The following Table is a guide for the initial daily dose of valproic acid capsules (15 mgkgday) Table 1. Initial Daily Dose Weight Total Daily Dose (mg) Number of Capsules (Kg) (Lb) Dose 1 Dose 2 Dose 3 10  24.9 22  54.9 250 0 0 1 25  39.9 55  87.9 500 1 0 1 40  59.9 88  131.9 750 1 1 1 60  74.9 132  164.9 1,000 1 1 2 75  89.9 165  197.9 1,250 2 1 2 2.2 General Dosing Advice Dosing in Elderly Patients Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response see Warnings and Precautions (5.15), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). DoseRelated Adverse Reactions The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be doserelated. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of  110 mcgmL (females) or  135 mcgmL (males) see Warnings and Precautions (5.9). The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions. G.I. Irritation Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Valproic acid dissociates to the valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract. The mechanisms by which valproate exerts its antiepileptic effects have not been established. It has been suggested that its activity in epilepsy is related to increased brain concentrations of gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response is not well documented. One contributing factor is the nonlinear, concentration dependent protein binding of valproate which affects the clearance of the drug. Thus, monitoring of total serum valproate cannot provide a reliable index of the bioactive valproate species. For example, because the plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent, the free fraction increases from approximately 10 at 40 mcgmL to 18.5 at 130 mcgmL. Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases. Epilepsy The therapeutic range is commonly considered to be 50 to 100 mcgmL of total valproate, although some patients may be controlled with lower or higher plasma concentrations. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics AbsorptionBioavailability Equivalent oral doses of divalproex sodium products and valproic acid capsules deliver equivalent quantities of valproate ion systemically. Although the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation administered (liquid, solid, or sprinkle), conditions of use (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the method of administration (e.g., whether the contents of the capsule are sprinkled on food or the capsule is taken intact), these differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy. However, it is possible that differences among the various valproate products in Tmax and Cmax could be important upon initiation of treatment. For example, in single dose studies, the effect of feeding had a greater influence on the rate of absorption of the divalproex sodium tablet (increase in Tmax from 4 to 8 hours) than on the absorption of the divalproex sodium sprinkle capsules (increase in Tmax from 3.3 to 4.8 hours). While the absorption rate from the G.I. tract and fluctuation in valproate plasma concentrations vary with dosing regimen and formulation, the efficacy of valproate as an anticonvulsant in chronic use is unlikely to be affected. Experience employing dosing regimens from onceaday to fourtimesaday, as well as studies in primate epilepsy models involving constant rate infusion, indicate that total daily systemic bioavailability (extent of absorption) is the primary determinant of seizure control and that differences in the ratios of plasma peak to trough concentrations between valproate formulations are inconsequential from a practical clinical standpoint. Coadministration of oral valproate products with food and substitution among the various divalproex sodium and valproic acid formulations should cause no clinical problems in the management of patients with epilepsy see Dosage and Administration (2.1). Nonetheless, any changes in dosage administration, or the addition or discontinuance of concomitant drugs should ordinarily be accompanied by close monitoring of clinical status and valproate plasma concentrations. Distribution Protein Binding The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10 at 40 mcgmL to 18.5 at 130 mcgmL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain proteinbound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide). (See Drug Interactions (7.2) for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs.) CNS Distribution Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10 of total concentration). Metabolism Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 3050 of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40 of the dose. Usually, less than 1520 of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3 of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine. The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding. The kinetics of unbound drug are linear. Elimination Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 Lhr1.73 m2 and 11 L1.73 m2, respectively. Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free valproate are 4.6 Lhr1.73 m2 and 92 L1.73 m2. Mean terminal halflife for valproate monotherapy ranged from 9 to 16 hours following oral dosing regimens of 250 to 1000 mg. The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzymeinducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn. Special Populations Effect of Age Neonates Children within the first two months of life have a markedly decreased ability to eliminate valproate compared to older children and adults. This is a result of reduced clearance (perhaps due to delay in development of glucuronosyltransferase and other enzyme systems involved in valproate elimination) as well as increased volume of distribution (in part due to decreased plasma protein binding). For example, in one study, the halflife in children under 10 days ranged from 10 to 67 hours compared to a range of 7 to 13 hours in children greater than 2 months. Children Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50 higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mLminkg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults. Elderly The capacity of elderly patients (age range 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to be reduced compared to younger adults (age range 22 to 26). Intrinsic clearance is reduced by 39 the free fraction is increased by 44. Accordingly, the initial dosage should be reduced in the elderly see Dosage and Administration (2.2). Effect of Sex There are no differences in the body surface area adjusted unbound clearance between males and females (4.8  0.17 and 4.7  0.07 Lhr per 1.73 m2, respectively). Effect of Race The effects of race on the kinetics of valproate have not been studied. Effect of Disease Liver Disease See Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Liver disease impairs the capacity to eliminate valproate. In one study, the clearance of free valproate was decreased by 50 in 7 patients with cirrhosis and by 16 in 4 patients with acute hepatitis, compared with 6 healthy subjects. In that study, the halflife of valproate was increased from 12 to 18 hours. Liver disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and larger unbound fractions (2 to 2.6 fold increase) of valproate. Accordingly, monitoring of total concentrations may be misleading since free concentrations may be substantially elevated in patients with hepatic disease whereas total concentrations may appear to be normal. Renal Disease A slight reduction (27) in the unbound clearance of valproate has been reported in patients with renal failure (creatinine clearance  10 mLminute) however, hemodialysis typically reduces valproate concentrations by about 20. Therefore, no dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in patients with renal failure. Protein binding in these patients is substantially reduced thus, monitoring total concentrations may be misleading.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES The studies described in the following section were conducted using divalproex sodium tablets. 14.1 Epilepsy The efficacy of divalproex sodium tablets in reducing the incidence of complex partial seizures (CPS) that occur in isolation or in association with other seizure types was established in two controlled trials. In one, multiclinic, placebo controlled study employing an addon design (adjunctive therapy), 144 patients who continued to suffer eight or more CPS per 8 weeks during an 8 week period of monotherapy with doses of either carbamazepine or phenytoin sufficient to assure plasma concentrations within the "therapeutic range" were randomized to receive, in addition to their original antiepilepsy drug (AED), either divalproex sodium tablets or placebo. Randomized patients were to be followed for a total of 16 weeks. The following Table presents the findings. Table 5. Adjunctive Therapy Study Median Incidence of CPS per 8 Weeks Addon Treatment Number of Patients Baseline Incidence Experimental Incidence Divalproex Sodium Tablets 75 16.0 8.9Reduction from baseline statistically significantly greater for divalproex sodium tablets than placebo at p  0.05 level. Placebo 69 14.5 11.5 Figure 1 presents the proportion of patients (X axis) whose percentage reduction from baseline in complex partial seizure rates was at least as great as that indicated on the Y axis in the adjunctive therapy study. A positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. This Figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of improvement was consistently higher for divalproex sodium tablets than for placebo. For example, 45 of patients treated with divalproex sodium tablets had a  50 reduction in complex partial seizure rate compared to 23 of patients treated with placebo. Figure 1 The second study assessed the capacity of divalproex sodium tablets to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED. The study compared the incidence of CPS among patients randomized to either a high or low dose treatment arm. Patients qualified for entry into the randomized comparison phase of this study only if 1) they continued to experience 2 or more CPS per 4 weeks during an 8 to 12 week long period of monotherapy with adequate doses of an AED (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or primidone) and 2) they made a successful transition over a two week interval to divalproex sodium tablets. Patients entering the randomized phase were then brought to their assigned target dose, gradually tapered off their concomitant AED and followed for an interval as long as 22 weeks. Less than 50 of the patients randomized, however, completed the study. In patients converted to divalproex sodium tablets monotherapy, the mean total valproate concentrations during monotherapy were 71 and 123 mcgmL in the low dose and high dose groups, respectively. The following Table presents the findings for all patients randomized who had at least one postrandomization assessment. Table 6. Monotherapy Study Median Incidence of CPS per 8 Weeks Treatment Number of Patients Baseline Incidence Randomized Phase Incidence High dose 131 13.2 10.7Reduction from baseline statistically significantly greater for high dose than low dose at p  0.05 level. Divalproex Sodium Tablets Low dose 134 14.2 13.8 Divalproex Sodium Tablets Figure 2 presents the proportion of patients (X axis) whose percentage reduction from baseline in complex partial seizure rates was at least as great as that indicated on the Y axis in the monotherapy study. A positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for a more effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for a less effective treatment. This Figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction was consistently higher for high dose divalproex sodium tablets than for low dose divalproex sodium tablets. For example, when switching from carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital or primidone monotherapy to high dose divalproex sodium tablets monotherapy, 63 of patients experienced no change or a reduction in complex partial seizure rates compared to 54 of patients receiving low dose divalproex sodium tablets.

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy valproic acid capsules can cause congenital malformations including neural tube defects and decreased IQ (5.2, 5.3, 8.1) Pediatric Children under the age of two years are at considerably higher risk of fatal hepatotoxicity (5.1, 8.4) Geriatric Reduce starting dose increase dosage more slowly monitor fluid and nutritional intake, and somnolence (5.15, 8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D for epilepsy see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3). Pregnancy Registry To collect information on the effects of in utero exposure to valproic acid, physicians should encourage pregnant patients taking valproic acid capsules to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling toll free 18882332334, and must be done by the patients themselves. Information on the registry can be found at the website, httpwww.aedpregnancyregistry.org. Fetal Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects (about 3), pregnancy loss (about 15), or other adverse outcomes regardless of drug exposure. Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations). The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who used other antiseizure monotherapies see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). Exposure in utero to valproate products has been associated with cerebral atrophy see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Adverse Reactions (6.4). Several published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero see Warnings and Precautions (5.3). In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits. Clinical Considerations Neural tube defects are the congenital malformation most strongly associated with maternal valproate use. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure is generally estimated as 12, compared to an estimated general population risk for spina bifida of about 0.06 to 0.07 (6 to 7 in 10,000 births). Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores in children whose mothers were treated with valproate during pregnancy. Because of the risks of decreased IQ, neural tube defects, and other fetal adverse events, which may occur very early in pregnancy Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine). Valproic acid capsules should not be used to treat women with epilepsy who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks. When treating a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing potential, carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment and provide appropriate counseling. To prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Even minor seizures may pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. However, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy in individual cases if the seizure disorder severity and frequency do not pose a serious threat to the patient. Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered to pregnant women using valproate. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate. Patients taking valproate may develop clotting abnormalities see Warnings and Precautions (5.9). A patient who had low fibrinogen when taking multiple anticonvulsants including valproate gave birth to an infant with afibrinogenemia who subsequently died of hemorrhage. If valproate is used in pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully. Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have also been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Data Human There is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the CDCs National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is about 0.06 to 0.07. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure has been estimated to be approximately 1 to 2. In one study using NAAED Pregnancy Registry data, 16 cases of major malformations following prenatal valproate exposure were reported among offspring of 149 enrolled women who used valproate during pregnancy. Three of the 16 cases were neural tube defects the remaining cases included craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations of varying severity involving other body systems. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported a major malformation rate of 10.7 (95 C.I. 6.3  16.9) in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000 mgday of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy (dose range 5002000 mgday). The major malformation rate among the internal comparison group of 1,048 epileptic women who received any other antiepileptic drug monotherapy during pregnancy was 2.9 (95 CI 2.0 to 4.1). These data show a fourfold increased risk for any major malformation (Odds Ratio 4.0 95 CI 2.1 to 7.4) following valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to any other antiepileptic drug monotherapy. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 95 C.I. 94101) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated lamotrigine (108 95 C.I. 105110), carbamazepine (105 95 C.I. 102108) and phenytoin (108 95 C.I. 104112). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproateexposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed. Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports a causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects on cognitive development. There are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy. Animal In developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of fetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryofetal death occurred following treatment of pregnant animals with valproate during organogenesis at clinically relevant doses (calculated on a body surface area basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ systems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other malformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during critical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug levels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and brain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally to clinically relevant doses of valproate. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Valproate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when valproate is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Experience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions see Boxed Warning. When valproic acid capsules are used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of 2 years, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups. Younger children, especially those receiving enzymeinducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to attain targeted total and unbound valproic acid concentrations. Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50 higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mLminkg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults. The variability in free fraction limits the clinical usefulness of monitoring total serum valproic acid concentrations. Interpretation of valproic acid concentrations in children should include consideration of factors that affect hepatic metabolism and protein binding. Pediatric Clinical Trials Divalproex sodium tablets were studied in seven pediatric clinical trials. Two of the pediatric studies were doubleblinded placebocontrolled trials to evaluate the efficacy of divalproex sodium tablets ER for the indications of mania (150 patients aged 10 to 17 years, 76 of whom were on divalproex sodium tablets ER) and migraine (304 patients aged 12 to 17 years, 231 of whom were on divalproex sodium tablets ER). Efficacy was not established for either the treatment of migraine or the treatment of mania. The most common drugrelated adverse reactions (reported 5 and twice the rate of placebo) reported in the controlled pediatric mania study were nausea, upper abdominal pain, somnolence, increased ammonia, gastritis and rash. The remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two sixmonth pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the longterm safety of divalproex sodium tablets ER for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years). Two twelvemonth pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the longterm safety of divalproex sodium tablets ER for the indication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelvemonth study was conducted to evaluate the safety of divalproex sodium sprinkle capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years). In these seven trials, the safety and tolerability of divalproex sodium tablets in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults see Adverse Reactions (6). Juvenile Animal Toxicology In studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included retinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in rats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The noeffect dose for these findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis. 8.5 Geriatric Use No patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in doubleblind prospective clinical trials of mania associated with bipolar illness. In a case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12) were greater than 65 years of age. A higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported accidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor. Discontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear whether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness and concomitant medication use among these patients. A study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for somnolence see Warnings and Precautions (5.15). The starting dose should be reduced in these patients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive somnolence see Dosage and Administration (2.2)."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Valproate was administered orally to rats and mice at doses of 80 and 170 mgkgday (less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis) for two years. The primary findings were an increase in the incidence of subcutaneous fibrosarcomas in highdose male rats receiving valproate and a doserelated trend for benign pulmonary adenomas in male mice receiving valproate. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Valproate was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial assay (Ames test), did not produce dominant lethal effects in mice, and did not increase chromosome aberration frequency in an in vivo cytogenetic study in rats. Increased frequencies of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) have been reported in a study of epileptic children taking valproate, but this association was not observed in another study conducted in adults. There is some evidence that increased SCE frequencies may be associated with epilepsy. The biological significance of an increase in SCE frequency is not known. Fertility Chronic toxicity studies of valproate in juvenile and adult rats and dogs demonstrated reduced spermatogenesis and testicular atrophy at oral doses of 400 mgkgday or greater in rats (approximately equivalent to or greater than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mgm2 basis) and 150 mgkgday or greater in dogs (approximately 1.4 times the MRHD or greater on a mgm2 basis). Fertility studies in rats have shown no effect on fertility at oral doses of valproate up to 350 mgkgday (approximately equal to the MRHD on a mgm2 basis) for 60 days. The effect of valproate on testicular development and on sperm production and fertility in humans is unknown.</td></tr>

These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those on multiple anticonvulsants, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease. When valproic acid products are used in this patient group, they should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups. Patients with Mitochondrial Disease There is an increased risk of valproateinduced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA Polymerase  (POLG) gene (e.g. Alpers Huttenlocher Syndrome). Valproic acid is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder see Contraindications (4). In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, valproic acid should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with valproic acid for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver testing. POLG mutation screening should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Fetal Risk Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Valproate should only be used to treat pregnant women with epilepsy if other medications have failed to control their symptoms or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine). Women should use effective contraception while using valproate see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4). A Medication Guide describing the risks of valproate is available for patients see Patient Counseling Information (17). Pancreatitis Cases of lifethreatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, andor anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated see Warnings and Precautions (5.5).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with valproate may result in somnolence, heart block, and deep coma. Fatalities have been reported however, patients have recovered from valproate levels as high as 2120 mcgmL. In overdose situations, the fraction of drug not bound to protein is high and hemodialysis or tandem hemodialysis plus hemoperfusion may result in significant removal of drug. The benefit of gastric lavage or emesis will vary with the time since ingestion. General supportive measures should be applied with particular attention to the maintenance of adequate urinary output. Naloxone has been reported to reverse the CNS depressant effects of valproate overdosage. Because naloxone could theoretically also reverse the antiepileptic effects of valproate, it should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response is not well documented. One contributing factor is the nonlinear, concentration dependent protein binding of valproate which affects the clearance of the drug. Thus, monitoring of total serum valproate cannot provide a reliable index of the bioactive valproate species. For example, because the plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent, the free fraction increases from approximately 10 at 40 mcgmL to 18.5 at 130 mcgmL. Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases. Epilepsy The therapeutic range is commonly considered to be 50 to 100 mcgmL of total valproate, although some patients may be controlled with lower or higher plasma concentrations.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity evaluate high risk populations and monitor serum liver tests (5.1) Known mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase  (POLG) (4, 5.1) Suspected POLGrelated disorder in children under two years of age (4, 5.1) Birth defects and decreased IQ following in utero exposure only use to treat pregnant women with epilepsy if other medications are unacceptable should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless essential (5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Pancreatitis valproic acid capsules should ordinarily be discontinued (5.5) Brain Atrophy evaluate for continued use in the presence of suspected or apparent signs of reversible or irreversible cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (5.6) Suicidal behavior or ideation Antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior (5.8) Thrombocytopenia monitor platelet counts and coagulation tests (5.9) Hyperammonemia and hyperammonemic encephalopathy measure ammonia level if unexplained lethargy and <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b> or changes in mental status (5.10, 5.11) Hypothermia Hypothermia has been reported during valproate therapy with or without associated hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate (5.12) Multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction discontinue valproic acid capsules (5.13) Somnolence in the elderly can occur. Valproic acid capsules dosage should be increased slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake (5.15) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity General Information on Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months. However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination. Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. See below, "Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease." Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When valproic acid capsules products are used in this patient group, they should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably. Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease Valproic acid capsules are contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder see Contraindications (4). Valproateinduced acute liver failure and liverrelated deaths have been reported in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by mutations in the gene for mitochondrial DNA polymerase  (POLG) (e.g., AlpersHuttenlocher Syndrome) at a higher rate than those without these syndromes. Most of the reported cases of liver failure in patients with these syndromes have been identified in children and adolescents. POLGrelated disorders should be suspected in patients with a family history or suggestive symptoms of a POLGrelated disorder, including but not limited to unexplained encephalopathy, refractory epilepsy (focal, myoclonic), status epilepticus at presentation, developmental delays, psychomotor regression, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, myopathy cerebellar ataxia, opthalmoplegia, or complicated migraine with occipital aura. POLG mutation testing should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice for the diagnostic evaluation of such disorders. The A467T and W748S mutations are present in approximately 23 of patients with autosomal recessive POLGrelated disorders. In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, valproic acid capsules should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with valproic acid capsules for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver test monitoring. The drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction, suspected or apparent. In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation of drug see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4). 5.2 Birth Defects Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations involving various body systems). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other antiseizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. 5.3 Decreased IQ Following in utero Exposure Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies1 is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 95 C.I. 94101) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated lamotrigine (108 95 C.I. 105110), carbamazepine (105 95 C.I. 102108), and phenytoin (108 95 C.I. 104112). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproateexposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed. Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can cause decreased IQ in children. In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits see Use in Specific Populations (8.1). Women with epilepsy who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant should not be treated with valproate unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks. 5.4 Use in Women of Childbearing Potential Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ and major congenital malformations (including neural tube defects), which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine). Women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks and benefits of valproate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.1). To prevent major seizures, valproate should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate. 5.5 Pancreatitis Cases of lifethreatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and there have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate. In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2416 patients, representing 1044 patientyears experience. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, andor anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated see Boxed Warning. 5.6 Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD) Valproic acid is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Prior to the initiation of valproate therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients 1) those with a history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancyrelated or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine 2) those with cyclical <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b> and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males) 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD. Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.11). 5.7 Brain Atrophy There have been postmarketing reports of reversible and irreversible cerebral and cerebellar atrophy temporally associated with the use valproate products in some cases, patients recovered with permanent sequelae see Adverse Reactions (6.4). The motor and cognitive functions of patients on valproate should be routinely monitored and drug should be evaluated for continued use in the presence of suspected or apparent signs of brain atrophy. Reports of cerebral atrophy have also been reported in children who were exposed in utero to valproate products see Use in Specific Populations (8.1). 5.8 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including valproic acid capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, andor any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebocontrolled clinical trials (mono and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95 CI1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AEDtreated patients was 0.43, compared to 0.24 among 16,029 placebotreated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drugtreated patients in the trials and none in placebotreated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 2. Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk Incidence of Events in Drug PatientsIncidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing valproic acid capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about selfharm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia may be doserelated. In a clinical trial of divalproex sodium as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34126 patients (27) receiving approximately 50 mgkgday on average, had at least one value of platelets  75  109L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of  110 mcgmL (females) or  135 mcgmL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects. Because of reports of thrombocytopenia, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen), platelet counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients receiving valproic acid capsules be monitored for platelet count and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasiscoagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy. 5.10 Hyperammonemia Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b> or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia see Warnings and Precautions (5.12). If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.11). Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered. 5.11 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy Associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness andor cognitive function with lethargy or <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>. Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia see Warnings and Precautions (5.12). In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. It is not known if topiramate monotherapy is associated with hyperammonemia. Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.10). 5.12 Hypothermia Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to 35C (95F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate see Drug Interactions (7.3). Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels. 5.13 MultiOrgan Hypersensitivity Reactions Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported in close temporal association to the initiation of valproate therapy in adult and pediatric patients (median time to detection 21 days range 1 to 40 days). Although there have been a limited number of reports, many of these cases resulted in hospitalization and at least one death has been reported. Signs and symptoms of this disorder were diverse however, patients typically, although not exclusively, presented with fever and rash associated with other organ system involvement. Other associated manifestations may include lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, hematological abnormalities (e.g., eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), pruritus, nephritis, oliguria, hepatorenal syndrome, arthralgia, and asthenia. Because the disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system symptoms and signs, not noted here, may occur. If this reaction is suspected, valproate should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started. Although the existence of cross sensitivity with other drugs that produce this syndrome is unclear, the experience amongst drugs associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity would indicate this to be a possibility. 5.14 Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics Carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem this is not a complete list) may reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure control. Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates see Drug Interactions (7.1). 5.15 Somnolence in the Elderly In a doubleblind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age  83 years), doses were increased by 125 mgday to a target dose of 20 mgkgday. A significantly higher proportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically significant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration. Discontinuations for somnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo. In some patients with somnolence (approximately onehalf), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss. There was a trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin concentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN. In elderly patients, dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence see Dosage and Administration (2.2). 5.16 Monitoring Drug Plasma Concentration Since valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy see Drug Interactions (7). 5.17 Effect on Ketone and Thyroid Function Tests Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a ketometabolite which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. There have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate. The clinical significance of these is unknown. 5.18 Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication There are in vitro studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV viruses under certain experimental conditions. The clinical consequence, if any, is not known. Additionally, the relevance of these in vitro findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when interpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving valproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Sulfamethoxazole was not carcinogenic when assessed in a 26week tumorigenic mouse (TgrasH2) study at doses up to 400 mgkgday sulfamethoxazole equivalent to 2.4fold the human systemic exposure (at a daily dose of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole b.i.d.). Mutagenesis In vitro reverse mutation bacterial tests according to the standard protocol have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. An in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes with sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim was negative. In in vitro and in vivo tests in animal species, sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim did not damage chromosomes. In vivo micronucleus assays were positive following oral administration of sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim revealed no chromosomal abnormalities. Sulfamethoxazole alone was positive in an in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assay and in in vitro micronucleus assays using cultured human lymphocytes. Trimethoprim alone was negative in in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assays and in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays with Chinese Hamster ovary or lung cells with or without S9 activation. In in vitro Comet, micronucleus and chromosomal damage assays using cultured human lymphocytes, trimethoprim was positive. In mice following oral administration of trimethoprim, no DNA damage in Comet assays of liver, kidney, lung, spleen, or bone marrow was recorded. Impairment of Fertility No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were observed in rats given oral dosages as high as 350 mgkgday sulfamethoxazole plus 70 mgkgday trimethoprim, doses roughly two times the recommended human daily dose on a body surface area basis.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy While there are no large, wellcontrolled studies on the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pregnant women, Brumfitt and Pursell,10 in a retrospective study, reported the outcome of 186 pregnancies during which the mother received either placebo or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The incidence of congenital abnormalities was 4.5 (3 of 66) in those who received placebo and 3.3 (4 of 120) in those receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. There were no abnormalities in the 10 children whose mothers received the drug during the first trimester. In a separate survey, Brumfitt and Pursell also found no congenital abnormalities in 35 children whose mothers had received oral sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at the time of conception or shortly thereafter. Because sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D. Human Data While there are no large prospective, well controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. These studies, however, were limited by the small number of exposed cases and the lack of adjustment for multiple statistical comparisons and confounders. These studies are further limited by recall, selection, and information biases, and by limited generalizability of their findings. Lastly, outcome measures varied between studies, limiting crossstudy comparisons. Alternatively, other epidemiologic studies did not detect statistically significant associations between sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim exposure and specific malformations. Animal Data In rats, oral doses of either 533 mgkg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mgkg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly as cleft palates. These doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mgkg of sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mgkg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area. Nonteratogenic Effects See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg were studied in 6 geriatric subjects (mean age 78.6 years) and 6 young healthy subjects (mean age 29.3 years) using a nonUS approved formulation. Pharmacokinetic values for sulfamethoxazole in geriatric subjects were similar to those observed in young adult subjects. The mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was significantly lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects (19 mLhkg vs. 55 mLhkg). However, after normalizing by body weight, the apparent total body clearance of trimethoprim was on average 19 lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects.3</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>PRECAUTIONS Development of drug resistant bacteria Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drugresistant bacteria. Folate deficiency Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be given with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, to those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states) and to those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Hemolysis In glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently doserelated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hypoglycemia Cases of hypoglycemia in nondiabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk. Phenylalanine metabolism Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction. Porphyria and Hypothyroidism As with all drugs containing sulfonamides, caution is advisable in patients with porphyria or thyroid dysfunction. Use in the Treatment of and Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the same manner as nonAIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for P. jiroveci pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in nonAIDS patients. Adverse effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of subsequent secondary prophylaxis.7 However, if a patient develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated (see WARNINGS ). Coadministration of sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim and leucovorin should be avoided with P. jiroveci pneumonia (see WARNINGS). Electrolyte Abnormalities High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with P. jiroveci pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, particularly for the treatment of P. jiroveci pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent lifethreatening complications. During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim if a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued. Urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests should be performed during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Drug Interactions Potential for Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim to Affect Other Drugs Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Caution is recommended when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is coadministered with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2. In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). This interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin (a CYP2C9 substrate). Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin halflife by 39 and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect. Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations. There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin. Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is prescribed. The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when coadministered with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemics that are metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (e.g., glipizide and glyburide) or eliminated renally via OCT2 (e.g., metformin). Additional monitoring of blood glucose may be warranted. In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium has been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim and amantadine (an OCT2 substrate). Cases of interactions with other OCT2 substrates, memantine and metformin, have also been reported. In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.8,9 DrugLaboratory Test Interactions Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). The presence of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may also interfere with the Jaff alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10 in the range of normal values. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Sulfamethoxazole was not carcinogenic when assessed in a 26week tumorigenic mouse (TgrasH2) study at doses up to 400 mgkgday sulfamethoxazole equivalent to 2.4fold the human systemic exposure (at a daily dose of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole b.i.d.). Mutagenesis In vitro reverse mutation bacterial tests according to the standard protocol have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. An in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes with sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim was negative. In in vitro and in vivo tests in animal species, sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim did not damage chromosomes. In vivo micronucleus assays were positive following oral administration of sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim revealed no chromosomal abnormalities. Sulfamethoxazole alone was positive in an in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assay and in in vitro micronucleus assays using cultured human lymphocytes. Trimethoprim alone was negative in in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assays and in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays with Chinese Hamster ovary or lung cells with or without S9 activation. In in vitro Comet, micronucleus and chromosomal damage assays using cultured human lymphocytes, trimethoprim was positive. In mice following oral administration of trimethoprim, no DNA damage in Comet assays of liver, kidney, lung, spleen, or bone marrow was recorded. Impairment of Fertility No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were observed in rats given oral dosages as high as 350 mgkgday sulfamethoxazole plus 70 mgkgday trimethoprim, doses roughly two times the recommended human daily dose on a body surface area basis.

In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area. Nonteratogenic Effects See CONTRAINDICATIONS section. Nursing Mothers Levels of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole in breast milk are approximately 25 of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. Caution should be exercised when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding, jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus. Pediatric Use Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of age (see INDICATIONS and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney andor liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). The trimethoprim component of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim DS tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Geriatric Pharmacokinetics ).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>"INDICATIONS AND USAGE To reduce the development of drugresistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy. Urinary Tract Infections For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination. Acute Otitis Media For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age. Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when a physician deems that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim could offer some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent. Shigellosis For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated. Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and for prophylaxis against P. jiroveci pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing P. jiroveci pneumonia. Travelers Diarrhea in Adults For the treatment of travelers diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli."</td></tr>

Aerobic grampositive microorganisms Streptococcus pneumoniae Aerobic gramnegative microorganisms Escherichia coli (including susceptible enterotoxigenic strains implicated in travelers diarrhea) Klebsiella species Enterobacter species Haemophilus influenzae Morganella morganii Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Shigella flexneri Shigella sonnei Other Organisms Pneumocystis jiroveci Susceptibility Testing Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drug products used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and communityacquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment. Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth or agar)4,15. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method14,15. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 1.2523.75 g of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The disc diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1.

A report of Intermediate indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site other therapy should be selected."</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Embryofetal Toxicity Some epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. If sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be advised of the potential hazards to the fetus. Hypersensitivity and Other Fatal Reactions Fatalities associated with the administration of sulfonamides, although rare, have occurred due to severe reactions, including StevensJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Sulfonamides, including sulfonamidecontaining products such as sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim, should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction. In rare instances, a skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as StevensJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis, and serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS ). Clinical signs, such as rash, sore throat, fever, arthralgia, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions. Cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltrates are hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract that have been reported in association with sulfonamide treatment. Thrombocytopenia Sulfamethoxazoletrimethopriminduced thrombocytopenia may be an immunemediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim. Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A hemolytic streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Adjunctive treatment with Leucovorin for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in a randomized placebo controlled trial.6 Coadministration of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and leucovorin during treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia should be avoided.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim exist in the blood as unbound, proteinbound and metabolized forms sulfamethoxazole also exists as the conjugated form. Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in humans to at least 5 metabolites the N4acetyl, N4hydroxy, 5methylhydroxy, N4acetyl 5methylhydroxy sulfamethoxazole metabolites, and an Nglucuronide conjugate. The formulation of N4hydroxy metabolite is mediated via CYP2C9. Trimethoprim is metabolized in vitro to 11 different metabolites, of which, five are glutathione adducts and six are oxidative metabolites, including the major metabolites, 1 and 3oxides and the 3 and 4hydroxy derivatives. The free forms of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considered to be the therapeutically active forms. In vitro studies suggest that trimethoprim is a substrate of Pglycoprotein, OCT1 and OCT2, and that sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of Pglycoprotein. Approximately 70 of sulfamethoxazole and 44 of trimethoprim are bound to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent sulfamethoxazole in plasma decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim by an insignificant degree trimethoprim does not influence the protein binding of sulfamethoxazole. Peak blood levels for the individual components occur 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum halflives of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are 10 and 8 to 10 hours, respectively. However, patients with severely impaired renal function exhibit an increase in the halflives of both components, requiring dosage regimen adjustment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Detectable amounts of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are present in the blood 24 hours after drug administration. During administration of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim b.i.d., the mean steadystate plasma concentration of trimethoprim was 1.72 gmL. The steadystate mean plasma levels of free and total sulfamethoxazole were 57.4 gmL and 68.0 gmL, respectively. These steadystate levels were achieved after three days of drug administration.1 Excretion of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is primarily by the kidneys through both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Urine concentrations of both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considerably higher than are the concentrations in the blood. The average percentage of the dose recovered in urine from 0 to 72 hours after a single oral dose of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is 84.5 for total sulfonamide and 66.8 for free trimethoprim. Thirty percent of the total sulfonamide is excreted as free sulfamethoxazole, with the remaining as N4acetylated metabolite.2 When administered together as sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, neither sulfamethoxazole nor trimethoprim affects the urinary excretion pattern of the other. Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim distribute to sputum, vaginal fluid and middle ear fluid trimethoprim also distributes to bronchial secretion, and both pass the placental barrier and are excreted in human milk. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg were studied in 6 geriatric subjects (mean age 78.6 years) and 6 young healthy subjects (mean age 29.3 years) using a nonUS approved formulation. Pharmacokinetic values for sulfamethoxazole in geriatric subjects were similar to those observed in young adult subjects. The mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was significantly lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects (19 mLhkg vs. 55 mLhkg). However, after normalizing by body weight, the apparent total body clearance of trimethoprim was on average 19 lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects.3 Microbiology Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA). Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. Thus, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim blocks two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins essential to many bacteria. In vitro studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination than with either sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim alone.

Aerobic grampositive microorganisms Streptococcus pneumoniae Aerobic gramnegative microorganisms Escherichia coli (including susceptible enterotoxigenic strains implicated in travelers diarrhea) Klebsiella species Enterobacter species Haemophilus influenzae Morganella morganii Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Shigella flexneri Shigella sonnei Other Organisms Pneumocystis jiroveci Susceptibility Testing Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drug products used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and communityacquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment. Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth or agar)4,15. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method14,15. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 1.2523.75 g of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The disc diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1. Table 1 Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for TrimethoprimSulfamethoxazole Bacteria Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (mcgmL) Zone Diameter (mm) S I R S I R Enterobacteriaceae  238   476  16 11  15  10 Haemophilus influenzae  0.59.5 119  238  476  16 11  15  10 Streptococcus pneumoniae  0.59.5 119  238  476  19 16  18  15 A report of Susceptible indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations at the site of infection necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen. A report of Intermediate indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site other therapy should be selected. Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay and the techniques of the individuals performing the test4,14,15. Standard trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2. For the diffusion technique using the 1.2523.75 g trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole disk the criteria in Table 2 should be achieved.

<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Geriatric Use Clinical studies of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney andor liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). The trimethoprim component of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim DS tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Geriatric Pharmacokinetics ).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_and_or_laboratory_test_interactions</i>:</td><td>DrugLaboratory Test Interactions Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). The presence of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may also interfere with the Jaff alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10 in the range of normal values.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>overdosage</i>:</td><td>OVERDOSAGE Acute The amount of a single dose of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim that is either associated with symptoms of overdosage or is likely to be lifethreatening has not been reported. Signs and symptoms of overdosage reported with sulfonamides include anorexia, colic, nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, dizziness, headache, drowsiness and unconsciousness. Pyrexia, hematuria and crystalluria may be noted. Blood dyscrasias and jaundice are potential late manifestations of overdosage. Signs of acute overdosage with trimethoprim include nausea, <b style='color:red'>vomiting</b>, dizziness, headache, mental depression, confusion and bone marrow depression. General principles of treatment include the institution of gastric lavage or emesis, forcing oral fluids, and the administration of intravenous fluids if urine output is low and renal function is normal. Acidification of the urine will increase renal elimination of trimethoprim. The patient should be monitored with blood counts and appropriate blood chemistries, including electrolytes. If a significant blood dyscrasia or jaundice occurs, specific therapy should be instituted for these complications. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective and hemodialysis is only moderately effective in eliminating sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Chronic Use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at high doses andor for extended periods of time may cause bone marrow depression manifested as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia andor megaloblastic anemia. If signs of bone marrow depression occur, the patient should be given leucovorin 5 to 15 mg daily until normal hematopoiesis is restored.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D. Human Data While there are no large prospective, well controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. These studies, however, were limited by the small number of exposed cases and the lack of adjustment for multiple statistical comparisons and confounders. These studies are further limited by recall, selection, and information biases, and by limited generalizability of their findings. Lastly, outcome measures varied between studies, limiting crossstudy comparisons. Alternatively, other epidemiologic studies did not detect statistically significant associations between sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim exposure and specific malformations. Animal Data In rats, oral doses of either 533 mgkg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mgkg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly as cleft palates. These doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mgkg of sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mgkg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area.</td></tr>
