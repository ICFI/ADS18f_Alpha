<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at (18004381985 and www.pfizer.com) or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>

Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 6.) TABLE 6. Dose Response in Patients With Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean  Change From Baseline)Results are pooled from 2 doseresponse studies.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL.

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained andor persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday.

These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine Do not exceed 10 mg atorvastatin daily Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir) Caution when exceeding doses  20 mg atorvastatin daily. The lowest dose necessary should be used. Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.5). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.6). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.4). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg with ritonavir plus saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 20 mg with lopinavir plus ritonavir (400 mg  100 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking HIV protease inhibitors, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . In cases where coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine is necessary, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 10 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Rifamprin or other Induceder of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.7 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion. image of chemical structure</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or a Combination of Ritonavir plus Saquinavir or Lopinavir plus Ritonavir In patients taking cyclosporine, therapy should be limited to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg once daily. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, for doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> exceeding 20 mg, appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label Rhabdomyolysis and myopathy see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  Liver enzyme abnormalities see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2) in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebocontrolled trials regardless of causality were nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhea, pain in extremity, and urinary tract infection (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at (18004381985 and www.pfizer.com) or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,305 participants (age range 4080 years, 19 women 94.6 Caucasians, 2.6 Africans, 1.5 South Asians, 1.3 mixedother) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5,168) or placebo (n5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of followup. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, hepatic failure, dizziness, memory impairment, depression, and peripheral neuropathy. 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>

Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased.

Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. image of figure 1 image of figure 2 image of figure 3 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG.

In patients with Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia pooled from 24 controlled trials, the median (25th and 75th percentile) percent changes from baseline in HDLC for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg were 6.4 (1.4, 14), 8.7 (0, 17), 7.8 (0, 16), and 5.1 (2.7, 15), respectively. Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Enter section text here Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans.

Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine, fibrates, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. In cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued (5.1). Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, immunosuppressive drugs, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine Do not exceed 10 mg atorvastatin daily Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir) Caution when exceeding doses  20mg atorvastatin daily. The lowest dose necessary should be used. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter. Liver enzyme changes generally occur in the first 3 months of treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Should an increase in ALT or AST of 3 times ULN persist, reduction of dose or withdrawal of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recommended. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients with HIV taking nelfinavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at (18004381985 and www.pfizer.com) or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,305 participants (age range 4080 years, 19 women 94.6 Caucasians, 2.6 Africans, 1.5 South Asians, 1.3 mixedother) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5,168) or placebo (n5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of followup. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>

Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. Figure Figure Figure 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 6.) TABLE 6. Dose Response in Patients With Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean  Change From Baseline)Results are pooled from 2 doseresponse studies.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

The safety and efficacy of doses above 20 mg have not been studied in controlled trials in children. The longterm efficacy of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. In cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine Do not exceed 10 mg atorvastatin daily Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir) Caution when exceeding doses  20 mg atorvastatin daily. The lowest dose necessary should be used. Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.5). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.6). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.4). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg with ritonavir plus saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 20 mg with lopinavir plus ritonavir (400 mg  100 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking HIV protease inhibitors, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . In cases where coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine is necessary, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 10 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.7 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.</td></tr>

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your condition or treatment. If you have any questions about <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, ask your doctor or pharmacist. What is <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>? <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a prescription medicine that lowers cholesterol in your blood. It lowers the LDLC ("bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides in your blood. It can raise your HDLC ("good" cholesterol) as well. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is for adults and children over 10 whose cholesterol does not come down enough with exercise and a lowfat diet alone. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can lower the risk for heart attack, stroke, certain types of heart surgery, and chest pain in patients who have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease such as age, smoking, high blood pressure, low HDLC, heart disease in the family. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can lower the risk for heart attack or stroke in patients with diabetes and risk factors such as eye problems, kidney problems, smoking, or high blood pressure. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> starts to work in about 2 weeks. What is Cholesterol? Cholesterol and triglycerides are fats that are made in your body. They are also found in foods. You need some cholesterol for good health, but too much is not good for you. Cholesterol and triglycerides can clog your blood vessels. It is especially important to lower your cholesterol if you have heart disease, smoke, have diabetes or high blood pressure, are older, or if heart disease starts early in your family. Who Should Not Take <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>? Do not take <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may harm your unborn baby.

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or a Combination of Ritonavir plus Saquinavir or Lopinavir plus Ritonavir In patients taking cyclosporine, therapy should be limited to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg once daily. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, for doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> exceeding 20 mg, appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, hepatic failure, dizziness, memory impairment, depression, and peripheral neuropathy. 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5).

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine, fibrates, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. In cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued (5.1). Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, immunosuppressive drugs, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine Do not exceed 10 mg atorvastatin daily Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir) Caution when exceeding doses  20mg atorvastatin daily. The lowest dose necessary should be used. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter. Liver enzyme changes generally occur in the first 3 months of treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Should an increase in ALT or AST of 3 times ULN persist, reduction of dose or withdrawal of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recommended. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at (18004381985 and www.pfizer.com) or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,305 participants (age range 4080 years, 19 women 94.6 Caucasians, 2.6 Africans, 1.5 South Asians, 1.3 mixedother) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5,168) or placebo (n5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of followup. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 6.) TABLE 6. Dose Response in Patients With Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean  Change From Baseline)Results are pooled from 2 doseresponse studies.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained andor persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>precautions</i>:</td><td>"PRECAUTIONS General Before instituting therapy with atorvastatin, an attempt should be made to control hypercholesterolemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight reduction in obese patients, and to treat other underlying medical problems (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Information for Patients Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. Drug Interactions The risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin or cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azole antifungals) (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle). Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 Atorvastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depends on the variability of effect on cytochrome P450 3A4. Clarithromycin Concomitant administration of atorvastatin 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 4.4fold increase in atorvastatin AUC (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Erythromycin In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40 with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle). Combination of Protease Inhibitors Concomitant administration of atorvastatin 40 mg with ritonavir plus saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 3fold increase in atorvastatin AUC. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin 20 mg with lopinavir plus ritonavir (400 mg100 mg twice daily) resulted in a 5.9fold increase in atorvastatin AUC (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Itraconazole Concomitant administration of atorvastatin (20 to 40 mg) and itraconazole (200 mg) was associated with a 2.53.3fold increase in atorvastatin AUC. Diltiazem hydrochloride Coadministration of atorvastatin (40 mg) with diltiazem (240 mg) was associated with higher plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Cimetidine Atorvastatin plasma concentrations and LDLC reduction were not altered by coadministration of cimetidine. Grapefruit juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g. cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday resulted in an 8.7fold increase in atorvastatin AUC. In cases where coadministration of atorvastatin with cyclosporine is necessary, the dose of atorvastatin should not exceed 10 mg (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle). Inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (eg efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of atorvastatin with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. Antacid When atorvastatin and Maalox TC suspension were coadministered, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35. However, LDLC reduction was not altered. Antipyrine Because atorvastatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, interactions with other drugs metabolized via the same cytochrome isozymes are not expected. Colestipol Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25 when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDLC reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone. Digoxin When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steadystate plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30 and 20. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin. Warfarin Atorvastatin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. Amlodipine In a drugdrug interaction study in healthy subjects, coadministration of atorvastatin 80 mg and amlodipine 10 mg resulted in an 18 increase in exposure to atorvastatin which was not clinically meaningful. Endocrine Function HMGCoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if an HMGCoA reductase inhibitor is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X See CONTRAINDICATIONS Safety in pregnant women has not been established. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2). In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eye opening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Rare reports of congenital anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to HMGCoA reductase inhibitors. There has been one report of severe congenital bony deformity, tracheoesophageal fistula, and anal atresia (VATER association) in a baby born to a woman who took lovastatin with dextroamphetamine sulfate during the first trimester of pregnancy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not breastfeed (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo, the most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no detectable effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies section ADVERSE REACTIONS, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age). Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia). Geriatric Use The safety and efficacy of atorvastatin (1080 mg) in the geriatric population (65 years of age) was evaluated in the ACCESS study. In this 54week openlabel trial 1,958 patients initiated therapy with atorvastatin 10 mg. Of these, 835 were elderly (65 years) and 1,123 were nonelderly. The mean change in LDLC from baseline after 6 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg was 38.2 in the elderly patients versus 34.6 in the nonelderly group. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were similar between the two age groups. There were no differences in clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities between the age groups. Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo. Subjects with hemorrhagic stroke on study entry appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>Drug Interactions The risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin or cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azole antifungals) (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle). Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 Atorvastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depends on the variability of effect on cytochrome P450 3A4. Clarithromycin Concomitant administration of atorvastatin 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 4.4fold increase in atorvastatin AUC (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Erythromycin In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40 with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle). Combination of Protease Inhibitors Concomitant administration of atorvastatin 40 mg with ritonavir plus saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 3fold increase in atorvastatin AUC. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin 20 mg with lopinavir plus ritonavir (400 mg100 mg twice daily) resulted in a 5.9fold increase in atorvastatin AUC (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Itraconazole Concomitant administration of atorvastatin (20 to 40 mg) and itraconazole (200 mg) was associated with a 2.53.3fold increase in atorvastatin AUC. Diltiazem hydrochloride Coadministration of atorvastatin (40 mg) with diltiazem (240 mg) was associated with higher plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Cimetidine Atorvastatin plasma concentrations and LDLC reduction were not altered by coadministration of cimetidine. Grapefruit juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day).

Lipidaltering agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol only when the response to diet and other nonpharmacological measures has been inadequate (see National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Guidelines, summarized in Table 7). TABLE 7. NCEP Treatment Guidelines LDLC Goals and Cutpoints for Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes and Drug Therapy in Different Risk Categories Risk Category LDLC Goal (mgdL) LDL Level at Which to Initiate Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (mgdL) LDL Level at Which to Consider Drug Therapy (mgdL) CHD CHD, coronary heart disease or CHD risk equivalents (10year risk 20) 100 100 130 (100129 drug optional) Some authorities recommend use of LDLlowering drugs in this category if an LDLC level of  100 mgdL cannot be achieved by therapeutic lifestyle changes. Others prefer use of drugs that primarily modify triglycerides and HDLC, e.g., nicotinic acid or fibrate. Clinical judgement also may call for deferring drug therapy in this subcategory. 2 Risk Factors (10year risk 20) 130 130 10year risk 1020 130 10year risk 10  160 01 Risk factor Almost all people with 01 risk factor have 10year risk 10 thus, 10year risk assessment in people with 01 risk factor is not necessary. 160 160 190 (160189 LDLlowering drug optional) After the LDLC goal has been achieved, if the TG is still 200 mgdL, nonHDLC (totalC minus HDLC) becomes a secondary target of therapy. NonHDLC goals are set 30 mgdL higher than LDLC goals for each risk category. Prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, secondary causes for hypercholesterolemia (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, and alcoholism) should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to measure totalC, LDLC, HDLC, and TG. For patients with TG 400 mgdL (4.5 mmolL), LDLC can be estimated using the following equation LDLC  totalC  (0.20  TG  HDLC). For TG levels 400 mgdL (4.5 mmolL), this equation is less accurate and LDLC concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in conditions where the major lipoprotein abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons (Fredrickson Types I and V).

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterollowering diet before receiving <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and should continue on this diet during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see NCEP Guidelines, summarized in Table 7). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDLC, the NCEP recommends that LDLC levels be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDLC levels are not available, should totalC be used to monitor therapy. Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy (see NCEP Pediatric Panel GuidelinesNational Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Highlights of the Report of the Expert Panel on Blood Cholesterol Levels in Children Adolescents, Pediatrics. 89(3)495501. 1992., CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. Concomitant Lipid Lowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used in combination with a bile acid binding resin for additive effect. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates should generally be avoided (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle, and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions for other drugdrug interactions). Dosage in Patients With Renal Insufficiency Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of atorvastatin thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin or A Combination of Ritonavir plus Saquinavir or Lopinavir plus Ritonavir In patients taking cyclosporine, therapy should be limited to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg once daily. In patients taking clarithromycin or in patients with HIV taking a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, for doses of atorvastatin exceeding 20 mg appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is employed (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle, and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Pregnancy and Lactation Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol and other products of cholesterol biosynthesis are essential components for fetal development (including synthesis of steroids and cell membranes). Since HMGCoA reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol, they may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore, HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy and in nursing mothers. ATORVASTATIN SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo, the most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no detectable effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies section ADVERSE REACTIONS, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age). Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age.

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (atorvastatin calcium) is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino) carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile, slightly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40 or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion. Chemical Structure</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS Liver Dysfunction HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin. It is recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter. Liver enzyme changes generally occur in the first 3 months of treatment with atorvastatin. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Should an increase in ALT or AST of 3 times ULN persist, reduction of dose or withdrawal of atorvastatin is recommended. Atorvastatin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of atorvastatin (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with atorvastatin and with other drugs in this class. Uncomplicated myalgia has been reported in atorvastatintreated patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN, should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. Atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with atorvastatin and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, immunosuppressive drugs, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (See DRUG INTERACTIONS). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Atorvastatin therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures).</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>Mechanism of Action Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cellsurface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>geriatric_use</i>:</td><td>Geriatric Use The safety and efficacy of atorvastatin (1080 mg) in the geriatric population (65 years of age) was evaluated in the ACCESS study. In this 54week openlabel trial 1,958 patients initiated therapy with atorvastatin 10 mg. Of these, 835 were elderly (65 years) and 1,123 were nonelderly. The mean change in LDLC from baseline after 6 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg was 38.2 in the elderly patients versus 34.6 in the nonelderly group. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were similar between the two age groups. There were no differences in clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities between the age groups.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>Clinical Studies Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (atorvastatin calcium) on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdl (6.5 mmoll). Additionally all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients, 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of Nonfatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (atorvastatin calcium) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 White, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL 160 mgdL and TG 600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg day on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48,0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. Figure 2. Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31,0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs 82 deaths in the placebo group, (HR 0.73, p0.059). In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98 and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129 and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80mgday group vs 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69,0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 1).

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 1). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45 and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47 and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78,1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group.

Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hypercholesterolemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. Experience in pediatric patients has been limited to patients with homozygous FH. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hypercholesterolemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG (Pooled results are provided in Table 2).

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hypercholesterolemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other HMGCoA reductase inhibitors. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 3). TABLE 3.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26 week doubleblind phase (see Table 6).

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cellsurface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Pharmacodynamics Atorvastatin as well as some of its metabolites are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage rather than systemic drug concentration correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism Absorption Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether atorvastatin is given with or without food. Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Distribution Mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, Pregnancy and Lactation, and PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers). Metabolism Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of atorvastatin. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration. Special Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults (see PRECAUTIONS section Geriatric Use subsection). Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Insufficiency Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of atorvastatin thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of atorvastatin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Insufficiency In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Clinical Studies Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (atorvastatin calcium) on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdl (6.5 mmoll). Additionally all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients, 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of Nonfatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (atorvastatin calcium) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 White, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL 160 mgdL and TG 600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg day on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48,0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. Figure 2. Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31,0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs 82 deaths in the placebo group, (HR 0.73, p0.059). In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98 and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129 and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80mgday group vs 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69,0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 1). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender. Figure 3.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 1). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45 and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47 and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78,1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group.

Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS. Figure 3. Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs.10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events (TNT) Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hypercholesterolemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. Experience in pediatric patients has been limited to patients with homozygous FH. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hypercholesterolemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG (Pooled results are provided in Table 2).

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hypercholesterolemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other HMGCoA reductase inhibitors. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 3). TABLE 3.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26 week doubleblind phase (see Table 6).

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients with HIV taking nelfinavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at (18004381985 and www.pfizer.com) or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,305 participants (age range 4080 years, 19 women 94.6 Caucasians, 2.6 Africans, 1.5 South Asians, 1.3 mixedother) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5,168) or placebo (n5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of followup. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>

Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. Figure Figure Figure 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. In cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at (18004381985 and www.pfizer.com) or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4).

Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>

Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. Figure Figure Figure 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained andor persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday.

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at (18004381985 and www.pfizer.com) or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>

Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 6.) TABLE 6. Dose Response in Patients With Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean  Change From Baseline)Results are pooled from 2 doseresponse studies.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL.

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained andor persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday.

These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels (4.1). Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant (4.3). Nursing mothers (4.4). Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication (4.2). Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be advised that cholesterol is a chronic condition and they should adhere to their medication along with their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)recommended diet, a regular exercise program as appropriate, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel to determine goal attainment. Patients should be advised about substances they should not take concomitantly with atorvastatin see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Patients should also be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. All patients starting therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be advised of the risk of myopathy and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if these muscle signs or symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. The risk of this occurring is increased when taking certain types of medication or consuming larger quantities (1 liter) of grapefruit juice. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their healthcare professional. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before the initiation of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur. All patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be advised to report promptly any symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. Women of childbearing age should be advised to use an effective method of birth control to prevent pregnancy while using <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Discuss future pregnancy plans with your patients, and discuss when to stop <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> if they are trying to conceive. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant, they should stop taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and call their healthcare professional. Women who are breastfeeding should be advised to not use <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Patients who have a lipid disorder and are breastfeeding, should be advised to discuss the options with their healthcare professional.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed.

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

The increase in atorvastatin exposure when used clinically is likely to be higher than what was observed in this study. Therefore, caution should be applied and the lowest dose necessary should be used. Greater increases in AUC (up to 2.5 fold) andor Cmax (up to 71) have been reported with excessive grapefruit consumption ( 750 mL  1.2 liters per day). Single sample taken 816 h post dose. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of atorvastatin with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL STUDIES In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5).

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained andor persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Use with caution and with the lowest dose necessary ( Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine Do not exceed 10 mg atorvastatin daily Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir) Caution when exceeding doses  20 mg atorvastatin daily. The lowest dose necessary should be used. Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.5). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.6). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.4). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg with ritonavir plus saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 20 mg with lopinavir plus ritonavir (400 mg  100 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking HIV protease inhibitors, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . In cases where coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine is necessary, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 10 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.7 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.</td></tr>

Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with CHD or multiple risk factors for CHD, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be started simultaneously with diet. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is an inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase (statin) indicated as an adjunct therapy to diet to Reduce the risk of MI, stroke, revascularization procedures, and angina in patients without CHD, but with multiple risk factors (1.1). Reduce the risk of MI and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes without CHD, but with multiple risk factors (1.1). Reduce the risk of nonfatal MI, fatal and nonfatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for CHF, and angina in patients with CHD (1.1). Reduce elevated totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG levels and increase HDLC in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (1.2). Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (1.2). Reduce totalC and LDLC in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) (1.2). Reduce elevated totalC, LDLC, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy (1.2). Limitations of Use <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in Fredrickson Types I and V dyslipidemias. 1.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low HDLC, or a family history of early coronary heart disease, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is indicated to Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina In patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is indicated to Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of stroke In patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is indicated to Reduce the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures Reduce the risk of hospitalization for CHF Reduce the risk of angina 1.2 Hyperlipidemia <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is indicated As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG levels and to increase HDLC in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated serum TG levels (Fredrickson Type IV) For the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet To reduce totalC and LDLC in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable As an adjunct to diet to reduce totalC, LDLC, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present LDLC remains  190 mgdL or LDLC remains  160 mgdL and there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the pediatric patient 1.3 Limitations of Use <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in conditions where the major lipoprotein abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons (Fredrickson Types I and V).</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pediatric_use</i>:</td><td>"8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) .

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be advised that cholesterol is a chronic condition and they should adhere to their medication along with their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)recommended diet, a regular exercise program as appropriate, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel to determine goal attainment. Patients should be advised about substances they should not take concomitantly with atorvastatin see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Patients should also be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 17.1 Muscle Pain All patients starting therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be advised of the risk of myopathy and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. The risk of this occurring is increased when taking certain types of medication or consuming larger quantities (1 liter) of grapefruit juice. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their healthcare professional. 17.2 Liver Enzymes It is recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter. 17.3 Pregnancy Women of childbearing age should be advised to use an effective method of birth control to prevent pregnancy while using <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Discuss future pregnancy plans with your patients, and discuss when to stop <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> if they are trying to conceive. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant, they should stop taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and call their healthcare professional. 17.4 Breastfeeding Women who are breastfeeding should be advised to not use <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Patients who have a lipid disorder and are breastfeeding, should be advised to discuss the options with their healthcare professional.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or a Combination of Ritonavir plus Saquinavir or Lopinavir plus Ritonavir In patients taking cyclosporine, therapy should be limited to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg once daily. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, for doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> exceeding 20 mg, appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,305 participants (age range 4080 years, 19 women 94.6 Caucasians, 2.6 Africans, 1.5 South Asians, 1.3 mixedother) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5,168) or placebo (n5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of followup. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, hepatic failure, dizziness, memory impairment, depression, and peripheral neuropathy. 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 6.) TABLE 6. Dose Response in Patients With Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean  Change From Baseline)Results are pooled from 2 doseresponse studies.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine, fibrates, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. In cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued (5.1). Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, immunosuppressive drugs, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine Do not exceed 10 mg atorvastatin daily Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir) Caution when exceeding doses  20mg atorvastatin daily. The lowest dose necessary should be used. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter. Liver enzyme changes generally occur in the first 3 months of treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Should an increase in ALT or AST of 3 times ULN persist, reduction of dose or withdrawal of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recommended. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>contraindications</i>:</td><td>CONTRAINDICATIONS Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels (4.1). Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant (4.3). Nursing mothers (4.4). Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication (4.2). Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adverse_reactions</i>:</td><td>ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label Rhabdomyolysis and myopathy see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  Liver enzyme abnormalities see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7). Table 2 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions, regardless of causality, reported in  2 and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n8755), from seventeen placebocontrolled trials.

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,305 participants (age range 4080 years, 19 women 94.6 Caucasians, 2.6 Africans, 1.5 South Asians, 1.3 mixedother) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5,168) or placebo (n5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of followup. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>DOSAGE  ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

Data given as  change represent  difference relative to atorvastatin alone (i.e., 0  no change). See Sections The dose of saquinavir plus ritonavir in this study is not the clinically used dose. The increase in atorvastatin exposure when used clinically is likely to be higher than what was observed in this study. Therefore, caution should be applied and the lowest dose necessary should be used. Greater increases in AUC (up to 2.5 fold) andor Cmax (up to 71) have been reported with excessive grapefruit consumption ( 750 mL  1.2 liters per day). Single sample taken 816 h post dose. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of atorvastatin with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>CLINICAL STUDIES In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5).

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained andor persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Use with caution and with the lowest dose necessary ( Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipidaltering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with CHD or multiple risk factors for CHD, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be started simultaneously with diet. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is an inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase (statin) indicated as an adjunct therapy to diet to Reduce the risk of MI, stroke, revascularization procedures, and angina in patients without CHD, but with multiple risk factors (1.1). Reduce the risk of MI and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes without CHD, but with multiple risk factors (1.1). Reduce the risk of nonfatal MI, fatal and nonfatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for CHF, and angina in patients with CHD (1.1). Reduce elevated totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG levels and increase HDLC in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (1.2). Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (1.2). Reduce totalC and LDLC in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) (1.2). Reduce elevated totalC, LDLC, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy (1.2). Limitations of Use <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in Fredrickson Types I and V dyslipidemias. 1.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low HDLC, or a family history of early coronary heart disease, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is indicated to Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina In patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is indicated to Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of stroke In patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is indicated to Reduce the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction Reduce the risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures Reduce the risk of hospitalization for CHF Reduce the risk of angina 1.2 Hyperlipidemia <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is indicated As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG levels and to increase HDLC in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated serum TG levels (Fredrickson Type IV) For the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet To reduce totalC and LDLC in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable As an adjunct to diet to reduce totalC, LDLC, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present LDLC remains  190 mgdL or LDLC remains  160 mgdL and there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the pediatric patient 1.3 Limitations of Use <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in conditions where the major lipoprotein abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons (Fredrickson Types I and V).</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>information_for_patients</i>:</td><td>17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be advised that cholesterol is a chronic condition and they should adhere to their medication along with their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)recommended diet, a regular exercise program as appropriate, and periodic testing of a fasting lipid panel to determine goal attainment. Patients should be advised about substances they should not take concomitantly with atorvastatin see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Patients should also be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing a new medication that they are taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 17.1 Muscle Pain All patients starting therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be advised of the risk of myopathy and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if these muscle signs or symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. The risk of this occurring is increased when taking certain types of medication or consuming larger quantities (1 liter) of grapefruit juice. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their healthcare professional. 17.2 Liver Enzymes It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before the initiation of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur. All patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be advised to report promptly any symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. 17.3 Pregnancy Women of childbearing age should be advised to use an effective method of birth control to prevent pregnancy while using <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Discuss future pregnancy plans with your patients, and discuss when to stop <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> if they are trying to conceive. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant, they should stop taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and call their healthcare professional. 17.4 Breastfeeding Women who are breastfeeding should be advised to not use <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Patients who have a lipid disorder and are breastfeeding, should be advised to discuss the options with their healthcare professional.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate.

Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed.

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 6.) TABLE 6. Dose Response in Patients With Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean  Change From Baseline)Results are pooled from 2 doseresponse studies.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained andor persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your condition or treatment. If you have any questions about <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, ask your doctor or pharmacist. What is <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>? <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a prescription medicine that lowers cholesterol in your blood. It lowers the LDLC ("bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides in your blood. It can raise your HDLC ("good" cholesterol) as well. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is for adults and children over 10 whose cholesterol does not come down enough with exercise and a lowfat diet alone. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can lower the risk for heart attack, stroke, certain types of heart surgery, and chest pain in patients who have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease such as age, smoking, high blood pressure, low HDLC, heart disease in the family. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can lower the risk for heart attack or stroke in patients with diabetes and risk factors such as eye problems, kidney problems, smoking, or high blood pressure. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> starts to work in about 2 weeks. What is Cholesterol? Cholesterol and triglycerides are fats that are made in your body. They are also found in foods. You need some cholesterol for good health, but too much is not good for you. Cholesterol and triglycerides can clog your blood vessels. It is especially important to lower your cholesterol if you have heart disease, smoke, have diabetes or high blood pressure, are older, or if heart disease starts early in your family.

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at (18004381985 and www.pfizer.com) or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,305 participants (age range 4080 years, 19 women 94.6 Caucasians, 2.6 Africans, 1.5 South Asians, 1.3 mixedother) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5,168) or placebo (n5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of followup. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol.

Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. Figure Figure Figure 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 78 (55.7). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) .

Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained andor persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility</i>:</td><td>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients with HIV taking nelfinavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at (18004381985 and www.pfizer.com) or FDA at 1800FDA1088 or www.fda.govmedwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,305 participants (age range 4080 years, 19 women 94.6 Caucasians, 2.6 Africans, 1.5 South Asians, 1.3 mixedother) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5,168) or placebo (n5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of followup. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>

Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. Figure Figure Figure 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

The safety and efficacy of doses above 20 mg have not been studied in controlled trials in children. The longterm efficacy of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo.

<tr><td><i>nonclinical_toxicology</i>:</td><td>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mgkgday, 2 rare tumors were found in muscle in highdose females in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. In cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility.

<tr><td><i>pregnancy</i>:</td><td>4.3 Pregnancy Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Other LipidLowering Medications Use with fibrate products or lipidmodifying doses (1 gday) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7). Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.7). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . The coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with gemfibrozil should be avoided see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is used in combination with niacin a reduction in <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dosage should be considered in this setting see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) . 7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.8 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.9 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.10 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment. 7.11 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</td></tr>

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7). Table 2 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions, regardless of causality, reported in  2 and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n8755), from seventeen placebocontrolled trials.

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,305 participants (age range 4080 years, 19 women 94.6 Caucasians, 2.6 Africans, 1.5 South Asians, 1.3 mixedother) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5,168) or placebo (n5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of followup. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use see Warnings and Precautions (5.1). There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5). The overall risk reduction was consistent regardless of age (65, 65) or gender.

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group. 14.2 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, and TG, and increases HDLC in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly. In two multicenter, placebocontrolled, doseresponse studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 6.) TABLE 6. Dose Response in Patients With Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean  Change From Baseline)Results are pooled from 2 doseresponse studies.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

The safety and efficacy of doses above 20 mg have not been studied in controlled trials in children. The longterm efficacy of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established. Figure 1 Figure Figure</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>pharmacodynamics</i>:</td><td>12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained andor persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (5.1, 8.5). Liver enzyme abnormalities Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of immunemediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir) Avoid atorvastatin HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir) Use with caution and lowest dose necessary Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavirUse with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3), darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir) Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir) Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine see Drug Interactions (7.11) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms andor hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, including <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>teratogenic_effects</i>:</td><td>Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm.

In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ., 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>pharmacokinetics</i>:</td><td>12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>drug_interactions</i>:</td><td>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipidmodifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis (2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine Do not exceed 10 mg atorvastatin daily Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir) Caution when exceeding doses  20 mg atorvastatin daily. The lowest dose necessary should be used. Digoxin Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.5). Oral Contraceptives Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.6). Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (7.4). 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4. Clarithromycin Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Combination of Protease Inhibitors Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg with ritonavir plus saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 20 mg with lopinavir plus ritonavir (400 mg  100 mg twice daily) compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking HIV protease inhibitors, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . Itraconazole Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose exceeds 20 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6) . 7.2 Grapefruit Juice Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (1.2 liters per day). 7.3 Cyclosporine Atorvastatin and atorvastatinmetabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mgkgday compared to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> alone see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . In cases where coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with cyclosporine is necessary, the dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should not exceed 10 mg see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . 7.4 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Concomitant administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. 7.5 Digoxin When multiple doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives Coadministration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. 7.7 Warfarin <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>indications_and_usage</i>:</td><td>1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipidaltering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with CHD or multiple risk factors for CHD, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be started simultaneously with diet. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is an inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase (statin) indicated as an adjunct therapy to diet to Reduce the risk of MI, stroke, revascularization procedures, and angina in patients without CHD, but with multiple risk factors (1.1). Reduce the risk of MI and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes without CHD, but with multiple risk factors (1.1). Reduce the risk of nonfatal MI, fatal and nonfatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for CHF, and angina in patients with CHD (1.1). Reduce elevated totalC, LDLC, apo B, and TG levels and increase HDLC in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (1.2).

Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of longterm therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> use during pregnancy however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) . 4.4 Nursing mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should not breastfeed their infants see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>description</i>:</td><td>11 DESCRIPTION <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a synthetic lipidlowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, an early and ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin calcium is R(R, R)2(4fluorophenyl), dihydroxy5(1methylethyl)3phenyl4(phenylamino)carbonyl1Hpyrrole1heptanoic acid, calcium salt (21) trihydrate. The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca3H2O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is Atorvastatin calcium is a white to offwhite crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile slightly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methanol. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> Tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients calcium carbonate, USP candelilla wax, FCC croscarmellose sodium, NF hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF lactose monohydrate, NF magnesium stearate, NF microcrystalline cellulose, NF Opadry White YS17040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide) polysorbate 80, NF simethicone emulsion.

<tr><td><i>dosage_and_administration</i>:</td><td>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dose range 10 to 80 mg once daily (2.1). Recommended start dose 10 or 20 mg once daily (2.1). Patients requiring large LDLC reduction (45) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose 10 mg once daily maximum recommended dose 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDLC (more than 45) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 to 80 mg once daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation andor upon titration of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) The recommended starting dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 10 mgday the maximum recommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) . Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used as an adjunct to other lipidlowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant LipidLowering Therapy <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) . 2.5 Dosage in Patients With Renal Impairment Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) . 2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or a Combination of Ritonavir plus Saquinavir or Lopinavir plus Ritonavir In patients taking cyclosporine, therapy should be limited to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg once daily. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, for doses of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> exceeding 20 mg, appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is employed see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1), Drug Interactions (7) .</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>mechanism_of_action</i>:</td><td>12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</td></tr>

In the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> placebocontrolled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 7311 placebo age range 1093 years, 39 women, 91 Caucasians, 3 Blacks, 2 Asians, 4 other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7 of patients on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 9.5 of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were myalgia (0.7), diarrhea (0.5), nausea (0.4), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence  2 and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in placebo controlled trials (n8755) were nasopharyngitis (8.3), arthralgia (6.9), diarrhea (6.8), pain in extremity (6.0), and urinary tract infection (5.7).

Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 2,838 subjects (age range 3977 years, 32 women 94.3 Caucasians, 2.4 South Asians, 2.3 AfroCaribbean, 1.0 other) with type 2 diabetes treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n1,428) or placebo (n1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 10,001 subjects (age range 2978 years, 19 women 94.1 Caucasians, 2.9 Blacks, 1.0 Asians, 2.0 other) with clinically evident CHD treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5006) or <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg daily (n4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the highdose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8 497, 9.9, respectively) as compared to the lowdose group (69, 1.4 404, 8.1, respectively) during a median followup of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (3  ULN twice within 410 days) occurred in 62 (1.3) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( 10  ULN) were low overall, but were higher in the highdose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3) compared to the lowdose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL see Clinical Studies (14.1)  involving 8,888 subjects (age range 2680 years, 19 women 99.3 Caucasians, 0.4 Asians, 0.3 Blacks, 0.04 other) treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday (n4439) or simvastatin 2040 mg daily (n4449), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median followup of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 2192 years, 40 women 93.3 Caucasians, 3.0 Blacks, 0.6 Asians, 3.1 other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg (n2365) or placebo (n2366) for a median followup of 4.9 years, there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations ( 3  ULN twice within 410 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9) compared to placebo (0.1). Elevations of CK (10  ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1) compared to placebo (0.0). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8) in the placebo group see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) . In a posthoc analysis, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (2182365, 9.2 vs. 2742366, 11.6) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (552365, 2.3 vs. 332366, 1.4) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 nonfatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke 7 (16) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 2 (4) placebo. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 216 (9.1) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 211 (8.9) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (3.3) than in the placebo group (4.1). The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group (5.0) than in the placebo group (4.0). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, StevensJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, hepatic failure, dizziness, memory impairment, depression, and peripheral neuropathy. 6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) In a 26week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n140, 31 female 92 Caucasians, 1.6 Blacks, 1.6 Asians, 4.8 other), the safety and tolerability profile of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>clinical_pharmacology</i>:</td><td>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme that converts 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (highdensity lipoprotein), IDL (intermediatedensity lipoprotein), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein), and VLDL (verylowdensity lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the highaffinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (totalC), LDLcholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, while increased levels of HDLC are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. In animal models, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces LDLC in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipidlowering medication(s). A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of totalC, LDLC, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDLC) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDLC (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of totalC and LDLC, and inversely with the level of HDLC. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also reduces VLDLC and TG and produces variable increases in HDLC and apolipoprotein A1. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces totalC, LDLC, VLDLC, apo B, TG, and nonHDLC, and increases HDLC in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDLC) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Like LDL, cholesterolenriched triglyceriderich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDLC levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with nonlipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is rapidly absorbed after oral administration maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMGCoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa andor hepatic firstpass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25 and 9, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDLC reduction is similar whether <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is given with or without food. Plasma <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> concentrations are lower (approximately 30 for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDLC reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration see Dosage and Administration (2) . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is approximately 381 liters. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is likely to be secreted in human milk see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) . Metabolism <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is extensively metabolized to ortho and parahydroxylated derivatives and various betaoxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by ortho and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme see Drug Interactions (7.1) . In animals, the orthohydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic andor extrahepatic metabolism however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination halflife of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the halflife of inhibitory activity for HMGCoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax and 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDLlowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) . Pediatric Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Gender Plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in women differ from those in men (approximately 20 higher for Cmax and 10 lower for AUC) however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDLC reduction with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDLC reduction of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) . Hemodialysis While studies have not been conducted in patients with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4fold greater in patients with ChildsPugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16fold and 11fold increased, respectively, in patients with ChildsPugh B disease see Contraindications (4.1) . TABLE 3.

<tr><td><i>clinical_studies</i>:</td><td>14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 4080 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels 251 mgdL (6.5 mmolL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors male gender (81.1), age 55 years (84.5), smoking (33.2), diabetes (24.3), history of CHD in a firstdegree relative (26), TCHDL 6 (14.3), peripheral vascular disease (5.1), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8), specific ECG abnormality (14.3), proteinuriaalbuminuria (62.4). In this doubleblind, placebocontrolled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal BP 14090 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients 13080 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (n5168) or placebo (n5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years. The effect of 10 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of coronary events either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) or nonfatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group) with a relative risk reduction of 36 (based on incidences of 1.9 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> vs. 3.0 for placebo), p0.0005 (see Figure 1). The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive. Figure 1 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Cumulative Incidence of NonFatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOTLLA) <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42. Although the reduction of fatal and nonfatal strokes did not reach a predefined significance level (p0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26 relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7 for <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 2.3 for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p0.17). In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94 white, 68 male), ages 4075 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL  160 mgdL and TG  600 mgdL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors current smoking (23), hypertension (80), retinopathy (30), or microalbuminuria (9) or macroalbuminuria (3). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, doubleblind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 11 ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint. Baseline characteristics of subjects were mean age of 62 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 median LDLC 120 mgdL median TC 207 mgdL median TG 151 mgdL median HDLC 52 mgdL. The effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37, HR 0.63, 95 CI (0.48, 0.83) (p0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48 (21 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95 CI (0.31, 0.89) (p0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42 (38 events in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 CI (0.39, 0.86) (p0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death. There were 61 deaths in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p0.059). Figure 2 Effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event (myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke) in CARDS In the Treating to New Targets Study (TNT), the effect of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday vs. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday on the reduction in cardiovascular events was assessed in 10,001 subjects (94 white, 81 male, 38 65 years) with clinically evident coronary heart disease who had achieved a target LDLC level 130 mgdL after completing an 8week, openlabel, runin period with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mgday. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mgday or 80 mgday of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and followed for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was the timetofirst occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE) death due to CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, nonHDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mgdL during treatment with 10 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80 mgday group vs. 548 events in the 10 mgday group) with a relative risk reduction of 22, HR 0.78, 95 CI (0.69, 0.89), p0.0002 (see Figure 3 and Table 5).

Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospitalization for heart failure, but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospitalization was only observed in the 8 of patients with a prior history of CHF. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for allcause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group than in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg treatment group. In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday was compared to treatment with simvastatin 2040 mgday in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81), white (99) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDLC of 121.5 mgdL at randomization 76 were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, openlabel, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no runin period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDLC, TC, TG, HDL, and nonHDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mgdL during treatment with 80 mg of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mgdL during treatment with 2040 mg of simvastatin. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the rate of first major coronary event (fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) 411 (9.3) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 463 (10.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group, HR 0.89, 95 CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p0.07. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for allcause mortality 366 (8.2) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mgday group vs. 374 (8.4) in the simvastatin 2040 mgday group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or nonCV death were similar for the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group and the simvastatin 2040 mg group.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in totalC, LDLC, TG, totalCHDLC, and LDLCHDLC. In three multicenter, doubleblind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7). TABLE 7.

The mean LDLC reduction in this study was 18. Twentyfive patients with a reduction in LDLC had a mean response of 20 (range of 7 to 53, median of 24) the remaining 4 patients had 7 to 24 increases in LDLC. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDLreceptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDLC. The remaining 3 receptornegative patients had a mean LDLC reduction of 22. 14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients In a doubleblind, placebocontrolled study followed by an openlabel phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 1017 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (n140) or placebo (n47) for 26 weeks and then all received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDLC level  190 mgdL or 2) a baseline LDLC level  160 mgdL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or seconddegree relative. The mean baseline LDLC value was 218.6 mgdL (range 138.5385.0 mgdL) in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> group compared to 230.0 mgdL (range 160.0324.5 mgdL) in the placebo group. The dosage of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDLC level was  130 mgdL. The number of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the doubleblind phase was 80 (57.1). <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> significantly decreased plasma levels of totalC, LDLC, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26week doubleblind phase (see Table 10).

<tr><td><i>use_in_specific_populations</i>:</td><td>"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment Plasma concentrations markedly increased in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (12.3). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on longterm outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of atorvastatin use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deathsstillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a threetofourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89 of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mgkgday or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mgm2) see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) . In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mgkgday, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mgkgday. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mgkgday pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mgkgday. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mgkgday and acoustic startle at 225 mgkgday pinnae detachment and eyeopening at 225 mgkgday). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mgkg) and 22 times (225 mgkg) the human AUC at 80 mgday. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50 and 40, respectively, of that in their mothers milk. Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants see Contraindications (4) . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in patients 1017 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls see Clinical Studies (14.6) Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 1017 years) (6.3)  and Dosage and Administration, Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (1017 years of age) (2.2) . Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) . <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age. Clinical efficacy with doses up to 80 mgday for 1 year have been evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with homozygous FH including 8 pediatric patients see Clinical Studies, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (14.5) . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 39,828 patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical studies, 15,813 (40) were 65 years old and 2,800 (7) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ."</td></tr>

This dose represents a plasma AUC (024) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. A 2year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mgkgday resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in highdose males and liver carcinomas in highdose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (024) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose. In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mgkg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epididymis of 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mgkgday of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose) testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mgkg and epididymal weight was lower at 100 mgkg. Male rats given 100 mgkgday for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mgkg for two years.</td></tr>

The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDLC reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response see Dosage and Administration (2) .</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>warnings_and_cautions</i>:</td><td>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine, fibrates, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age ( 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. In cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued (5.1). Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment (5.2). A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group vs. placebo (5.5). 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values 10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathyrhabdomyolysis. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, andor marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir, immunosuppressive drugs, azole antifungals, or lipidmodifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7) ). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 see also Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of MyopathyRhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Cyclosporine Do not exceed 10 mg atorvastatin daily Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir plus saquinavir or lopinavir plus ritonavir) Caution when exceeding doses  20mg atorvastatin daily. The lowest dose necessary should be used. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Statins, like some other lipidlowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (3 times the upper limit of normal ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7 of patients who received <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.3 for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. It is recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter. Liver enzyme changes generally occur in the first 3 months of treatment with <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b>. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Should an increase in ALT or AST of 3 times ULN persist, reduction of dose or withdrawal of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> is recommended. <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol andor have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> see Contraindications (4.1) . 5.3 Endocrine Function Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal andor gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 5.4 CNS Toxicity Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mgkgday. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mgkgday. The 120 mgkg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma areaunderthecurve (AUC, 024 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mgday. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mgkgday and one at 120 mgkgday) in a 2year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mgkgday or in rats at doses up to 100 mgkgday. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (024) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mgday. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dosedependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. 5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA In a posthoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the <b style='color:red'>Lipitor</b> 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3 atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4 placebo HR 1.68, 95 CI 1.09, 2.59 p0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group see Adverse Reactions (6.1) .</td></tr>
